MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, met with the country's outgoing leader on Tuesday, hours after the leftist said he would put his job on the line to a recall referendum half-way through his six-year term.

Lopez Obrador, who won a landslide victory in Sunday's election and takes office in December, traveled in a white Volkswagen sedan on Tuesday to the meeting with centrist President Enrique Pena Nieto in the presidential palace in the capital's colonial downtown district.

Lopez Obrador and Pena Nieto were due to discuss the 2019 budget, trade and energy policy. The president-elect said he would hold a news conference after the meeting.

The former mayor of Mexico City won 53 percent of the vote on Sunday, the largest margin for a presidential election since the early 1990s, giving him a strong mandate to make deep changes to policy at home and abroad.

Lopez Obrador discussed immigration, trade and security with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday.

His pick as foreign minister, Hector Vasconcelos, said on Tuesday the call between the two leaders, conducted via translators, had provided a reset in strained relations between the two countries.

""It was very successful, characterized by absolute mutual respect,"" he told TV network Televisa, saying there was no date yet for the two men to meet.

Lopez Obrador, who shuns bodyguards, was surrounded by TV cameramen on motorbikes during his drive to the palace, and arrived there to a turbulent media scrum.

He said he sought to unite the country.

""I'm looking forward to conciliation to seek an organized transition for everyone,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters, who pushed and shoved in a bid to speak with him. ""I don't want bodyguards ... we won't act in that way, but I also don't want to be squashed.""

Lopez Obrador vows to improve lives for Mexicans and the country's global reputation by ending corruption, applying the law and reducing the wealth gap.

In a TV interview late on Monday, he said he would hold a recall referendum after three years to ask the public whether it still had faith in his presidency. He had previously said he would hold a referendum every two years.

""Just as they elected me, they'll have the chance to remove me, but I'm sure I'll win as there will be results,"" he said, reiterating a campaign promise.

POPULAR CONSULTATIONS

The 64-year-old has not given specific details of how the ""popular consultation"" would be carried out. Mexico's constitution does not mention recall referendums.

The head of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) has previously suggested he could put a series of economic reforms - which include oil, education and telecoms overhauls pushed through Congress by Pena Nieto - to public referendums, but has given few details.

In Monday's interview, Lopez Obrador also said he would not make any attempt to run for a second presidential term, which is currently prohibited by the law, and would require a constitutional change.

Recall referendums have a checkered past in Latin America, where political control has often swung between the left and right.

In 2004, Venezuela's opposition called such a plebiscite to try and oust socialist former President Hugo Chavez. Nonetheless, Chavez went on to win the referendum, clinching 59 percent of the vote.

For over a decade, Lopez Obrador has faced attacks from critics who alleged he was a socialist in the mold of Chavez, and could take Mexico down a similar path as struggling Venezuela.

Lopez Obrador has rejected such comparisons, and in the final days of his campaign, committed to respect central bank independence, individual liberties and free enterprise, saying there would be no ""dictatorship"" in Mexico.

Agustin Basave, a lawmaker with the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), which Lopez Obrador led before forming his own party in 2014, said the referendum would strengthen Lopez Obrador if he were to win it, but would not help the country.

""In terms of governability, it doesn't help. It causes harm. Because effectively, you have doubt over how long his term will last,"" he said. ""And what if he loses the referendum?""

3B286OTISFZK1UXB2OX17D4P6O8JA6,Is football dying? Why I secretly wish that were true.,"CLOSE As kids head back to school, you may want to rethink whether your child should play tackle football. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY

I won't admit it if you ask, but I wouldn't mind if football goes the way of the dodo.

Sponsor: Rep. Heather Carter, R-Cave Creek

Football appears to be dying a slow death.

A growing number of kids donâ€™t want to play the sport, and a growing number of schools arenâ€™t offering it.

And as much as it pains me to say this, part of me thinks that's good. A part of me hopes that by the time my toddler gets old enough to choose a sport (if he even decides to play sports), football will be so last season that he wonâ€™t seriously consider it.

I know. How did I become that mom?

I like watching football. And Iâ€™ve long been OK with the idea of my son getting in the game, taking those crazy hard hits like his dad did when he played football in school.

Because thatâ€™s the sport. Itâ€™s rough. There will be injuries. Kids (and parents) should know that going into it.

Concussions are serious business

We're learning a lot about the damage concussions can do to a forming brain, and it's seriously scary. Iâ€™ve long heard that repeated knocks to the head, like those that add up over years of professional or college play, can cause all sorts of problems.

But now research is showing that even one concussion can do lasting damage to the brain. Even a few hard hits that aren't concussions could have ill effects (which is worrisome enough if you have a boy. I mean, they're always hitting their heads).

More: Don't blame immigration for Mollie Tibbetts' death, blame misogyny

Why â€” despite sexual abuse scandal â€” I am still a faithful Catholic

My son was murdered by an illegal immigrant. Neither he nor Mollie Tibbetts deserved to die.

Yes, the gear is getting better. Helmets are evolving. The rules also are changing to minimize the likelihood of injury (which even I have argued will ruin the sport. Itâ€™s supposed to be rough and tumble, right?).

But not all programs follow the protocols to minimize the risk of injury or yank kids from a game if they appear hurt. Boys will play through injuries or downplay what's happening, especially if they think their absence could change the outcome of the game. Itâ€™s in their nature.

Thatâ€™s why I feel so conflicted about football. I'm not one of those moms who thinks she can protect her baby from everything. I don't even want to try.

Maybe it's not so bad to be unathletic

Not to mention that for most of my life, I have rued the fact that I have the athletic ability of a pencil. I look at people like my husband who are naturally good at sports, and I marvel at their coordination, how throwing and running and jumping looks graceful for them.

His entire side of the family is that way. Iâ€™ve joked that I hope our kiddo inherits his genes â€” so he can do all the things I canâ€™t.

But now thereâ€™s a part of me that hopes my kid takes after my awkward side and doesnâ€™t play sports.

I tamp down those thoughts when they pop up, and then go play catch with my kid (he's got a decent arm, and luckily, heâ€™s still young enough not to know how horrendous I am at it).

I tell myself that I need to support him, no matter whether he wants to play football or trumpet. Itâ€™s not my job to project my affinities or aversions onto choices that, in the grand scheme of things, are relatively inconsequential.

But, man, football is going to be rough one to endure. If itâ€™s still around when that day comes, that is.

3BJKPTD2QDU6EEFXGTXR49G84PZRTT,"In Arizona Primary, Joe Arpaio Is Making His Last Stand","â€œIn other words, Arpaio doesnâ€™t stand a chance in hell in todayâ€™s Arizona,â€ said Carlos VÃ©lez-IbÃ¡Ã±ez, a scholar of border studies. â€œThe guy also has to deal with the same Republicans who voted him out of office in 2016,â€ he added, referring to the sheriffâ€™s election won by Paul Penzone, a Democrat.

Venomous insults have been lobbed between the Republican campaigns this primary season. Kelli Ward, a hard-right former state senator known for promoting conspiracy theories, is vying with Mr. Arpaio for the support of Trump loyalists, while Martha McSally, a former Air Force fighter pilot, remains in the lead.

Some conservatives here were already critical of the controversies around Mr. Arpaio, if only because Maricopa County has spent tens of millions of dollars for his legal defense in various lawsuits. Others say his aggressive conservative positioning is out of step at a time when appealing to relatively moderate independents is viewed as important in challenging Democrats, who are growing more forceful in Arizona.

Signaling their own assessment of Mr. Arpaioâ€™s chances, Democratic and Independent campaign committees have spent more than $2 million opposing Ms. McSally, the perceived Republican front-runner in the race, according to The Arizona Republic.

Ms. Sinema, running against the lawyer and consultant Deedra Abboud on the Democratic side, is running well ahead in the polls and already is focusing her attention on the fall campaign.

To appeal to voters in the Republican base who often cast ballots in primaries, all three candidates have sought to promote their support of Mr. Trump. Ms. McSally has shifted to the right, becoming more hard-line on immigration, but not as hard-line as Mr. Arpaio, who has said he wants to deploy the Army to Mexico to combat drug smuggling.

â€œI think he peaked long ago,â€ Dan Eberhart, a prominent Republican donor in Arizona, said of Mr. Arpaio. â€œWard and Arpaio have been in a wrestling match for the far-right vote,â€ calling the campaigning â€œunfortunate.â€ â€œBut their battle clears a path for McSally. At the end of the day, sheâ€™s our best chance for keeping the seat.â€",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/us/arpaio-arizona-senate.html,"['Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral']","['3', '1', '1', '1', '1']"
3MVY4USGB75S6FZZ16YSGCJVFCOISH,"Macron Declares War on Salvini-Orban Bloc, â€˜I Am Their Chief Adversaryâ€™","French President Emmanuel Macron has declared war on the European populist bloc spearheaded by Matteo Salvini and Viktor OrbÃ¡n, saying Wednesday that he is their â€œchief adversary.â€

Following meetings in Milan Tuesday, the Italian interior minister and Hungarian prime minister jointly vowed to demolish the current European Union (EU) globalist structure led by Macron, replacing it with a model that respects the national sovereignty of EU countries.

â€œIn Europe, Macron is at the head of the parties that support immigration, on the other side are we ourselves, but we want to stop illegal immigration,â€ Mr. OrbÃ¡n declared Tuesday.

Matteo Salvini suggested that Mr. Macron should lead by example rather than lecturing other countries.

â€œWe ask for collaboration from Macron â€” who spends his time giving lessons to foreign governments â€” by setting the example of opening Ventimiglia,â€ a border point between France and Italy currently closed to migrants.

â€œIf he gives a good example,â€ Salvini said, â€œthen we can also ask the VisegrÃ¡d countries.â€

The VisegrÃ¡d Group â€” comprising Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia â€” has resisted immigration quotas imposed by Brussels, insisting that their own citizens have the right to receive migrants or not.

â€œI will not give anything away to the nationalists and those who defend hate speech,â€ Macron countered Wednesday in an interview on French television. â€œIf they want to see me as their chief adversary, they are right.â€

Going still further, Mr. Macron said that France is â€œan enemy of nationalism, of the politics of hatred, and of a Europe that must pay what is asked for and yet does not impose any form of responsibility or solidarity.â€

â€œIn the coming days and months we will have to make in-depth decisions to address the issue of migration,â€ Macron said. â€œThis implies seriousness and a spirit of responsibility, remaining faithful to our values, such as the right to asylum, with a real policy governing relations between countries of origin and our own.â€

Mr. Macron distanced himself from the Salvini-OrbÃ¡n bloc, which has focused on reining in illegal immigration, saying that the two worldviews are diametrically opposed.

â€œThis is not what OrbÃ¡n and Salvini propose,â€ the French president said.

â€œA strong opposition is forming between nationalists and progressivesâ€ in Europe, noted Macron, who is currently traveling between Denmark and Finland in search of allies to forge a â€œprogressive arcâ€ of globalist nations against pro-sovereignty governments, according to reports.

Salvini was swift to respond to Macron Wednesday, assuring him that his real enemy are his own citizens.

â€œMacronâ€™s chief adversary is the French people, at least according to surveys,â€ Mr. Salvini said.

â€œRather than lecturing other governments, let him open up the French borders, beginning with Ventimiglia,â€ he said.

â€œAnd he should stop destabilizing Libya for economic interests,â€ Salvini added.

38EHZ67RINABCTGZRL23JR7988SMGR,Chain migration is why I'm here. Ending it is a mistake,"CLOSE In Trump's State of the Union address, he proposed changing the family-immigration system that allows legal immigrants to sponsor family members for green cards, an act that some call ""chain migration."" Alejandro Barahona/azcentral Wochit

How does ridding the country of people like me â€” who came here by so-called chain migration â€” make America any more prosperous or safe?

A demonstrator protesting against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Trump administration's immigration policies holds a sign in Chicago. (Photo: Joshua Lott, Getty Images)

Iâ€™m an American. Iâ€™m also apparently part of our immigration problem.

Iâ€™m still perplexed as to how. More why than how, really.

Iâ€™m equally perplexed as to how ridding the U.S. of people like me would make our country more prosperous and more secure.

It's a solution President Donald Trump continues to tout, even if his wife's parents became citizens by the exact process that brought me to the United States.

'Chain migration' is an ugly phrase

I'm talking about his plan to end chain migration. Or family reunification. Sponsorship by any other name that in some quarters now breeds contempt and suspicion. Or worse.

I donâ€™t see the practice as lax or irresponsible. Certainly not alarming or dangerous, as many of our countryâ€™s political leaders have now come to conclude.

The one truth in the political narrative is this: Family members bring over the extended family, one by one. The rest of the story is far less sinister.

In my family's case, the person most culpable â€” from my perspective, the person I'm most indebted to â€” is my motherâ€™s eldest biological brother, Leslie Yee, whom I saw a handful of times and thought of mostly as a distant memory, as is often the case for children with adults other than their own parents.

Uncle Leslie started our chain

Uncle Leslie came to the U.S. from the Guangdong province in southern China in 1939, at the time a sprite, really. He arrived in Seattle and, though he loved the area â€” I suspect the proximity to the water, which was reminiscent of his ancestral home, had something to do with it â€” he, like many immigrants, took the more practical road.

More: I'm a DREAMer, I just want to contribute to my community. Why does my government want me out?

Forget the wall already, it's time for the U.S. to have open borders

My grandfather wouldn't be allowed into America under Donald Trump's policies

He joined the U.S. Coast Guard in WWII and settled afterwards in Arizona, first in Phoenix, then in Casa Grande. There, he bought the famed Owl Cafe on Main Street in 1950 and ran that and the accompanying boarding house for some nine years before constructing a modest 25 by 60-foot restaurant of his own on Pinal Avenue that served American and Chinese food.

A dogged worker â€” the restaurant opened 7 days a week â€” Uncle Leslie also labored at his first love, accounting. According to a profile in the Casa Grande Dispatch in 1971, he took on clients from the town as well as others who were scattered across Arizona.

Even at 9, I had to prove myself

With his earnings, he had married and raised a family of two children. Beginning in the 60s, he started sponsoring his siblings to join him, first with my aunt Cuan Kok. Even then it took a good while, so long that by the time she got approval four to five years later, she had already migrated to Canada.

Even at 9, Abe Kwok needed a letter of recommendation from his headmaster to immigrate. (Photo: Abe Kwok/The Republic)

Uncle Leslie in the 70s sponsored his mother â€” my grandmother â€” who was already in her 70s; another of my aunts, Hanna Ho, and her family; and then my mother and our family. He spent thousands of dollars on each sponsorship, trekking to San Francisco to meet with an immigration attorney and typing out the family tree on onionskin paper as part of the application.

My family immigrated in June 1975 and settled in Tucson. I was 9. Before we were approved, my parents had amassed volumes of information â€” bank accounts, passports, professional and education background, business and personal affiliations and associations, and letters attesting to our character and community standing.

On my motherâ€™s side â€” she was one of 12 children that her father had from two wives â€” none of the siblings remained in China. Those still alive are all living in the U.S. save for my aunt Kok, who still resides in Canada.

Our family's the rule, not the exception

My youngest uncle, Joe Yee, operated two Farmerâ€™s Market grocery stores and apartments in Tucson; Aunt Hanna ran Chinese Village Restaurant and another, also in Tucson; my late mother and my dad operated China Restaurant in east Tucson. None of them, or their children, had serious brushes with the law. Or depended on government subsidies. Or pledged their loyalty and allegiance to China instead of the United States, or consider themselves anything but American.

That's because we are Americans. We became naturalized citizens, waiting for years as legal citizens to become even eligible. We all call America home.

I donâ€™t believe our extended family is an outlier. We represent the chain-migration rule, not the exception.

That the immigration debate has pitted legal immigrants â€” citizens, in many cases â€” against those who entered unlawfully is unsettling. That chain migration has become demonized is unforgivable; and that some continue to peddle that false narrative is unconscionable.

The angriest Americans may see chain migration as something sinister. But my Uncle Leslie, who spent his final years bringing over among the last of his siblings, viewed it as nothing less than family responsibility.

His actions and intent should not be debased.

3P6ENY9P7AE3G6LJQCMTCYCT6QDIHG,Maine's robust public financing boost grassroots campaigns for governor in big ways,"Two other Democrats both raised a decent amount of cash: State Attorney General Janet Mills brought in a sizable $572,000 and had $279,000 on hand, while former state House Speaker Mark Eves raised $305,000, although he had just $87,000 in his war chest. However, state Sen. Mark Dion raised a mere $33,000 over more than six months, although it's important to note that legislators are banned from raising money from lobbyists and their employers during the legislative session, which ran from Jan. 1 through April 18. Finally, former state Rep. Diane Russell did not file a report by the deadline.

On the Republican side, state Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason was the lone candidate to participate in public financing. He raised $37,000 to qualify for the $400,000 in public funds and finished with $210,000 in cash-on-hand. Businessman Shawn Moody led the fundraising chase with $575,000 from donors and another $300,000 from his own pocket, leaving him with a sizable $409,000 stockpiled for the last several weeks of the race.

Meanwhile, former state health commissioner Mary Mayhew raised $300,000, but that was over almost an entire year, leaving her with just $84,000 in the bank and suggesting she might have trouble raising money down the final stretch. Finally, state House Speaker Ken Fredette raised a mere $21,000 and looks unlikely to be much of a factor on the airwaves.

Of course, it wouldn't be a Maine gubernatorial election without a serious independent candidate, and this year's contest has two of them. State Treasurer Terry Hayes raised $98,000 to qualify for $200,000 in public funding, leaving her with $120,000 in the bank. But Hayes is already on the general election ballot, meaning she'll be guaranteed another $600,000 after the primary is over. Meanwhile, entrepreneur Alan Caron raised a $495,000 from donors and loaned himself a hefty $450,000, giving him $333,000 on-hand near the end of April.

Senate

â— IN-Sen: A new report from The Associated Press paints a very different picture of wealthy businessman and former state Rep. Mike Braun than the image he has projected in his ads and campaign, and it doesn't portray the self-funding Republican in a positive light one week ahead of the May 8 primary. Braun has cast himself as a successful businessman and job-creator who will take on career politicians, those who outsource jobs, and businesses that rely on government subsidies. But The AP has found a litany of labor law violations, a business empire that relies on foreign goods, and subsidies worth millions that Braun has pursued.

Braun, who is worth between $37 million and $95 million, has heavily self-funded his campaign against Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita, leaning hard into the ""run government like a business"" angle. However, his trucking company was cited nearly 100 times since 2015 by the Transportation Department for unsafe driving violations, while his businesses have also faced and settled lawsuits over violating federal law to underpay employees and force truckers to drive too many hours per day.

Braun is also a hypocrite on the issue of trade, having cast himself as a protector of American jobs and manufacturing while voting against a bill to let local governments recoup financial incentives from companies that outsource jobs abroad. With just a week until Election Day, it might be too late for Messer and Rokita to gain traction by calling out Braun's hypocrisy, but if he ends up becoming the GOP nominee, Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly can assuredly try to use those same vulnerabilities against him.

Meanwhile, Rokita's latest ad imitates Trump live-tweeting Fox &amp; Friends by calling the special counsel investigation into Trump a ""witch hunt"" orchestrated by Democrats, James Comey, and Robert Mueller. It then blasts Messer as a ""Never-Trumper"" and Braun as a ""Democrat"" who repeatedly voted for tax increases, while Rokita promises to deliver on Trump's immigration proposals.

â— MN-Sen-B: Appointed Sen. Tina Smith drew her first notable Democratic primary challenger on Monday, but the man hoping to unseat her is anything but a conventional Democrat. Richard Painter, a longtime Republican who served as chief ethics lawyer for the George W. Bush White House, recently announced his intention to run for Smith's Senate seat.

Painter has been visible on cable news and social media as a prominent Republican critic of Trump, and he serves as the vice chairman of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group. He claims he's running because Smith and Minnesota Democrats supposedly aren't doing enough to stand up to Trump, and he called for Trump's removal from office. However, he also described himself as ""a centrist in many waysâ€”right up the middle,"" which isn't likely to endear him to Democrats skeptical of his recent party switch.

Painter also demonstrated how out of step he is with the #MeToo movement that resulted in there even being a special election for this seat in the first place when he tweeted at the time of former Sen. Al Franken's groping scandal that the whole thing was a ""set up job"" by Fox News and notoriously shady GOP operative Roger Stone. When recently asked about those past statements, Painter continued to dodge the issue by saying it was the job of the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate allegations of sexual assault, not for public outcry to force resignations.

It's hard to see how Painter has much of a much of a chance at beating Smith in the Aug. 14 primary. The first-time candidate is challenging an incumbent who has the full support of state and national Democrats, and Smith has no obvious flaws that would give Democratic primary voters much reason to fire her.

â— MT-Sen: America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC, has dropped $344,000 for an ad attacking Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. The spot tries to hit Tester for his leading role in blocking Trump's effort to nominate Dr. Ronny Jackson, who serves as the official physician to the president, to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Jackson withdrew his nomination after reports came out alleging he drank on the job and over-prescribed medications like narcotics, but the ad claims those allegations are false and accuses Tester of trying to stand in the way of Trump.

Meanwhile, former Judge Russ Fagg is up with his first primary ad, which leans hard into what has become this cycle's standard GOP playbook of xenophobia. The spot claims ""criminal illegal aliens threaten America"" as ominous images of tattooed Latino gang members appear on screen, while Fagg advocates for Trump's ""secure borders"" and the death penalty.

â— PA-Sen: Republican Rep. Lou Barletta has launched his first ad ahead of the May 15 primary, which the campaign says is a ""six-figure"" buy. It uses a lottery-drawing setup to criticize Democratic Sen. Bob Casey for allegedly collecting $3 million in salary over his career in public office. Barletta claims Casey has no accomplishments, while he points to his own efforts on ""tough immigration reform"" and fighting government spending. The congressman says he'll stand by Trump.

â— WV-Sen: Rep. Evan Jenkins recently launched a 15-second ad for the May 8 GOP primary that attacks state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey for supposedly opposing Trump and backing Clinton, but the spot notably manipulates reality to try to make it look like Morrisey is shaking hands with a cackling Clinton. In truth, Jenkins' team photoshopped a picture of Morrisey shaking hands with Trump in the Oval Office, but one could easily be fooled into thinking he was getting chummy with Clinton when watching the footage.

Meanwhile, Morrisey's latest ad continues to hammer Jenkins for the latter's past as a Democrat. The commercial calls him a ""liberal politician"" who supposedly sided with unpopular national Democrats on issues like guns, coal, and Planned Parenthood. The second half of the ad touts Morrisey's record fighting the Obama administration and his ""A+"" rating from the NRA. However, Jenkins isn't the only one manipulating reality in his ads: Morrisey at one point presents a fake CNN quote that says ""Morrisey stops Obama's illegal amnesty,"" but in reality, the article it references only talks about a Supreme Court case involving 26 GOP state attorneys general and doesn't mention Morrisey at all.

Gubernatorial

â— AL-Gov: On behalf of the Alabama Daily News, a pollster we've never seen before, Leverage Public Strategies, has released a survey of the June 5 GOP primary for governor. Their poll has Gov. Kay Ivey with a huge 47-11 lead over Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle, while evangelical minister Scott Dawson takes 9 percent. That result would put Ivey very close to the outright majority needed to avoid a July 17 runoff entirely. Meanwhile, Battle is up with his first TV ad, which uses a ""There's a battle brewing in Alabama. A battle for ...."" framing ad nauseum to point to the things he's fighting for, like jobs and education.

â— CA-Gov: Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat, will be able to count on some especially well-funded proponents of charter schools to help him overcome Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom's fundraising advantage. A super PAC called Families &amp; Teachers for Antonio Villaraigosa has raised a huge $12.5 million in recent weeks, with large donations from wealthy supporters like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican. The group has reportedly booked $11 million in TV ad time from April 17 to May 21 ahead of the June 5 top-two primary.

Meanwhile, a super PAC called Restore Our Values is supporting wealthy businessman John Cox, a Republican, and it attempts to link both Newsom and Villaraigosa to the #MeToo movement over their old affairs. However, neither of the two Democrats were accused of sexual harassment or assault, which is very different than other politicians who have been brought down by revelations against them over the past several months. Consequently, California voters may take a far more forgiving view of their unseemly past behavior that was nevertheless consensual.

â— CT-Gov: EMILY's List has endorsed former Secretary of State Susan Bysiewicz in her bid for governor. Bysiewicz is the only notable woman running in the Democratic primary, and EMILY, which often supports candidates it's backed in the past, had previously endorsed her unsuccessful 2012 Senate campaign.

â— CO-Gov: Lt. Gov. Donna Lynne is spending $100,000 to debut her first TV ad ahead of the June 26 Democratic primary, and it features something very atypical for a political candidate. The segment shows Lynne getting a new tattoo with the words ""Fight for Colorado"" on her shoulder while she talks about the need to be bold in life. Lynne highlights her accomplishments and ties herself to Gov. John Hickenlooper on efforts to to improve health care.

â— FL-Gov: The National Liberty Foundation, which is funded by the sugar industry, has bought $337,000 worth of TV ad time this week to attack Rep. Ron DeSantis in the Republican primary. There's no copy of any new ad yet, but they have now spent $1.4 million against him.

â— GA-Gov: Tech executive Clay Tippins' latest GOP primary ad bashes Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle for using taxpayer money to charter private jets. It shows a Cagle impersonator wearing a tuxedo throwing out money in stopped traffic while Tippins accuses him of raising taxes to fix Atlanta traffic even though the only one who is getting around easily seems to be Cagle. Tippins argues he's the only non-politician in the race, and he'll fix problems instead of ""flying over"" them.

â— NH-Gov: On Wednesday, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen endorsed former state Sen. Molly Kelly in the Democratic primary for governor, a post Shaheen herself held from 1997 to 2003. Kelly faces former Portsmouth Mayor Steve Marchand for the right to take on first-term GOP Gov. Chris Sununu in the fall.

â— NM-Gov: Rep. Steve Pearce, the presumptive Republican nominee for New Mexico's open gubernatorial race, is hitting the airwaves for the first time. Pearce narrates the ad himself: Standing outside a dilapidated shack, Pearce explains it was his home for the first two years of his lifeâ€”""no plumbing, no running water""â€”and says, ""For too many in our state, things aren't much better."" In the rest of the spot, he speaks in platitudes, saying he wants to ""fix our schools, bring more jobs, stop the crime, and lift families from poverty."" It's a far cryâ€”and a telling oneâ€”from Pearce's usual ultra-conservative rhetoric. According to FCC filings, Pearce is spending $100,000 to run the ad.

â— NY-Gov: Quinnipiac's first poll of the Democratic primary between Gov. Andrew Cuomo and activist Cynthia Nixon finds Cuomo ahead, but he's leading by just a 50-28 margin, which is the closest any pollster has seen the race in the six weeks Nixon's been in it. Here's another way of looking at it: In 2014, when Cuomo was on the receiving end of a challenge from little-known law professor Zephyr Teachout, his smallest lead in the polls was 58-26.

It was also his only lead in the polls, because Teachout's candidacy was given such short shrift that only PPP bothered to survey the race, and even then just once, a few days before the election. That August, Quinnipiac had declared that Teachout was ""about as anonymous as a candidate can be"" and never bothered polling her again. But she took 33 percent to Cuomo's 63, a fairly soft showing for an incumbent with all the money, power, and resources in the world versus a penniless opponent who couldn't even get pollsters to pay attention to her campaign.

Nixon, by contrast, has no problem earning attentionâ€”she knows how to use her celebrity status to ensure plenty of press coverage, and the polls show it's already paying off even though she has yet to spend a cent. It's also worth noting that Cuomo possesses a solid 71-21 favorability rating (and a similar job approval score) among Democrats, but only 50 percent of primary voters say they'll cast a ballot for him. Nixon's favorables, meanwhile, are at 35-15 with Democrats, so she has plenty of room for improvement with those who don't know her yet.

â— OH-Gov: Ohio's supremely nasty GOP primary for governor is less than a week away, and the body language of the two rival camps may offer a clue as to which way the race is headed. In what's likely his final ad, state Attorney General Mike DeWine largely avoids hitting Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, beyond flashing a photo of her at the start as a narrator barks, ""Some people talk. Others deliver."" The rest of the ad, which is running for a reported $900,000, is devoted to talking up DeWine's conservative bona fides, like ""stopping Obama's immigration plan"" and ""fighting for President Trump's travel ban.""

Taylor, on the other hand, continues to hammer her opponent. In her newest ad, she complains that ""D.C. DeWine"" voted to give ""amnesty"" to ""illegals and their drugs,"" and ""allowed dangerous sanctuary cities."" ""Trump and Taylor,"" as the voiceover repeatedly intones, will stop all of these things. If Taylor feels the need to stay negative while DeWine goes, well, what passes for positive these days in a Republican primary, then that suggests both sides believe all the polls showing DeWine ahead.

House

â— CT-05: On Wednesday, high school history teacher Jahana Hayes, who was named national teacher of the year in 2016, joined the race for Connecticut's open 5th District, making her the fourth notable Democrat to do so. Hayes has a remarkable story: Though she grew up in poverty and became pregnant as a teenager, she always ""loved school,"" says the Washington Post, and with the encouragement of her teachers, ultimately graduated from college and achieved her dream of becoming a teacher herself.

After winning teacher of the year honors, she met with Barack Obama at the White House and traveled the country to promote education. Hayes would be the first black woman to represent Connecticut in Congress, and the Hartford Courant says Democrats are ""buzzing"" about her candidacy.

Meanwhile, Middletown Mayor Dan Drew, who briefly considered joining the Democratic primary himself, announced on Tuesday that he would not run.

â— ME-02: A new group called the Maine Outdoor Alliance has paid for at least $149,000 in TV time over the next couple of weeks to air a new ad touting businessman Lucas St. Clair, one of the front-runners in the Democratic primary in the 2nd Congressional District. The minute-long spot features a woman praising St. Clair for helping to revitalize northern Maine through the work he's best known for: brokering a deal to establish the Katahdin National Monument, an 88,000-acre federally protected woodland.

As Michael Shepherd of the Bangor Daily News notes, this is nominally an ""issue ad"" that avoids FEC disclosure requirements by asking viewers at its conclusion to ""[c]all the Trump administration and tell them to leave our Katahdin monument alone,"" rather than openly encouraging them to support St. Clair. It's not clear who's funding the effort, but Shepherd points out that the organization's only officer was the best man at St. Clair's wedding. St. Clair's campaign naturally says it ""has not been involved with the group.""

â— NY-24: Democrat Juanita Perez Williams' petitions withstood scrutiny at a hearing before the state Board of Elections on Tuesday, as supporters of her primary rival, Dana Balter, failed to convince officials to invalidate enough signatures to knock her off the ballot. However, Diane Dwire, the leader of the challenge to Perez Williams' candidacy, suggested that she might continue to pursue the matter in court. If she's unsuccessful, Balter and Perez Williams will face off for the right to take on GOP Rep. John Katko on June 26.

â— PA-07 (old): As expected, Gov. Tom Wolf has ordered the special election for the final two months of former Rep. Pat Meehan's term to take place on Nov. 6, concurrently with Pennsylvania's regularly scheduled general elections. That means there will be simultaneous elections in the old 7th District and its successor, the new 5th. But because the 7th was so infamously gerrymandered, this actually means that voters in six different new districts (including the 5th) will see the special election for the old 7th on their ballots.

Strange as this scenario may seem, we've seen situations like this play out before: In the redistricting year of 2012, it happened in four separate districts. But there's still a question of who's going to run in this race. Pennsylvania doesn't conduct primaries for special elections, so it's likely that party leaders will name the winners of the May 15 primary for the 5th as the nominees for the 7th. However, it's always possible that things could unfold differently, and sometimes, nominees for the regular elections don't want to run in the corresponding special.

That's what went down in Michigan's 11th District six years ago, when GOP Rep. Thad McCotter resigned in humiliating fashion after failing to submit enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. Democrat Syed Taj, who went on to win the nomination for the regular election, declined to run in the special, saying he wanted to focus his efforts on the main race.

Democrats instead put up union leader David Curson for the special, and in an interesting twist, he actually beat Republican Kerry Bentivolio, who'd notoriously lucked into the GOP nomination after McCotter's debacle. Curson went on to spend seven weeks in Congress and even managed to earn some favorable attention from Nancy Pelosi during his brief tenure, after which he retired from politics altogether.

On the very same day Curson won, though, Taj lost to Bentivolio, though it's important to note that the new version of the 11th in which Taj ran was considerably redder than the old one where Curson ran. (Taj, a Muslim immigrant from India, may also have been a victim of racism and religious bigotry: Republicans ran foul attack ads that all but insinuated he was in league with terrorists.)

In Pennsylvania, the script is flipped: The old district is more Republican than the new one, and it's also much more spread out. It's therefore possible that the winner of the Democratic primary for the 5th simply won't want the distraction of also being on the ballot in the 7th. On the other hand, if the same person wins both races, he or she would have a small leg up in seniority among the freshman class in the 116th Congress. In any event, we'll know who's running soon enough.

â— TX-06: A WPA Intelligence poll of the May 22 GOP runoff in Texas' 6th Congressional District conducted for the campaign of former Tarrant County Tax Assessor Ron Wright finds him leading Navy veteran Jake Ellzey by a wide 47-24 margin. That's pretty similar to the 45-22 advantage Wright secured in the March primary. Both candidates, however, had very little money left at the end of the first quarter: Ellzey had just $25,000 on-hand and Wright a mere $9,000.

Legislative

â— Special Elections: Johnny Longtorso has the Tuesday recap:

Florida HD-39: Republicans held this seat, with Josie Tomkow defeating Democrat Ricky Shirah by a 60-40 margin. Florida HD-114: And the Democrats held this one. Javier Fernandez defeated Republican Andrew Vargas by a 51-47 margin. Independent Liz de las Cuevas took the remaining 2 percent.

The Democratic victory in the 114th District was a bigger deal than it might look like. Democrats just barely won it, 51-49, as an open seat in 2016, after the GOP had held it for two terms since it was redrawn in 2012. This part of Miami-Dade County is also historically Republican downballot, and Vargas outspent Fernandez by a wide margin. Amusingly, prominent anti-Trump Republican Ana Navarro lives in the district and declared of the results, ""If u think Trump isn't dragging folks down, I want some of what ur smoking."" Puff puff pass, Ana!

New MPK 21 Office As Social Media Giant Expands Real Estate EmpirePeople write on a chalk board wall at the new Facebook Inc. Frank Gehry-designed MPK 21 office building in Menlo Park, California on Aug. 29, 2018.

SAN FRANCISCO â€” The tech industry is in for a grilling Wednesday when key executives are scheduled to testify before Congress â€” but the companies may be just as worried about the questions they face back home in California.

Outside the political spotlight, tech workers are standing up to their bosses like never before, pressuring them from the inside with demands and pointed questions that upend the typical power dynamic in corporate America.

""I think it took a while for those of us who are computing professionals to lift our heads far enough above what we're doingâ€¦ to look at how our technologies are being applied or misapplied,"" said Cherri M. Pancake, a computer science professor at Oregon State University and president of the Association of Computing Machinery, a trade group that claims a membership of 100,000 tech professionals worldwide at companies including Google.

In recent months, workers at some of the biggest tech companies have mobilized to push their employers to reconsider some projects, particularly those connected to government contracts. Google in June said it would not renew a contract with the U.S. Defense Department to analyze drone footage, after thousands of employees signed a petition and some resigned over the deal.

Employees at Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce have also asked their companies to reconsider government contracts, including with U.S. Customs and Border Protection out of concern their software was helping the Trump administration separate immigrant families or could assist police with facial recognition techniques in violation of people's privacy.

Tech employees are also starting to take matters into their own hands by leaking information to journalists. A letter signed by 1,400 employees has circulate within Google demanding that the company explain why it is exploring a re-entry to the Chinese market with a censored search engine, which came to light after the online investigative journalism outlet The Intercept acquired company documents about the project. The article prompted a defense from CEO Sundar Pichai, who said the product was not close to being launched.



And in March, someone at Facebook leaked a 2016 memo that argued the social media company needed to pursue adding users above all else, leading to a debate within the company over the appropriateness of employee leaks.

The protests demonstrate the potential power of tech workers, and they add up to an unprecedented level of division in Silicon Valley at the same time that regulators, privacy advocates and lawmakers are criticizing the industry from the outside.

""Many employees in the bowels of the machine are increasingly seeing that, if we pull together, we have power, too, and wherever we can, we should voice our opinions,"" said Dipayan Ghosh, a former Facebook employee who's now a fellow at Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.

To guide the activism, the Association for Computing Machinery this year rewrote its code of ethics for the first time since 1992 in order to empower tech workers to raise difficult questions about the purpose of their products with their bosses.

The revised code says that workers ""should take action to avoid creating systems or technologies that disenfranchise or oppress people,"" and that managers should ""take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society,"" like social media.

Pancake said the change was meant to acknowledge the growing concern of tech workers and provide them with guidance and support on how to push their companies to act ethically.

""When you're focused on solving technological problems,"" she continued, ""it's not natural to be thinking, 'How are all the possible ways this could be misused, or tread on someone's privacy, or hurt a certain class of people?'""

Activism's history in tech

The barrage of activism has deep roots in the tech sector, where many engineers have long believed they should pay attention to social good, or even change the world, and not just reward shareholders. Google, for example, has used the motto, ""Don't be evil.""

In 1981, a group of technologists formed Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility ""to question the computerization of war in the United States,"" although it dissolved in 2013, citing declining interest.

""To a much greater degree than outside Silicon Valley, the employees of these companies have a sense of purpose and idealism,"" said Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University.

If you feel like you could get another job somewhere else, it makes it a lot easier to sign your name on a petition.

That idealism is reflected in how some tech companies organize themselves, with casual office cultures and flat hierarchies encouraging a belief that ""we're all in this together,"" said Leslie Berlin, project historian for the Silicon Valley Archives at Stanford University.

Employees are encouraged to give feedback in some contexts. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg takes questions from them weekly. Google runs freewheeling internal message boards, although it released guidelines in June to rein in the debates.

Certain workers â€” top engineers, in particular â€” have strong leverage when speaking out because they know they would be difficult to replace in an industry where companies compete fiercely for talent.

""If you feel like you could get another job somewhere else, it makes it a lot easier to sign your name on a petition,"" Berlin said.

A growing wave

Several factors are contributing to the growing wave of protests, according to current and former employees and industry watchers.

One spark is the Trump administration and in particular its efforts to scale back immigration to the United States. The tech sector relies on engineers who were born abroad, or whose parents were immigrants, for much of its talent, and many of them or their co-workers are angered by the idea of contributing even indirectly to anti-immigration actions.

Another factor is the example set by Susan Fowler, a former engineer at Uber who came forward last year with examples of sexual harassment at the ride-hailing company. Her post was widely shared, leading to the eventual ouster of Uber's CEO and demonstrating the potential power of a single voice.

The most important factor behind tech's unrest, though, may be a growing realization of the power that modern tech companies wield. While a generation ago the biggest players in Silicon Valley may have made semiconductors, today's giants are focused on products for consumers that by definition are more influential in shaping people's day-to-day lives.

In the case of Facebook, ""the company is dealing with a whole range of issues that increasingly are becoming public interest ones: elections, privacy, the security of information, personal autonomy,"" said Ghosh, the former Facebook employee.

When those issues collide with the need to increase profits, he added, ""that's what is really causing all of these tensions to come up.""

Last month, when social media networks were locked in a debate over whether to ban Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist and founder of the website Infowars, some Twitter employees expressed frustration with the company. Twitter limited Jones' ability to tweet for one week in August but has not banned him as Facebook and YouTube have.

Jared Gaut, an engineer at Twitter, said in a tweet last month that he was taking a break after 11 years as a user in protest of the company ""making the wrong decisions."" Without naming the Infowars controversy, Gaut said that Twitter's leadership was ""failing"" its employees by choosing to remain neutral on speech that suppresses others.

Iâ€™ve been a daily user of @twitter for the last 11 years - long before I started working at Twitter. I wonâ€™t be a â€œmonthly active userâ€ during the rest of Q3. Iâ€™m deleting the @twitter app from all my devices and signing out of all browsers. @jack, thread â€” jared. (@jaredgaut) August 14, 201 Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who is scheduled to testify before Congress on Wednesday, told NBC News last month that the company ""can't build a service that is subjective just to the whims of what we personally believe."" He has also publicly thanked employees on Twitter for speaking up.

Activism's limits

Roger McNamee, the managing director at Elevation Partners, a venture capital firm, said he believes there's been a narrow range of subjects that tech employees have been willing to sign petitions over.

While the recent protests at Google have targeted defense contracts and Chinese censorship, McNamee said they have not addressed other ways the company affects society. YouTube, owned by Google and its parent company Alphabet, has been criticized, for instance, for recommending extreme videos to viewers.

""The issues they picked to protest are surprising,"" McNamee said. ""I wish the employees at Alphabet would protest YouTube's role as a platform for recruiting and training extremists. I wish they would protest the way YouTube's recommendation engine favors conspiracy theories.""

McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who still owns shares in the social network, is an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit made up of former tech workers concerned about smartphone addiction and other social effects of technology.

In response to such criticism, YouTube has been tweaking its service to show users what it calls ""more authoritative"" news sources.

Pancake, of the Association for Computing Machinery, said there's no guarantee tech companies will learn from their mistakes, but she thinks more programmers are learning to speak up to their bosses â€” and in public.

""What I think we need to do,"" she said, ""is expose more and more of these breaches to public scrutiny.""

3ZC62PVYDISXSRATU24GIUN2IG8XX6,Pope to Immigrants: the Good Samaritan Did Not Ask for â€˜Documentsâ€™,"At his â€œMass for Migrantsâ€ in the Vatican Friday, Pope Francis called for an international response of â€œsolidarity and mercyâ€ to the ongoing immigration crisis.

Marking the fifth anniversary of his visit to the Italian island of Lampedusa to meet with migrants in 2013, the pope addressed both migrants and rescuers in his homily at the Mass, comparing the latter to modern-day Good Samaritans.

â€œI thank the rescuers for embodying in our day the parable of the Good Samaritan, who stopped to save the life of the poor man beaten by bandits,â€ Francis said. â€œHe didnâ€™t ask where he was from, his reasons for travelling or his documentsâ€¦ he simply decided to care for him and save his life.â€

The pope promised his â€œsolidarity and encouragementâ€ with migrants, asking them to be â€œwitnesses of hope in a world increasingly concerned about the present, with little vision for the future and averse to sharing.â€

â€œWith respect for the culture and laws of the country that receives you, may you work out together the path of integration,â€ he said.

The pontiff also had strong words for those who fail to open their doors to migrants, comparing them to the oppressed poor of the Old Testament who were â€œtrampled on.â€

Italian Church Faces Growing Divide Between Prelates and People over Immigration https://t.co/PAlcFcmkGT via @BreitbartNews â€” Thomas D. Williams (@tdwilliamsrome) July 4, 2018

â€œHow many of the poor are trampled on in our day!â€ he said. â€œAmong them, I cannot fail to include the migrants and refugees who continue to knock at the door of nations that enjoy greater prosperity.â€

Recalling the many migrants who have lost their lives in recent years attempting the perilous crossing of the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa to Europe, Francis repeated Godâ€™s words to Cain in the book of Genesis: â€œWhere is your brother? His blood cries out to me.â€

â€œSadly, the response to this appeal, even if at times generous, has not been enough, and we continue to grieve thousands of deaths,â€ he said.

The popeâ€™s words come in the midst of recent debates over the role of NGOs providing a â€œshuttle serviceâ€ to migrants from Africa to Europe. Some, including Frontex, the European border control agency, have suggested that the â€œpull factorâ€ from the availability of this service has emboldened human traffickers and increased the risk of migrant deaths at sea.

And while we're at itâ€¦ https://t.co/kVFLY8p9Dj via @BreitbartNews â€” Thomas D. Williams (@tdwilliamsrome) July 4, 2018

In a 64-page report released in 2017, Frontex suggested that NGOs have become accomplices to people smugglers by providing a reliable taxi service for migrants from Africa to Europe, lowering smugglersâ€™ costs and improving their â€œbusiness model.â€

â€œMigrants and refugees â€“ encouraged by the stories of those who had successfully made it in the past â€“ attempt the dangerous crossing since they are aware of and rely on humanitarian assistance to reach the EU,â€ the report states.

Ironically, the encouragement of risky behavior through NGO services and Europeâ€™s open-door policy to migration has contributed in a major way to the tremendous loss of life in the Mediterranean.

Returning in his homily to the parable of the Good Samaritan, the pope said that many are tempted today to look the other way rather than dirtying their hands to help their neighbors in need.

This temptation â€œtakes the form of closing our hearts to those who have the right, just as we do, to security and dignified living conditions. It builds walls, real or virtual, rather than bridges,â€ he said.

â€œBefore the challenges of contemporary movements of migration, the only reasonable response is one of solidarity and mercy,â€ Francis continued. â€œA response less concerned with calculations, than with the need for an equitable distribution of responsibilities, an honest and sincere assessment of the alternatives and a prudent management.â€

The pope recognized that a just immigration is â€œconcerned for the good of oneâ€™s own country,â€ while also â€œtaking into account that of others in an ever more interconnected world.â€

3IQ9O0AYW7HTLFCEQ63IQHFHHV2IT6,Mollie Tibbetts Is Americaâ€™s Call to Action on Open Borders,"America has been shocked and saddened by the murder of Mollie Tibbetts, but how long will it last? If the pattern of our modern media culture holds, the story will linger perhaps a week and then fade into the background in favor of the latest political scandal.

Instead, the story should be treated for what it is, a clarion call to finally repair our nationâ€™s disastrous immigration system.

For many years now, this has been more than just a border state problem. Even in the rural communities of Iowa, our children are not safe to jog in broad daylight. There are many complexities to the immigration problem, but this much is simple and certain: our borders must be secured, and we must be able to properly identify all who enter this country. And yet, there is massive resistance to both of those goals.

Local police have stated that Mollieâ€™s alleged killer, Cristhian Rivera, has been living illegally in the country for at least four years. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) later confirmed that Rivera did not make any DACA requests and the agency could find no record that Rivera has any lawful immigration status. Being Mexican, he most likely entered from our southern border, which federal agents have been warning for years is wide open to unauthorized entry. While a border wall would not guarantee a complete end to illegal border crossings, it would squeeze the flow of illegal aliens into smaller areas where U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents can more effectively apprehend them. Any proposal for immigration reform that does not include a border wall should be a nonstarter.

Beyond his illegal status, we have learned that Rivera was an employee at a farm and that the employer did not vet him through the E-Verify system. It appears that Rivera obtained a fraudulent identity to hide his illegal status, a practice that has become routine among the community of aliens who have largely operated one step ahead of the law. If Americans are to be safe in their communities, this black market of deceit cannot be allowed to continue. The good news is that there are clear steps our government can take to close the loopholes,

E-Verify is an important component of the vetting process, but it needs certain conditions to be truly effective. It has become common knowledge that stealing someone elseâ€™s identity is a way to cheat E-Verify under the current system. The Obama administration stopped the process of sending out â€œno matchâ€ letters to employees when Social Security numbers provided by applicants did not match the governmentâ€™s database records. The government cited high costs as the reason for the move, but raising these red flags is essential to ending the underground business of identity theft that has become a by-product of illegal entry into the country.

Similarly, USCIS has encouraged states to share driverâ€™s license photos to decrease identity fraud. Currently, ten states share this information, but the others do not. This practice is another weapon in our effort and should be mandatory.

In opposing these common sense solutions, the anti-borders coalition attempts to muddy the waters with a hodge-podge of faulty arguments. Among them is the claim that illegal aliens commit crimes at a lower rate than U.S. citizens. The response to this nonsensical, red herring of a claim should be, how many murders of innocent people by illegal aliens should we accept? Is ten too many? How about 200, or 2,000? When someone is murdered, whether by a U.S. citizen or an illegal alien, the damage done to the victimâ€™s family is incalculable. Knowing that the killer was here illegally and should never have been in country only adds to the familyâ€™s pain. The same people who cried with empathy for the children who were temporarily separated from their parents at the border seem coldly indifferent to the children who were not only permanently separated from their families, but their lives.

Beyond the murderers themselves, it is clear who bears responsibility for creating the circumstances for these crimes to occur. It is the politicians who advocate for open borders and sanctuary policies, as well as like-minded media outlets that manipulate the truth about the issues while demonizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and others on the side of order and security. Until the American people refuse to stand for this twisted status quo, Mollie Tibbettsâ€™s name will join a long list of others including Kate Steinle, Drew Rosenberg, and Edwin Jackson as collateral damage on the journey to a lawless, borderless United States.

(Aug. 22) AP

Correction &amp; Clarification: A previous version of this story stated that the federal government sent only Japanese immigrants to internment camps during World War II. Most held were Japanese-Americans who were U.S. citizens.

Dane Lang, a co-owner of Yarrabee Farms outside of Brooklyn, Iowa, stood outside his family farm this week and lamented that he had employed the undocumented immigrant charged in the slaying of 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts.

Then he was asked if any other non-U.S. citizens were among the 10 employees on the dairy farm.

""I don't think I can comment to that,"" Lang said.

That vague answer highlights the worst-kept secret in the agriculture business: Roughly half of the nation's 1.4 million field workers (47 percent, or 685,000 workers) are undocumented immigrants. And that estimate, from the Labor Department, is a conservative one, with labor experts citing far higher percentages.

While presidents have approached undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. in vastly different ways, Republicans and Democratic administrations â€“ under heavy lobbying from the agricultural industry â€“ have always treated undocumented farm workers differently.

While the federal government was herding more than 100,000 people of Japanese descent into internment camps during World War II, it was also administering the Bracero Program, which allowed millions of Mexicans to enter the U.S. to work on farms.

When President Ronald Reagan signed a landmark immigration law in 1986 that granted amnesty to nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants, those who worked on farms were given the easiest path to U.S. citizenship.

A bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate (but not the House) in 2013 would have created a special ""blue card"" just for agricultural workers and their immediate families that granted them legal status and the chance to become U.S. citizens.

And now, many Republicans are citing Tibbetts' death as a reason to pass a bill requiring all U.S. companies to use the federal E-Verify system to check the immigration status of all job applicants. But even that bill â€“ the Legal Workforce Act filed by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas â€“ gives farmers 2.5 years before they must start vetting their field workers, the only such exception.

Chris Chmielenski, deputy director of NumbersUSA, a group that advocates for lower levels of legal and illegal immigration, said that history reflects both the power of the agricultural industry and the willingness of politicians to help them out.

He says the easiest solution would be to require that all U.S. business use E-Verify, which allows employers to check the immigration status of job applicants using a government website. The Iowa farm that employed Cristhian Bahena Rivera, who is charged with first-degree murder in Tibbetts' death, initially said they used that program to screen Rivera but later backtracked and conceded that they had used a different system not designed to flag immigration violations.

""That would have a pretty big impact on future flows of illegal immigration,"" Chmielenski said.

But farmers, ranchers and other business owners who rely on undocumented immigrants say passing an E-Verify bill would cripple their industries. Already struggling to recruit enough Americans to do the back-breaking field work, and operating under the constant threat of raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, they say implementing E-Verify with no other changes to the immigration system would put untold numbers of companies out of business.

That's why the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said that it would only support mandatory electronic worker verification if it's coupled with an overhaul, and expansion, of the country's guest-worker programs. The American Farm Bureau Federation goes a step further, arguing that passing E-Verify alone would cause production to drop by $60 billion and food prices to increase by 5 percent to 6 percent.

""Farmers and ranchers get that we have immigration laws in our country, and they want nothing more than to be able to attain their workers legally,"" said John-Walt Boatright, the national affairs coordinator for the Florida Farm Bureau. ""But we cannot have E-Verify without a workable, functioning, accessible guest-work program in place.""

Farmers across the country saw exactly what would happen if the government took an enforcement-only approach after Arizona passed an anti-immigration bill in 2010, leading a half-dozen states to follow suit. The laws, which included the requirement that all businesses use the E-Verify system, sent undocumented immigrants out of those states in droves.

Alabama's immigration law pushed up to 80,000 workers out of the state, according to a study conducted by the University of Alabama.

Georgia's immigration law led to more than $140 million in unharvested crops in 2011 because so many workers fled the state, according to a report commissioned by the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association.

The fleeing workers in Arizona resulted in an average 2 percent drop in the state's gross domestic product every year through 2015, according to an analysis conducted by The Wall Street Journal.

Finding American workers to make up for the shortfall was just as difficult. In Georgia, Gov. Republican Nathan Deal turned to people on probation in 2011, but most walked off the jobs almost immediately.

That same year in North Carolina, as 489,000 people were unemployed statewide, the North Carolina Growers Association listed 6,500 available jobs, but just 268 North Carolinians applied, 163 showed up for work, and only seven finished the season, according to a study by the Partnership for a New American Economy.

The solution, according to farmers, is a nationwide guest-worker program that improves on the current H2A visa program that has been a headache for farmers for decades.

Those visas are designed for temporary, seasonal workers and have been used more frequently in recent years. The number of H2A visas approved has increased from 74,192 in 2013 to 161,583 in 2017, according to State Department data.

""That doesn't mean it's a great program,"" he said. ""It just means it's the only program.""

Boatright said the H2A program is too rigid to accommodate the unpredictable timing of harvests. He said it's overloaded with too many regulations that often require farms to have immigration attorneys on staff just to fill out paperwork. And because the visas cannot be used for year-round workers, Boatright said it makes dairies, nurseries and livestock ranches ineligible.

Chmielenski said his organization, which can successfully pressure Washington by activating its network of thousands of supporters to flood congressional offices with calls, emails and tweets, is willing to consider a tandem bill that includes mandatory E-Verify with improvements to the agricultural guest-worker program. And that, in the end, may be the only way to get a bill through Congress.

""We acknowledge the fact that H2A could be cleaned up,"" he said. ""We're willing to work with them on that and to give them a pool of foreign workers they can tap into when there's not an American worker willing to do that for a decent wage.""

â€œMy deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain,â€ he wrote on Twitter on Saturday night. â€œOur hearts and prayers are with you!â€

The president reacted quickly in response to the news despite a history of criticism between the two Republicans.

My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 26, 2018

Trump remained furious with McCain after the veteran senator killed a final Senate effort to repeal Obamacare in the summer of 2017 by voting no in an early morning vote.

Although not mentioning McCain by name, Trump has spent months blaming him for ruining the Republican effort to end Obamacare, despite his battle with cancer.

When it looked like McCain would support the 2017 effort, Trump praised him for returning to vote for an Obamacare repeal.

So great that John McCain is coming back to vote. Brave â€“ American hero! Thank you John. â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017

The pair famously tangled in 2015, when McCain called Trumpâ€™s 15,000 supporters who appeared for a rally in Phoenix as â€œcraziesâ€ and criticized his rhetoric on immigration.

â€œThis performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me,â€ McCain said in an interview with the New Yorker. â€œBecause what he did was he fired up the crazies.â€

Trump responded by calling McCain a â€œdummy.â€

Developing now, Tuesday, June 26, 2018

The South Carolina GOP gubernatorial runoff will be the focus as voters will decide primary contests in seven states Tuesday

Democrats reportedly worry that calls to publicly shame Trump administration officials will hurt them at the polls and possibly the November midterm elections

The Justice Department refused House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes's request for more information about the FBI's use of alleged informants in 'spygate'

The Trump administration has temporarily scaled back a key element of its 'zero tolerance' immigration policy amid backlash over the separation of children from their illegal immigrant families

FOX News has learned the identity of the Congressional intern who cursed at President Trump on Capitol Hill last week - and that the intern will not be fired

THE LEAD STORY - ALL EYES ON THE PALMETTO STATE: President Trump is not on the ballot, but he has invested time, energy and political capital in a slate of primary contests across America that will again test his clout within his own party. Voters will have their say in seven states Tuesday, but the contest that matters most to Trump is South Carolina, where he appeared at a rally Monday to help Gov. Henry McMaster hours before polls opened ... The Republican governor, one of Trump's first high-profile supporters, is fighting for his political life against self-made millionaire John Warren in a runoff election ... The South Carolina gubernatorial race headlined the latest in a series of primary contests that stretched across New York, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Maryland and Mississippi on Tuesday. With the November general election nearly four months away, more than half of all states will have selected their general-election candidates after Tuesday's votes are counted.

'AUNTIE MAXINE' BACKFIRING ON DEMS? - Some Democrats are reportedly concerned that public appeals to â€œabsolutely harassâ€ Trump administration officials will come back to hurt them in the polls and benefit Republicans ... There have been several recent instances where Trump officials have been publicly shamed, including Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen at a Mexican restaurant and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who was asked to leave by an owner of a restaurant in Virginia. The Washington Postâ€™s editorial board wrote a column titled, â€œLet the Trump team eat in peace.â€ The paper identified the heightened state of â€œpassionsâ€ in the country, but saw no benefit in protesters interrupting dinners.

Democrats warned that these public encounters could win sympathy for the Trump administration, The Los Angeles Times reported. Rep. Maxine Waters, in the meantime, is not backing down from her weekend comments calling for people to confront members of the Trump administration at gas stations and anywhere else they're seen in public.

FBI CLAIMS CONFIDENTIALITY: The Justice Department on Monday declined to answer requests by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., for more information about the reported use of FBI informants while investigating President Trump's 2016 campaign ... Nunes had given Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein until 5 p.m. ET to say whether the FBI had used ""informants against members or associates of the Trump campaign and if so, how many informants were used and how much money was spent on their activities?"" In his response to Nunes, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said: ""Many of your requests relate to documents and information regarding issues surrounding confidential human sources that are solely in the custody and control of the FBI.""

SLIGHT, TEMPORARY SHIFT IN 'ZERO-TOLERANCE': The Trump administration has temporarily halted the practice of turning over parents to prosecutors for charges of illegally entering the country, scaling back a key part of its ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy amid the controversy over separating children from their illegal immigrant families at the border ... Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said Monday that President Trump's executive order last week to stop splitting immigrant families at the border required a temporary halt to prosecuting parents and guardians, unless they had criminal history or the child's welfare was in question. He insisted the White House's zero tolerance policy toward illegal entry remained intact.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders acknowledged the policy shift, but attributed it to the government resources being stretched thin. â€œWeâ€™re not changing the policy. Weâ€™re simply out of resources,â€ she said.

F-BOMBER REVEALED: The Congressional intern who hollered â€œMr. President, f--- you!â€ across the Capitol Rotunda last week during a presidential visit has been identified ... Sources tell Fox News the woman in question is 21-year-old Caitlin Marriott, who is interning in the office of Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H. Fox News is told Marriott has not been terminated and will continue to work there through August. FOX News learned she received a week-long suspension and will be confined to her duties in Hassan's office.

John McCain, who died Saturday at 81, will be remembered as many things â€“ father, former prisoner of war, U.S. senator, presidential nominee â€“ but perhaps his most enduring legacy is captured in a single word: maverick.

But how did the Arizona Republican earn the label that has come to define his rise in national politics? Weâ€™ve rounded up some of his most memorable moments in which he showed he was not afraid to stand up for what he believed in.

Refusing early release as a POW in Vietnam

In 1967, the aircraft McCain was piloting was shot down over North Vietnam. He was captured and spent more than five years as a prisoner of war. McCain, the son and grandson of Navy admirals, had the opportunity to be released early. He refused because he wanted to follow the military code of conduct which instructed POWs to accept release only in the order in which they were captured.

Challenging Republicans on issues that mattered to him

McCain was a conservative Republican, but his work in the Senate was marked by a zest for bipartisanship which often put him at odds with his own party. McCain reached across the aisle on several occasions to push for action on issues like campaign finance reform, climate change and immigration.

In 2002, he co-authored a campaign finance law with Democrat Russ Feingold, but the Supreme Court rolled back key parts of the law.

More: What will Sen. John McCain's legacy be?

The following year, he worked with Joe Lieberman, a former Democratic senator from Connecticut, to introduce a climate change bill designed to cut and cap greenhouse gas pollution, although the bill did not pass in the Senate.

He also worked for more than a decade trying to forge a bipartisan deal on immigration reform that would include stricter border security combined with a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants. Legislation he helped write in 2013 passed the Senate, but it was never taken up by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

Defending Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign

During the 2008 presidential race, McCain spoke out in defense of Barack Obama when a woman at a town hall event said she could not trust him because he was ""an Arab.""

""No, ma'am. He's a decent, family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues. And that's what this campaign is all about,"" McCain said, as the crowd booed. â€œI admire Senator Obama and his accomplishments, and I will respect him. I want everyone to be respectful, and letâ€™s make sure we are. Because thatâ€™s the way politics should be conducted in America.""

When Obama defeated him in November 2008, McCain gave a powerful concession speech acknowledging the historic significance of the Democratic candidate's victory, particularly for African Americans.

â€œThis is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight. Iâ€™ve always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. Senator Obama believes that, too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nationâ€™s reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound.â€

Taking on Trump

Though they shared a party affiliation, McCain and Trump battled publicly almost from the time the real estate mogul launched his presidential bid in the summer 2015. McCain eventually withdrew his endorsement of Trump in October 2016 after an audio recording surfaced of Trump making lewd comments about women.

He publicly took Trump to task after the then-presidential candidate feuded with Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier killed in Iraq. McCain also criticized â€œspurious nationalismâ€ in an apparent knock on Trumpâ€™s â€˜America Firstâ€™ policy.

More: Trump warns McCain. 'At some point, I fight back. And it won't be pretty'

Speaking out on harsh interrogations

McCain, who was tortured during his time as a POW in Vietnam, was a vocal critic of the CIA's past use of harsh interrogation methods of suspected terrorists. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he opposed Gina Haspel's nomination for CIA director, saying she failed to adequately answer questions about her role in the now-outlawed harsh interrogations program.

In 2015, he spoke about the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on CIA interrogation tactics:

â€œI believe the American people have a right â€“ indeed, a responsibility â€“ to know what was done in their name; how these practices did or did not serve our interests; and how they comported with our most important values... The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow. It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us. But the American people are entitled to it, nonetheless.""

Preserving the Affordable Care Act, Obama's legacy

In the early hours of July 28, 2017, McCain shocked the country when he gave a dramatic thumbs-down to GOP legislation to undo the Affordable Care Act, casting a decisive vote that stalled Republican efforts to gut Obamacare.

McCain delivered a passionate speech on the Senate floor prior to casting his vote urging his fellow senators to return to the civility and camaraderie for which the upper chamber once was known. His vote came just a week after he learned that he had a brain tumor.

3QO7EE372P566R6G3SH6ZP0H2YJBQC,Rauner vetoes bills on immigration,"Gov. Bruce Rauner vetoed a measure Friday that would encourage immigrants' cooperation with police investigations by offering protection from deportation, one of three immigrant-related bills the Republican nixed in a week of rising tensions over national policy because of the death of an Iowa college student, allegedly at the hands of an immigrant.

Rauner rejected the plan to push police into speedier approval of protective visas . He said its ""aggressive timeline"" was too burdensome and carries penalties that are too harsh.

Immigrants who face deportation if discovered are eligible for the visas allowing them to seek federal protection if they are victims of specified crimes and cooperate with criminal investigations. But immigrants' advocates say police often ignore the requests for help.

""This is a slap in the face to crime victims who happen to be immigrants,"" the bill's sponsor, Senate President John Cullerton, a Chicago Democrat, said in a statement. ""The whole idea was to foster trust between police and immigrant communities.""

It was one of three immigrant-related pieces of legislation to meet with a veto In a week of increasing attention on immigration. A man suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, Cristhian Bahena Rivera, was charged in the abduction and stabbing death of 20-year-old college student Mollie Tibbetts in Iowa. It's prompted President Donald Trump to rail against the nation's immigration system.

Rauner said police don't have the resources to verify crime-victim claims and face significant backlash if they err.

""Requiring certification within a tight timeline, but also subjecting law enforcement to perjury if a mistake is made, is an unacceptably risky position to put law enforcement in,"" Rauner said.

Rauner approved two immigrant-related measures, including Cullerton's legislation to bar the state from spending money on or sharing demographic information with any agency creating a registry based on religion, national origin, disability, or other categorical characterizations. Trump inspired that idea when he suggested as a candidate in 2016 that Muslims should register with the government. He has backed off the idea.

Rauner also signed a law to allow professional licenses to be awarded regardless of immigrant or citizenship status. That makes it easier for those in the country legally because they were brought here as youngsters under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals rule to get licenses they've earned to be a pharmacist or barber.

But Rauner turned thumbs down on two other proposals. One would make ""safe zones"" of public buildings such as schools, state-funded health centers, courts and libraries off limits to immigration-law enforcement. And he nixed a proposal to bar landlords from evicting or reporting tenants based on immigration status.

""The governor is trying to score political points during a week when anti-immigrant rhetoric is high,"" said Sen. Iris Martinez, a Chicago Democrat who co-sponsored the tenant bill, but also sponsored the professional licenses plan. ""It's a shame that he cares more about appealing to certain voters than really reading this legislation and understanding that it is beneficial to the many immigrants living in our state.""

Rauner said in veto messages that the proposals would violate federal law prohibting anyone from refusing to disclose to the government information about any person's citizenship or immigration status.

""Illinois continues to be a welcoming state for all and continuously strives to protect the rights of all residents,"" Rauner said. ""However, we must comply (with) federal law.""

32K26U12DO6RQW0H3N2M02NPMECDVN,Violent 'F--- Trump' image removed by Portland art gallery after backlash,"An anti-Trump Portland art gallery reportedly took down a graphic window display showing the president with a bloody nose and a knife to his throat alongside the words â€œF--- Trump.â€

The One Grand art galleryâ€™s founder told FOX 12 heâ€™s taking the controversial image down because people were responding to it with â€œsuch anger and violenceâ€ -- and at the request of his landlord.

AFTER COMPLAINTS, SCHOOLâ€™S MURAL SHOWING TRUMPâ€™S HEAD ON SPEAR ORDERED COVERED

â€œThe same people offended over a â€˜death threatâ€™ are the same people upholding death threats &amp; violence. Irony,â€ the One Grand Gallery had written in a since-deleted Facebook post.

While the image was removed from the window facing the public street, the same depiction hangs on the wall of the gallery alongside other anti-Trump pieces featured in an exhibit called â€œF--- You Mr. President.â€ The show is open until Aug. 10, according to the galleryâ€™s Instagram.

Upset users on social media called the anti-Trump image â€œclassless,â€ â€œshamelessâ€ and â€œtotally disgusting.â€

The gruesome image is reminiscent of when comic Kathy Griffin sparked a backlash in 2016 for posing for a photo of her holding a bloodied Trump mask in a stance similar to a terrorist beheading someone. The incident sparked a federal investigation.

Portland police say they have not received any official complaints, and a U.S. Secret Service spokesman said the agency is aware of the galleryâ€™s depiction of the president but does not comment further about possible investigations.

Prints of Trumpâ€™s face were also sold at the gallery, with profits split equally between Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, and the National Immigration Law Center, according to an Instagram post.",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/07/18/violent-f-trump-image-removed-by-portland-art-gallery-after-backlash.html,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Republican', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral']","['1', '1', '3', '1', '1']"
33N1S8XHHN3E7LPFOR7UK6ZCLNRZ1L,Obama: Abolish the Nation-State!,"Former President Barack Obama told an African audience that votersâ€™ preferences for their own nation are no excuse for keeping nation-states and that all governments should welcome migrants who are â€œstriving for a better life.â€

Obama hid his radical globalist call for ending the 200-year old dominance of nation-states under his signature style of passive-aggressive rhetoric, saying:

In the Westâ€™s current debate around immigration, for example, itâ€™s not wrong to insist that national borders matter; whether youâ€™re a citizen or not is going to matter to a government, that laws need to be followed; that in the public realm newcomers should make an effort to adapt to the language and customs of their new home. Those are legitimate things and we have to be able to engage people who do feel as if things are not orderly.

But those public priorities â€œcanâ€™t be an excuse for immigration policies based on race, or ethnicity, or religion,â€ he said a July 17 speech in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Instead, national immigration laws should be subordinate to the claim that all humans share an â€œessential humanity â€¦ [of] striving for a better life,â€ who are to be viewed as just like â€œanybody in our family,â€ he said:

We can enforce the law while respecting the essential humanity of those who are striving for a better life. For a mother with a child in her arms, we can recognize that could be somebody in our family, that could be my child.

Obamaâ€™s passive-aggressive demand is that immigration policies can only be legitimate if they reject any claim that a nation belongs to its ethnic group â€” for example, that Hungary belongs to Hungarians, or America belongs to Americans.

In his speech, Obama also demanded that race be excluded from policy calculations. But race is already peripheral to nationalism and the nation-state. Dutch nationalists donâ€™t argue that blacks cannot be Dutch because they are black â€” they argue that Holland should be for the Dutch because that is where the Dutch live. Similarly, Irish nationalists fought the English regardless of their shared white racial background.

Obama is also demanding that religion be excluded from immigration policies. If his preference were implemented, Westerners would not be allowed to exclude Islamic believers from their societies which are based on Christian ideas and practices, and the Saudi government could not exclude San Francisco liberals. Arab Muslims, for example, are who â€œstriving for a better lifeâ€ would be regarded as equally legitimate members of Norwegian society because officials must disregard cultural differences buried under ethnic and religious differences.

For Obama, cultural and religious differences are either superficial or a fraud. â€œWe are all human â€¦ our differences are superficial,â€ insisted Obama, lumping together Swedes and Yemenis, Chinese and Somalis, Americans and Koreans. â€œIt is a truth that lies at the heart of every world religion â€“ that we should do unto others as we would have them do unto us,â€ he said, ignoring Islamâ€™s commandment for believers to hate non-Muslims.

Obama dismissed the evidence that some cultures are better than others:

Embracing our common humanity does not mean that we have to abandon our unique ethnic and national and religious identities â€¦ you can be proud of your heritage without denigrating those of a different heritage. (Applause.) In fact, you dishonor your heritage. It would make me think that youâ€™re a little insecure about your heritage if youâ€™ve got to put somebody elseâ€™s heritage down.

But Obama pivoted to warn that war is inevitable if his anti-nationalist policies are not adopted:

The fact that countries which rely on rabid nationalism and xenophobia and doctrines of tribal, racial or religious superiority as their main organizing principle, the thing that holds people together â€“ eventually those countries find themselves consumed by civil war or external war. Check the history books.

Obama also slammed the international business groups which he empowered by promoting easy migration during his term as president:

In their business dealings, many titans of industry and finance are increasingly detached from any single locale or nation-state, and they live lives more and more insulated from the struggles of ordinary people in their countries of origin. (Applause.) And their decisions â€“ their decisions to shut down a manufacturing plant, or to try to minimize their tax bill by shifting profits to a tax haven with the help of high-priced accountants or lawyers, or their decision to take advantage of lower-cost immigrant labor, or their decision to pay a bribe â€“ are often done without malice; itâ€™s just a rational response, they consider, to the demands of their balance sheets and their shareholders and competitive pressures.

Instead of the populist or business groups, Obama pushed for rule by college-graduate political activists, such as himself:

for those of us who care about the legacy that we honor here today â€“ about equality and dignity and democracy and solidarity and kindness, those of us who remain young at heart, if not in body â€“ we have an obligation to help our youth succeed. Some of you know, here in South Africa, my Foundation is convening over the last few days, two hundred young people from across this continent who are doing the hard work of making change in their communities; who reflect Madibaâ€™s values, who are poised to lead the way.

Obama pushed this anti-national globalist pitch throughout his presidency. But Obama hid his pitch for globalism under his passive-aggressive style, allowing most media outlets to simply ignore Obamaâ€™s radical priorities. In November 2015, for example, he argued:

Part of whatâ€™s wonderful about America is also what makes our democracy hard sometimes, because sometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently. And that, sometimes, has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration. If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, well, I donâ€™t want those folks. Even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans.

But Obamaâ€™s anti-national, globalist priorities have had huge political effects. For example, Obamaâ€™s lowered the barrier to migrants from the south, prompting roughly half a million migrants from Central American to move into Americansâ€™ blue-collar jobs, neighborhoods, and schools.

In 2013, Obama pushed the radical 2013 cheap-labor-and-amnesty bill. The amnesty would have given away 30 million green-cards in 10 years and shifted annual income to Wall Street investors, but it was blocked in 2014 by GOP primary votes. That amnesty fight helped the Democrats lose nine Senate seats in 2014, and also launched Donald Trump on his path to the presidency.",https://www.breitbart.com/economics/2018/07/17/obama-abolish-the-nation-state/,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Republican', 'Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Democratic']","['5', '5', '3', '5', '3']"
3YCT0L9OMNRKKGAQYMBKLKFC1NWNS4,Prepping US workers for new skills,"Amid the controversies swirling around the White House, you might have missed President Trump's launch of an initiative on workforce development. His actions flag the need to address serious problems the US economy and America's workers face: growing skills shortages, an increasing gap between unfilled jobs and workers to fill them, and solutions for the expected effects of rapid technological changes on future jobs and workplaces.

The United States and most other countries are poorly prepared to handle the waves of new technology, which some call Industry 4.0. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that as many as 375 million workers worldwide may need to change jobs or learn new skills by 2030 because of technological changes.

The anticipated challenges, in addition to a globalized economy and the rise of China, has left many American workers sidelined and left behind. Political leaders have fallen far short of providing solutions while the marketplace has failed to offer good alternatives for millions of workers and many communities hit by plant closures and industry moves.

Recommended: In good times, safety net for the jobless frays

At the same time, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, there are not enough unemployed workers in the current labor pool to match demand. Some 6.6 million jobs are currently unfilled. Even before this, 45 percent of employers told a Manpower survey that they struggled to fill job vacancies. There is a big mismatch between work and workers in the economy.

Mr. Trump's move is a welcome response to these issues. He signed an executive order creating a National Council for the American Worker made up of senior officials charged with developing better training and retraining of workers for high-demand industries. The council will be aided by an advisory board to help craft ideas for improving such opportunities for workers.

The president also launched an initiative in which companies, business associations, and others pledge to generate and implement job-training programs that produce results. And the council and its advisory board will also focus on ways to better connect business, workers, and educational institutions.

These efforts should link up with other steps needed to bolster the economy, such as investment in education, research, and critical infrastructure. The president and others should also push Congress to reform the system to permit more immigrants who can bring special skills and talents needed in the economy.

The success of Trump's proposals will depend on funding and implementing them, and how well they are linked to initiatives already under way in various US states and cities.

The US can also learn from best practices in other countries. This year, the Group of 20 - representing the world's 20 largest economies - and the smaller Group of Seven both focused on preparing for jobs of the future. And a Wilson Center report called for coordination across North America. Canada and Mexico are the two largest partners of the US for building things together.

As the Fourth Industrial Revolution sweeps through world markets, learning from others and sharing best practices is essential. America should lead the way by ensuring its workers are up to the tasks of the 21st century.

But the Commercial Appeal reports that the Shelby County Sheriff's Office is still cooperating in other ways with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In April, the county attorney's office ruled ICE's 48-hour detainer requests likely violated the U.S. Constitution.

Sheriff's policy adviser Debra Fessenden says ICE is still notified whenever a non-citizen is booked into the jail. The immigration agency is allowed to make arrests at the facility, and can be notified of suspects' release times.

A Tennessee law mandating compliance with ICE detainer requests goes into effect next year. It's unclear how that will affect Shelby County's policy.

Nathan Rousseau Smith has the story. Buzz60

White people are being outed on social media for racially profiling black people. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images)

SAN FRANCISCO â€“ It's now a weekly, if not daily, occurrence: A video is posted on Facebook or Twitter showing a white person calling police on black people for minor violations or nothing at all, a new form of social media shaming that's exposed the everyday racism black Americans face and brought swift repercussions for the perpetrators.

Tagged with nicknames such as BBQ Becky and Permit Patty, white people who've reported black people for sitting in Starbucks, shopping at CVS, mowing lawns, playing golf, staying at an Airbnb or napping on a couch in a college dorm, are being publicly named, mocked and, in some cases, fired from their jobs.

White people have been policing black behavior for a long time. If they think someone black seems out of place, they know they can say something to the property manager, a store supervisor or the police, sociologists who study race say. Many black people in these situations don't bother to complain publicly. They say they're unlikely to be believed or their concerns will be dismissed. And they don't want to escalate the situation and end up in jail or worse.

Now footage captured on smartphones and spread instantly on social media is shining the spotlight on how black people are singled out ""simply because they are black,"" says George Yancy, a professor of philosophy at Emory University and author of ""Backlash: What Happens When We Talk Honestly about Racism in America."" And that, Yancy says, is new.

""Black people experience policing every day, even if it's just a look or a gaze,"" he says. ""What social media is doing is magnifying the elephant in the room in such a way as to reveal to white people the reality that black people experience all the time.""

Whatâ€™s fueling the sudden attention? The use of viral internet memes at a time of heightened racial tensions in the U.S.

The current firestorm was set off in May by a white woman, Jennifer Schulte, who was rechristened BBQ Becky after she called police on two black men for using a charcoal grill at a public park in Oakland, California. The police eventually advised the men charcoal wasn't permitted in that part of the park, but the YouTube video of the interaction â€“ with Schulte on the phone arguing with other residents â€“ went viral. Three weeks later, the community threw a BBQâ€™n While Black cookout at the lake where the incident occurred.

â€œHello, Iâ€™d like to report black people minding their own business,â€ joked one meme showing a stern Schulte in dark sunglasses, blue hoodie and pulled back hair with a phone pressed to her ear.

Quickly the internet photoshopped Schulte into scenes from ""Black Panther"" and into a famous painting of the Last Supper. She was pictured reporting Rosa Parks for sitting at the front of the bus, NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem and former President Barack Obama for wearing a tan suit while he was president. ""Saturday Night Live"" even had her show up during the â€œWeekend Updateâ€ and the credits.

Last month, a white woman in San Francisco dubbed â€œPermit Pattyâ€ got the meme treatment after she called police about an 8-year-old girl selling bottled water outside her apartment building to raise money for a trip to Disneyland after her mom lost her job.

Erin Austin, the girl's mother, recorded Alison Ettel, who said she was calling the police because the child didn't have a permit. When Ettel saw she was being filmed, she crouched behind a wall. â€œYou can hide all you want, the whole worldâ€™s going to see you,â€ Austin tells her in the Instagram video.

And it did. Memes of Ettel quickly spread: â€œHello 911,â€ reads one. â€œIâ€™m scared for my life a little girl is selling water bottles.â€ According to a transcript of the 911 report, Ettel called to ask if a vendor operating without a permit was legal and was transferred to the police, who did not show up. In the aftermath, she resigned as CEO of a medicinal marijuana dispensary.

Memes are a shorthand communication, quick bursts of images or videos wrapped in humor and created to be passed around the internet, often with hashtags, to send a political or social message. These messages only grow louder and travel farther as people pick up on them and add their own humor or viewpoint.

At first, people filmed the incidents out of fear they could end in violence when police arrived. Then they became teachable moments about racism.

""Memes are part of this emergent social media vernacular making racist incidents more visible,"" says Benjamin Burroughs, a professor of emerging media at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

And that's forcing more people to recognize and reckon with white racial attitudes and behavior in a way they never have before.

A white man in North Carolina dubbed â€œID Adamâ€ who called police on a black mother and her child at a community pool was fired from his job. A South Carolina woman dubbed â€œPool Patrol Paulaâ€ lost her job and is facing assault and battery charges after allegedly striking a black teen and using the N-word at a community pool and then biting an officer during her arrest.

Two employees at a CVS drug store were fired after one accused a Chicago woman of trying to use a fraudulent coupon and the other called police. And a white female motorist near San Francisco who cut off a black couple in her Audi and then screamed racial slurs at them reportedly met a similar fate after the video was posted on social media.

""The pervasiveness of technology, that can help in an incident like this"" to hold people accountable, Officer Herman Baza, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol, told local television station KTVU.

Toxic-white-people feel like it is LITERALLY against the law for Black and Brown folks to disobey their request. They immediately jump into citizens arrest mode, playing the role of deputy doinâ€™ too much, using their whiteness and its proximity to police protection as a weapon. pic.twitter.com/JiJ94NX1MG â€” LEFTâš«ï¸ (@LeftSentThis) June 24, 2018

People often think of racism as major acts of aggression, but sociologists say smaller-scale acts, sometimes referred to as microaggressions, are more common. They can include everything from disapproving looks to chastising remarks for perceived infractions of racial etiquette, social norms dating back to slavery days and Jim Crow laws on racial segregation that dictated how black people should behave in public and interact with white people.

The way white people caught in these videos on social media lay claim to public places amounts to individual acts of gentrification, sending the message: This is my space and you can only behave here the way I say you can, Yancy says.

â€œIf it's a white girl selling lemonade, a white woman is not going to call the police and say: â€˜Hey, there is a suspicious person selling lemonade without the appropriate permit. I want the police to come,' "" says Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, a Duke sociology professor who studies race.

White people have a long and dangerous history of calling the police on black people for simply going about their daily lives, says Anne Rawls, a sociology professor at Bentley University, who has studied this phenomenon for decades and has dubbed it ""citizen callers.""

She and Meghan Hollis, a criminal justice professor at Texas State University, estimate that 80 percent of policing involves responding to citizen calls for service.

Rawls recalls one police dispatcher rattled by a phone call from someone reporting six black kids for simply walking into a sandwich shop together. â€œIf I donâ€™t dispatch a car and something happens, we're liable, so I have to dispatch a car,â€ she says the dispatcher told her at the time.

Sometimes the police officer warns callers they could be charged with making a false police report if it happens again. Other times they go through the motions of responding and then move on, Rawls and Hollis say.

What's different now is that callers are no longer hiding behind their phones, Rawls says. ""They are getting into peopleâ€™s faces,â€ she said. ""They are feeling emboldened.""

America has a legacy of racism going back hundreds of years, so whatâ€™s giving people new license to confront blacks and other minorities in public spaces?

John Powell, who leads the UC Berkeley Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society, blames President Donald Trumpâ€™s rhetoric on race and immigration and his equating activists protesting racism with neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump's supporters, like the president himself, don't see it that way. A recent Quinnipiac University poll found 86 percent of Republicans said he wasn't racist, compared to 47 percent for the entire country.

The total number of hate crimes in the 10 largest cities in America jumped in 2017 for the fourth consecutive year. The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University found a 12.5 percent increase in incidents reported by police last year in cities such as Chicago, Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles. Brian Levin, co-author of the report, attributed the increase to greater ""incivility"" in national politics, citing policies such as Trump's travel ban from several majority-Muslim countries.

Rawls says the outing of white people on social media has begun to challenge what language and behavior is considered acceptable. Itâ€™s also making people confront an uncomfortable reality, that the people being caught on film are not Ku Klux Klan members, but seemingly average Americans all over the country who could be their friends, family members or neighbors, evidence that racial attitudes are deeply entrenched in American society and cross political lines.

â€œIf we were all wearing bodycams, we would catch ourselves doing similar kinds of things,â€ she says.

The awareness growing through viral social media posts is a start, but technology has its limits and alone can't curb racism or microaggressions, sociologists say.

The 1991 police beating of Rodney King after a high-speed chase through Los Angeles was caught on camera by a bystander. The graphic video was broadcast into homes across the nation and around the world, yet the officers were not convicted.

The Black Lives Matter hashtag, created after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2013, has been used nearly 30 million times on Twitter â€“ an average of 17,003 times per day â€“ dramatically raising awareness of the type of escalation black people fear from whites and from the police yet police shootings of unarmed black people have not stopped.

Even more visceral are the live-streamed videos of fatal police shootings, such as the footage filmed by Philando Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, who in 2016 broadcast on Facebook the bloody and emotional aftermath as a police officer pointed his gun through the window, her 4-year-old daughter in the backseat. Last year, a jury acquitted the Minnesota police officer in the shooting outside St. Paul.

Lasting change won't come from Facebook or Twitter but from mobilizing all races to fight injustice together, Bonilla-Silva said.

â€œI am not saying we shouldnâ€™t complain on social media. I am not saying we shouldn't demand apologies, demand resignations and demand that some people be fired,â€ he said. â€œBut what I'm saying is, if that's all we do, we will probably not succeed in achieving equality.""

3UUIU9GZC6NH9RHZJMKO18BCCLAT59,The Popularity Of Europe's Far-Right Is Surging Even As Migrant Arrivals By Sea Plummet,"After blocking ships with rescued migrants from docking at Italian ports and announcing plans for a â€œcensusâ€ of the countryâ€™s Roma population, divisive Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has become the new poster boy for Europeâ€™s resurgent far-right.

As leader of the anti-immigration League party, Salvini is among a host of far-right politicians who gained a footing by vilifying migrants and who are now enjoying unprecedented support.

A poll last week showed that two-thirds of Italians agreed with the policy of blocking rescue boats from the ports, and the Leagueâ€™s support has nearly doubled in the last month.

The League also built on its support at local elections over the weekend, winning in the second round of votes even in cities that had swung traditionally to the left. Salvini called the win â€œhistoric.â€

Elsewhere, Germanyâ€™s anti-immigrant far-right party, Alternative for Germany, polled higher than ever before at 16 percent in a survey released Sunday in the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. German Chancellor Angela Merkelâ€™s conservative coalition, meanwhile, slumped two points to 31 percent.

The two countries will likely spare over how E.U. states should handle the migration question at a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.

Across Europe, support for populist far-right parties is higher than at any time in the last 30 years, a Bloomberg analysis found last year. And while people were found to be motivated by a variety of concerns when they vote, polls have shown that immigration is the top concern among E.U. citizens.

Stefano Rellandini / Reuters Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini suggested that the country create a register to track the Roma population living in Italy.

The latest figures on arrivals from across the Mediterranean, however, tell a different story about the â€œthreatâ€ facing Europe. Even though migrants are still attempting to make the journey from North Africa in search of new beginnings, the number of people seeking entry to Europe is way down compared to levels seen in recent years.

Just over 43,000 migrants had arrived in Europe by sea this year as of Tuesday, according to United Nations data. Thatâ€™s compared to more than 230,000 in the same period in 2016. The year before, more than 1 million people entered by sea.

In Italy alone, more than 600,000 migrants have reached the country by boat from Africa in the past five years but numbers have dropped dramatically in recent months, with arrivals down more than 77 percent this year from last.

Itâ€™s an indication that the European Union isnâ€™t facing a migration crisis, per se. Instead, itâ€™s up against political chasms that could tear the bloc apart, experts said.

We know that public support for radical right parties is not really affected by the objective number of migrant or refugee arrivals. Matthew Goodwin, author of the forthcoming book â€œNational Populismâ€ and senior visiting fellow at Chatham House

â€œWe know that public support for radical right parties is not really affected by the objective number of migrant or refugee arrivals,â€ Matthew Goodwin, author of the forthcoming book â€œNational Populismâ€ and senior visiting fellow at Chatham House, told HuffPost. Rosa Balfour, a senior transatlantic fellow at The Germany Marshall Fund of the United States, agreed, adding that the issues being put forth by populist parties are actually â€œquite disconnected from reality.â€

â€œThe migration issue is such an easy target,â€ Balfour said. â€œItâ€™s so easy to stoke fears which exist in society, namely the preoccupations about cultural identity. The way in which refugee or migrant boats are depicted in the media give the impression of being under siege regardless of actual numbers.â€

National populism, Goodwin added, is often stronger in countries with fewer refugees or migrants like Hungary, meaning that overall, â€œEurope generally is very fertile soil for parties campaigning against immigration,â€ he said.

Handout . / Reuters Migrants sit on the deck of the MV Aquarius, a search and rescue ship run in partnership between SOS Mediterranee and Medecins Sans Frontieres in the central Mediterranean Sea, June 12, 2018.

Italy escalated its anti-immigration stance last month when the national elections brought a far-right party and an anti-establishment party to power. President Donald Trump, who met Salvini briefly in 2016, complimented Italyâ€™s â€œvery strongâ€ stance on immigration earlier this month.

Salvini told his European partners that Italy will no longer be the blocâ€™s â€œrefugee camp.â€ Soon after coming to power, he prevented any migrant search and rescue vessels operated by non-governmental organizations from docking in Italian ports. Salvini first blocked the Aquarius, a ship run by two NGOs, from making its way to Italy earlier this month, urging other European Union frontline countries to do their fair share in dealing with migrant influxes. He has since done the same to a second ship.

Salvini also expressed an interest in creating a registry of Italyâ€™s Roma population, a nod to the countryâ€™s fascist history during World War Two.

â€œItâ€™s a perceived alarm, not a real one, numbers speak for themselves. In this city alone we welcomed 22,000 migrants in 2016, 11,000 last year, and this year, so far, about 3,000 people,â€ Pozzallo Mayor Roberto Ammatuna told Sky TG24, an Italian news channel.

Figures like Ammatuna seem to be overshadowed by the general sentiment that the refugee crisis â€œhas still been quite a shock for lots of Italian voters,â€ Goodwin said.

These â€œprofound, long-term structural changesâ€ to European politics likely mean that nationalist, populist parties will continue to gain ground, Goodwin added. â€œEurope is aging, and itâ€™s going to be facing continued demographic pressure from North Africa, populations that are younger and growing a lot faster.â€

It doesnâ€™t help that thereâ€™s no easy policy solution, Balfour noted, meaning that there will continue to be an opening for the far-right.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/europe-far-right-migrants_us_5b321212e4b0b5e692f12bcc,"['Strongly Republican', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Republican', 'Neutral']","['1', '2', '1', '2', '2']"

PORTLAND, Ore. â€” The makeshift city outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building here has swelled to more than 90 tents, and protesters appear to be willing to dig in for the long haul. Itâ€™s been 10 days now, and â€œMultnomah Campâ€ is fortified with a wall made of wood and blue tarps and is adorned with signs declaring a simple message.

â€œAbolish ICE.â€

In chalk, the protesters have written â€œNazis Inside,â€ and those inside have looked down on the din from top-floor offices. Thus far, it has been boisterous but peaceful.

As the Trump administration continues its border crackdown on illegal immigration amid fluctuating policies â€” including a now-abandoned strategy of separating children from their parents, which drew international scorn â€” this protest has served as a spark to others across the country. Portland, already a protest-prone city, is again at the center of pushing back against the Trump administration and its supporters, this time by going after ICE.

Much larger cities have since picked up on the ICE encampment tactics started here, including in New York and Los Angeles, and protesters here arenâ€™t surprised that homegrown Portland protest tactics are catching on elsewhere. This is a city that thrives on dissent, a place former president George H.W. Bush once called Little Beirut, that exploded in protests in the wake of Trumpâ€™s election and that continues to be a stage for antifa and Proud Boys to throw punches.

[A protest movement shut down an ICE facility in Portland â€” and is spreading to other cities]

â€œItâ€™s a part of our organic fabric of Portland. The energy and the anti-establishment fervor here is unlike any other place on the West Coast,â€ said T. Oliver, 46, who has come to the ICE protest during the daytime with his daughter. â€œThis isnâ€™t some Democratic Party agenda â€¦ it really is grass roots, nonviolent revolution.â€

Danialle James, 32, leads an impromptu tour of the camp: Thereâ€™s no leadership here, people say, but some members of the community speak via walkie talkies, and thereâ€™s a color-coded system of bandannas to signify duties. James, wearing a red Notorious BIG T-shirt, made her way through a camp kitchen where a walkway has been constructed out of wooden boards, where two volunteers were slicing watermelon and chopping vegetables. They put out bowls of fresh cherries and carrot sticks.

â€œPeople come everyday with stuff for us,â€ she said. A young man walked in with a tent to donate, another brought bags of ice and two grocery sacks of supplies.

Federal officials have been trying to get the camp to break up and move on. For the past two days, people have received notices detailing the laws the camp violates. â€œI guess you could call that a threat,â€ James said.

Robert Sperling, a Federal Protective Service spokesman, confirmed that right now â€œa collectionâ€ of FPS officers and ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations officers are inside the office building â€œensuring the security of the facility.â€ Sperling said protesters have not tried to enter the building but â€œwe have had people trying to barricade the doors so that anybody inside canâ€™t get out.â€

He said the warnings that have been given to protesters detail possible charges they could face for obstructing the facility. â€œFrankly, itâ€™s kind of up to them at this point,â€ he said. Sperling said there is no timeline for arrests, but discussions in his office, he says, revolve around â€œhow do we continue to mitigate the impact, while allowing them to continue to express their narrative?â€

The protesters vow that Multnomah Camp will continue as a fully functioning mini-city until ICE shuts down.

The protesters have wrangled the basics for long-term survival: a hydration station, a medical tent, an â€œengineering tentâ€ with volunteers who help campers fortify their housing with tarps, cords and repair kids. Thereâ€™s a mental health tent, where a woman with a long gray ponytail and a purple bandanna says people can come â€œif they need a mom or a grandmaâ€ and to get some quiet. Thereâ€™s a tent where people have offered massages and guided meditations. In a kids' tent lined with bookshelves and art supplies, a little girl flipped through a picture book.

The camp is in one of Portlandâ€™s newest neighborhoods, the South Waterfront â€” an area that a decade ago was an industrial brownfield. Now there are high-rise apartments, medical facilities, pizza joints, coffee shops and strips of urban park.

James says she has participated in several protest actions in Portland since Trumpâ€™s inauguration, many of which ended in mass arrests and local police deploying crowd-control devices such as rubber bullets and flash grenades. But in the case of Multnomah Camp, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted that he has refused to aid ICE in dispersing the protesters.

â€œI drove by the demonstration yesterday, it seemed to be very peaceful and I was pleased to see that,â€ Wheeler tweeted on June 20.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions gave a speech here in September 2017, decrying sanctuary cities like Portland and condemning politicians like Wheeler for bucking federal policies.

If federal officials â€œare looking for a bailout from this mayorâ€ to end the ICE encampment â€œthey are looking in the wrong place,â€ Wheeler tweeted.

City Councilmember Chloe Eudaly said at a meeting Wednesday that her office is looking into the possibility of revoking ICEâ€™s lease at the Portland building. Margaux Weeke, a spokeswoman for Eudaly, said the office is looking into options for removing ICE: â€œWe are definitely very supportive of the occupy movement. Weâ€™re doing our very best to support everything that theyâ€™re doing.â€

James says the character of this protest is different from others sheâ€™s been a part of in Portland, which often include majority-white crowds. At the ICE protest, she said, â€œyouâ€™ve got people from all walks of life. â€¦ Being here is what the world should look like. It gives you hope.â€

She paused at the buildingâ€™s entrance, where a handful of military veterans have camped, and glanced at the doors, which were plastered with protest signs. She pointed up to the top floor of the building where silhouettes could be seen peering out over the camp. â€œSee them waving?â€ she said, turning her wave around into an obscene gesture.

Because there is no central leadership here, not everyone is on the same page about when this should end. Oliver considers the protest successful already: â€œWhat I would like to see happened has happened: the message, the shutdown, the back pedaling from President Trump.â€

Others wonâ€™t budge, such as a group of military veterans who block a driveway leading to the building. Stu Tanquist, 57, is one of them.

â€œAs vets, we swore an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States,â€ he said, arguing that ICE is violating the Constitution by committing â€œhorrific human rights abuses.â€ He is refusing to leave, pointing over his shoulder to a gray tent steps away from the buildingâ€™s entrance. â€œThe only way theyâ€™ll get me out is to drag me out.â€

Tanquist, who served in the Minnesota National Guard and is now homeless, says he arrived last week when he heard a call for more protesters; he believes it is more difficult for authorities to expel veterans than others who might protest.

â€œIâ€™m just appalled at whatâ€™s been done in the name of this country,â€ he said. â€œI have a choice. I can choose to stay here, or I could choose to leave,â€ he said, noting that this is part of his â€œprivilege of being male and being white. â€¦ All that compels me to be in front and stand in front of people who have no choice.â€

John Grimes, 56, sat with a friend in recliners near the camp kitchen. Grimes said all that he needed to see to bring him here was â€œthe kids locked up and crying for their parents.â€

The looming threat of arrest is bothering him. What will happen if law enforcement raids the camp? Could he jeopardize his social security benefits?

A veteran protester behind him chimed in: â€œBetter losing your SSI than your life or your due process.â€",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2018/06/27/portland-ice-protest-grows-demonstrators-seek-abolish-agency-amid-immigration-crisis/,"['Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic']","['1', '5', '5', '5', '4']"

A federal judge in California has ordered U.S. immigration authorities to reunite separated families on the border within 30 days, describing the Trump administration's handling of the crisis as attempts ""to address a chaotic circumstance of the governmentâ€™s own making.""

The preliminary injunction from U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego said children younger than 5 must be reunified within 14 days of the order issued Tuesday.

Sabraw, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, also issued a nationwide injunction on future family separations unless the parent is deemed unfit or doesnâ€™t want to be with the child. It also requires the government to provide phone contact between parents and their children within 10 days.

Despite the ruling, organizers of a protest rally at the U.S.-Mexico border planned to go ahead with their event on Thursday.

The rally was scheduled to begin at the federal courthouse in Brownsville, Texas, to protest what organizers called ""Trumpâ€™s inhumane treatment of immigrants.â€

The organizers included the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Texas, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, Rio Grande Equal Voice Network, We Belong Together and Jay Ellis, an activist and actor from HBOâ€™s â€œInsecure.â€

â€œThe rally is still on, and we are mobilizing people, as this is far from over,â€ said Ana Blinder, an ACLU representative. â€œThe crisis engulfing immigrant children and families is now. â€œ

The federal ruling in San Diego is in response to a lawsuit filed by an anonymous woman from the Democratic Republic of Congo who was separated from her 17-year-old girl and by a Brazilian mother separated from her 14-year-old. It was backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, which pursued it as a class action after U.S. authorities began a ""zero tolerance"" policy in early May toward people crossing the border.

Lee Gelernt, an ACLU attorney who represented the families in this California case, praised the judge's ruling.

CLOSE A judge in California on Tuesday ordered U.S. border authorities to reunite separated families within 30 days, setting a hard deadline in a process that has so far yielded uncertainty about when children might again see their parents. Time

â€œThis is a complete victory for these parents and children who feared they might never see each other again,"" Gelernt said. ""Tears of joy will be flowing in the detention centers when they hear the news. We hope the administration will now turn its efforts to reuniting these kids.â€

The Department of Justice said the court's decision ""makes it even more imperative that Congress finally act to give federal law enforcement the ability to simultaneously enforce the law and keep families together. ""

""Without this action by Congress, lawlessness at the border will continue, which will only lead to predictable results â€“ more heroin and fentanyl pushed by Mexican cartels plaguing our communities, a surge in MS-13 gang members and an increase in the number of human trafficking prosecutions,â€ the department said in a statement.

Under the terms of the zero tolerance policy, children were separated from their parents when the adults were arrested for alleged illegal entry into the U.S.

More than 2,000 children have been separated from their parents in recent weeks and placed in government-contracted shelters â€“ hundreds of miles away, in some cases â€“ under a now-abandoned policy for families caught illegally entering the U.S.

President Donald Trump hastily issued an executive order to stop the separation of families while officials began the reunification process after a national outcry.

Sabraw called the unfolding of events since the zero tolerance policy was put into effect ""reactive governance â€“ responses to address a chaotic circumstance of the governmentâ€™s own making.""

""They belie measured and ordered governance, which is central to the concept of

due process enshrined in our Constitution,"" Sabraw wrote.

In his 24-page order, the judge also slammed the administration's lack of preparedness in implementing its policy.

â€œThe government readily keeps track of personal property of detainees in criminal and immigration proceedings,â€ Sabraw wrote. â€œMoney, important documents, and automobiles, to name a few, are routinely catalogued, stored, tracked and produced upon a detaineeâ€™s release, at all levels â€“ state and federal, citizen and alien. Yet, the government has no system in place to keep track of, provide effective communication with, and promptly produce alien children. The unfortunate reality is that under the present system migrant children are not accounted for with the same efficiency and accuracy as property. Certainly, that cannot satisfy the requirements of due process.â€

Also Tuesday, 17 states, including New York and California, sued the Trump administration to force it to reunite children and parents. The states, all led by Democratic attorneys general, joined Washington, D.C., in filing the lawsuit in federal court in Seattle, arguing that they are being forced to shoulder increased child welfare, education and social services costs.

â€œThe administrationâ€™s practice of separating families is cruel, plain and simple,â€ New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in a statement. â€œEvery day, it seems like the administration is issuing new, contradictory policies and relying on new, contradictory justifications. But we canâ€™t forget: The lives of real people hang in the balance.â€

In a speech before the conservative Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in Los Angeles, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the administration for taking a hard-line stand on illegal immigration and said the voters elected Trump to do just that.

â€œThis is the Trump era,â€ he said. â€œWe are enforcing our laws again. We know whose side we are on â€“ so does this group â€“ and weâ€™re on the side of police, and weâ€™re on the side of the public safety of the American people.â€

Juan Sanchez, chief executive of the nationâ€™s largest shelters for migrant children, said he fears a lack of urgency by the U.S. government could mean it will take months to reunite families.

Sanchez, with the nonprofit Southwest Key Programs, said in an interview with The Associated Press that the government has no process in place to speed the return of children to their parents.

â€œIt could take days,â€ he said. â€œOr it could take a month, two months, six or even nine. I just donâ€™t know.â€

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Congress on Tuesday that his department still has custody of 2,047 immigrant children separated from their parents at the border. That is only six fewer children than the number in HHS custody as of last Wednesday.

Democratic senators said that wasnâ€™t nearly enough progress.

â€œHHS, Homeland Security and the Justice Department seem to be doing a lot more to add to the bedlam and deflect blame than theyâ€™re doing to tell parents where their kids are,â€ Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said.

Azar refused to be pinned down on how long it will take to reunite families. He said his department does extensive vetting of parents to make sure they are not traffickers masquerading as parents.

Tens of thousands of Central American migrants traveling with children â€“ as well as children traveling alone â€“ are caught on the Mexican border each year. Many are fleeing gang violence in their home countries.

At a Texas detention facility, immigrant advocates complained that parents have gotten busy signals or no answers from a 1-800 number provided by federal authorities to get information about their children.

Attorneys have spoken to about 200 immigrants at the Port Isabel detention facility near Los Fresnos, Texas, since last week, and only a few knew where their children were being held, said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg of the Legal Aid Justice Center in Virginia.

â€œThe U.S. government never had any plan to reunite these families that were separated,â€ Sandoval-Moshenberg said, and now it is â€œscrambling to undo this terrible thing that they have done.â€

A message left for HHS, which runs the hotline, was not immediately returned.

Many children in shelters in southern Texas have not had contact with their parents, though some have reported being allowed to speak with them in recent days, said Meghan Johnson Perez, director of the Childrenâ€™s Project for the South Texas Pro Bono Asylum Representation Project, which provides free legal services to minors.

â€œThings might be changing now. The agencies are trying to coordinate better,â€ she said. â€œBut the kids we have been seeing have not been in contact with the parents. They donâ€™t know where the parent is. Theyâ€™re just distraught. Their urgent need is just trying to figure out, â€˜Where is my parent?â€™â€

Administration officials have been casting about for detention space for migrants since calling for an end to separations. The Pentagon has drawn up plans to hold as many as 20,000 at U.S. military bases.

The administration has also asked the courts to let it detain families together for an extended period while their immigration cases are resolved. Under a 1997 court settlement, children must be released from detention as quickly as possible, which generally has been construed to be within 20 days.

Immigrant supporters have led protests in recent days in states such as Florida and Texas. In Los Angeles, police arrested 25 demonstrators at a rally Tuesday ahead of Sessionsâ€™ address.

Outside the U.S. attorneyâ€™s office, protesters carried signs reading, â€œFree the children!â€ and â€œStop caging families.â€ Clergy members blocked the street by forming a human chain. Police handcuffed them and led them away.

Later, protesters gathered outside the hotel where Sessions gave his speech. As the attorney generalâ€™s motorcade arrived, the crowd chanted, â€œNazi, go home.â€

38G0E1M85NND7YB3PISBA2RD80BUVQ,Senator John McCain: Who is the Republican elder statesman?,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Senator John McCain turns 81 in August 2017

A war hero, a political maverick, and one of President Trump's fiercest Republican critics - Senator John McCain, 81, has been granted all these titles over the years.

Known in Washington for his doggedness and common-sense conservatism, he beat off younger rivals to secure the Republican party's nomination for president in 2008.

As a US Navy pilot, Mr McCain narrowly escaped death in July 1967 when a missile exploded near his fuel tanks, sparking a ship fire that left 134 troops dead.

Three months later he was shot down over Vietnam, where he spent five years as a prisoner of war.

The son of a four-star admiral, he was offered early release due to his father's prominence - but rejected it. Instead, he endured repeated beatings and torture, including two years in solitary confinement.

The six-term senator now faces another grave battle, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.

Mr McCain had surgery to remove a blood clot from near his left eye on 14 July, and was found to have an aggressive form of brain tumour known as glioblastoma.

Well-wishes from across the political divide saw four former presidents praise his tenacity, with President Trump sending his ""thoughts and prayers"", and Barack Obama - his rival for the presidency in 2008 - commenting, ""John McCain is an American hero... Cancer doesn't know what it's up against.""

Mr McCain stayed in the armed forces after his return to the US, ultimately acting as naval liaison to the Senate until his retirement in 1981.

Political rise

It was at this point that he moved to Arizona to embark on a political career, winning a congressional seat in 1982 and securing a Senate seat four years later.

Running against George W Bush for the 2000 presidential nomination, Mr McCain's direct style won him initial support and he secured a surprise victory in the New Hampshire primary.

But he was hit by a number of attacks as campaigning turned increasingly negative, and later fell out with influential members of the so-called ""religious right"".

The choice of Christian conservative Sarah Palin as running mate for his 2008 presidential campaign was designed to win over such Republicans.

Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption John McCain pictured with running mate Sarah Palin in 2008

Mr McCain has never been afraid to adopt a controversial position - especially since Donald Trump's emergence in politics.

Though he has since hardened some of his views, he has previously attracted the ire of social conservatives for his relatively moderate views on civil unions, abortion and immigration reform.

He was one of the Iraq war's strongest supporters, and backed the troop increase there known as the ""surge"".

As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee he has been a vocal - and hawkish - force in foreign policy and military affairs.

While battling Mr Obama for the White House, Mr McCain stressed his own experience in these areas and argued that he would make a far better commander-in-chief.

Concerned by Trump

The Arizona Senator has repeatedly criticised President Trump's warming relations with Russia, and spent New Year's Eve 2016 with Ukrainian Marines.

""We stand w/them in their fight against #Putin's aggression,"" he tweeted then.

Image copyright Twitter/JohnMcCain

Mr McCain withdrew his support for Mr Trump - then his party's presidential nominee - in October 2016, the day after a 2005 recording emerged of him making obscene remarks about women and appearing to trivialise sexual assault.

""When Mr Trump attacks women and demeans the women in our nation and in our society, that is a point where I just have to part company,"" he said.

In July 2017, he told CBS's Face the Nation that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""got away with"" trying to change the result of the 2016 US presidential election.

Working with Democrats

The Republican elder has repeatedly shown himself willing to work with Democrats or vote against his party on ideological grounds, including when he voted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and against George W Bush's tax cuts.

He co-sponsored a bipartisan immigration bill in 2007 which, had it passed, would have offered an amnesty to illegal immigrants as well as tougher border controls.

And he was the author, with Democrat Senator Russ Feingold, of a major campaign finance reform in 2002 intended to reduce the influence of money and pressure groups in US elections.

He has criticised President Trump's refugee travel ban, saying it betrays American values and ""in some areas, will give Isis [Islamic State] some more propaganda"".

When news broke of the president's confrontational first phone call with Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Mr McCain phoned Australia's US ambassador, Joe Hockey, to express ""unwavering support"" for the countries' relationship.

In 2017, Mr McCain travelled to war-torn Syria to visit US forces deployed there.

He called the Trump administration's decision not to prioritise ending the Syrian civil war ""another disgraceful chapter in American history"".

As reports emerged of his cancer diagnosis in summer 2017, the senator's office said he was ""in good spirits as he continues to recover at home with his family"".

But news a year later that he had discontinued medical treatment suggested the old granite-faced warrior had lost his last battle, and left the political world in mourning.",https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40666269,"['Republican', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Republican']","['2', '1', '1', '2', '2']"
3XU80RHWH0YFWNY9QG06O8T6WCZ44S,More Than 400 Kids Separated From Parents At The Border Are Still In Government Custody,"The Trump administrationâ€™s weekly report on efforts to reunite children it separated from their parents at the border shows 416 children, including 14 under age 5, remain in custody.

The latest status report, filed Thursday as part of an ACLU lawsuit, shows the government continues to make slow progress in returning children to their families. It has been more than a month since a federal judgeâ€™s July 26 deadline to reunite all of the more than 2,600 children detained under the Trump administrationâ€™s highly criticized zero-tolerance immigration policy.

Stringer . / Reuters Gilberto Calmo hugs his son Franklin Noe Calmo, who was sent back from detention on Tuesday, after they were separated at the U.S. border, in Guatemala City, Guatemala August 7, 2018.

The latest government report shows that in addition to the more than 400 children who remain in government custody, 204 have been â€œdischarged under other appropriate circumstances,â€ such as returning to family members other than their parents, or to guardians or sponsors.

Government officials say they have delayed some reunifications because of â€œred flags,â€ such as criminal histories discovered through background checks, or other safety and well-being concerns. But the ACLU argues in Thursdayâ€™s report that some of these concerns are questionable, and asks the government to expedite two such cases.

In one case, a 4-year-old boyâ€™s mother is a suspected gang member, according to the government. She has denied the accusation, and a judge found that a warrant â€œwas not sufficient evidence that the mother was a danger to the community,â€ according to the ACLU. The government, however, has refused to reunite her with her child.

â€œThis child is suffering greatly in detention and is at particular risk of grievous and irreparable harm,â€ the ACLU says in the report.

The ACLU also asks the government to explain discrepancies, such as why the government lists 35 delayed reunifications involving criminal â€œred flags,â€ while the ACLU has identified about 50 parents who havenâ€™t been reunited with their children because of background checks.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/border-separations-weekly-status-numbers_us_5b926780e4b0cf7b003ee9ed,"['Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['5', '5', '5', '5', '5']"
3RIHDBQ1NFGPCPBABRKL4RJAN85MHQ,"'Angel Families', Trump aides rally against illegal immigrant crime","In the continued fallout over the murder of an Iowa college student, allegedly at the hands of a Mexican man, advisers to President Trump joined â€œAngel Familiesâ€ at a rally outside the U.S. Capitol on Friday to draw attention to crime committed by illegal immigrants.

â€œYou will never be silenced, and your loved ones will never be forgotten,â€ White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told families. â€œHereâ€™s the truth: open borders leads to massive crime. And massive crime that is totally avoidable.â€

Others at the rally included former White House deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who recently lost his Republican bid for the U.S. Senate in Arizona.

â€œI also will never forget the names of these individuals, whether itâ€™s Mollie Tibbetts or it's Kate Steinle,â€ Gorka said.

Tibbetts went missing after going for a jog in Brooklyn, Iowa, on July 18. Police in August arrested a 24-year old illegal immigrant from Mexico and charged him with her murder.

Steinle was shot to death on Pier 14 in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant in July 2015. Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, who had had been deported five times, was acquitted of Steinleâ€™s murder in 2017 after arguing he shot her by accident.

Trump has highlighted both cases, as he pushes for tougher measures to prevent illegal immigration. Democrats, some of whom are pushing to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, accuse Trump of exploiting isolated incidents.

More than 10 â€œAngel Familiesâ€ - those whose family members were killed by illegal immigrants - were among the dozens in attendance at the rally.

Several speakers recounted stories of how their family members were killed, and spoke of the danger of sanctuary cities, arguing illegal immigrant crime can be prevented by securing the border.

â€œMy daughter Sarah Root was killed less than 24 hours after graduating from Bellevue University,â€ said Michelle Root, one of the founders of the â€œAngel Familiesâ€ organization.

Root said her 21-year-old daughter was on her way home after celebrating her graduation with friends on Jan 31, 2016. Sarah was stopped at a light in Omaha, Nebraska when an illegal immigrant rear-ended her car at a high speed, killing her. Root said the suspect posted bond, but fled before trial.

â€œHe is still on the loose,â€ Root said. â€œWe are still trying to find him to get justice for our daughter, and to prevent him from killing somebody elseâ€™s family.â€

Mary Ann Mendoza of Arizona told the story of how her son, Brandon, a police officer who was killed by an illegal immigrant in a head-on collision in May 2014 in Phoenix.

â€œItâ€™s important that our fellow Americans know the magnitude of crimes that are being committed,â€ Mendoza said.

Mendoza issued a warning to those watching, saying itâ€™s a real â€œproblem.â€

â€œYou are going to know somebody â€“ a friend, a family member who is going to be affected by illegal [immigrant] crime in the future,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s inevitable.â€

Neither the Tibbetts nor Steinle families attended the rally. Tibbetts father, Rob Tibbetts, recently pleaded with politicians to â€œleave us out of your debate,â€ saying, â€œIâ€™m imploring you to stop.â€

â€œAllow us to grieve in privacy and with dignity,â€ Tibbetts wrote last week in the Des Moines Register.",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/09/07/angel-families-trump-aides-rally-against-illegal-immigrant-crime.html,"['Republican', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Strongly Republican']","['2', '4', '5', '5', '5']"
3BAWBGQGYMHB9NZ7CAZ00ADT0CM7VJ,"For now, Army suspends discharges of immigrant recruits","The U.S. Army has stopped discharging immigrant recruits who enlisted seeking a path to citizenship â€” at least temporarily.

A memo shared with The Associated Press on Wednesday and dated July 20 spells out orders to high-ranking Army officials to stop processing discharges of men and women who enlisted in the special immigrant program, effective immediately.

It was not clear how many recruits were impacted by the action, and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the memo.

â€œEffective immediately, you will suspend processing of all involuntary separation actions,â€ read the memo signed by Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs Marshall Williams.

The disclosure comes one month after the AP reported that dozens of immigrant enlistees were being discharged or had their contracts cancelled. Some said they were given no reason for their discharge. Others said the Army informed them theyâ€™d been labeled as security risks because they have relatives abroad or because the Defense Department had not completed background checks on them.

Early last month, the Pentagon said there had been no specific policy change and that background checks were ongoing. And in mid-July the Army reversed one discharge, for Brazilian reservist Lucas Calixto, 28, who had sued. Nonetheless, discharges of other immigrant enlistees continued. Attorneys sought to bring a class action lawsuit last week to offer protections to a broader group of reservists and recruits in the program, demanding that prior discharges be revoked and that further separations be halted.

A judgeâ€™s order references the July 20 memo, and asks the Army to clarify how it impacts the discharge status of Calixto and other plaintiffs. As part of the memo, Williams also instructed Army officials to recommend whether the military should issue further guidance related to the program.

Margaret Stock, an Alaska-based immigration attorney and a retired Army Reserve lieutenant colonel who helped create the immigrant recruitment program, said Wednesday the memo proves there was a policy.

â€œItâ€™s an admission by the Army that theyâ€™ve improperly discharged hundreds of soldiers,â€ she said. â€œThe next step should be go back and rescind the people who were improperly discharged.â€

Discharged recruits and reservists reached Wednesday said their discharges were still in place as far as they knew.

One Pakistani man caught by surprise by his discharge said he was filing for asylum. He asked that his name be withheld because he fears he might be forced to return to Pakistan, where he could face danger as a former U.S. Army enlistee.

The reversal comes as the Defense Department has attempted to strengthen security requirements for the program, through which historically immigrants vowed to risk their lives for the promise of U.S. citizenship.

President George W. Bush ordered â€œexpedited naturalizationâ€ for immigrant soldiers after 9/11 in an effort to swell military ranks. Seven years later the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program, known as MAVNI, became an official recruiting program.

It came under fire from conservatives when President Barack Obama added DACA recipients â€” young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children â€” to the list of eligible enlistees. In response, the military layered on additional security clearances for recruits to pass before heading to boot camp.

The Trump Administration added even more hurdles, creating a backlog within the Defense Department. Last fall, hundreds of recruits still in the enlistment process had their contracts canceled.

Government attorneys called the recruitment program an â€œelevated security riskâ€ in another case involving 17 foreign-born military recruits who enlisted through the program but have not been able to clear additional security requirements. Some recruits had falsified their background records and were connected to state-sponsored intelligence agencies, the court filing said.

Eligible recruits are required to have legal status in the U.S., such as a student visa, before enlisting. More than 5,000 immigrants were recruited into the program in 2016, and an estimated 10,000 are currently serving. Nearly 110,000 members of the Armed Forces have gained citizenship by serving in the U.S. military since Sept. 11, 2001, according to the Defense Department.",https://www.breitbart.com/news/for-now-army-suspends-discharges-of-immigrant-recruits/,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['5', '3', '4', '5', '4']"
37MQ8Z1JQFELRGX6B95PBI0F74PY28,Florida businessman targeted as 'predator' for renting office space to ICE,"For the past two days, a Florida city has been littered with fliers accusing a local businessman of being a predator who profits from â€œsexual violence, physical abuse and the caging of undocumented peopleâ€ -- all because he rents office space to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

Chuck Prather, of St. Petersburg, said protesters who are angry with the Trump administrationâ€™s zero-tolerance illegal immigration policy are targeting him because he leases an office complex in Tampa to the government. Itâ€™s an agreement that goes back 21 years and was recently renewed.

â€œThey are trying to terrorize me,â€ he told Fox News on Thursday.

On Wednesday, dozens of fliers showing his image were posted around St. Petersburgâ€™s downtown area, where he owns several businesses, including the Birchwood Inn.

â€œI was taking my son to school yesterday when my elderly neighbor who walks dogs for a living came up to me and said, â€˜I need to talk to you,â€™â€ Prather said. â€œ[She said] there are posters all over town. It has a big picture of you and it says that you are a predator. What is going on?â€™â€

Prather added: â€œThey were everywhere.â€

The fliers, which call for people to boycott all of Pratherâ€™s businesses, say in part: â€œCharles â€˜Chuckâ€™ Prather of the Birchwood Inn directly profits from sexual violence, physical abuse and the caging of undocumented people in the greater Tampa community. Chuck has earned his wealth through leasing property to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as other border control offices.â€

And the harassment campaign didnâ€™t stop there.

On Thursday morning, Prather woke up to find more posters plastered around his home, and the words â€œEVICT ICEâ€ spray painted on the sidewalk.

â€œThis is all about ICE. This is nothing about me being a predator, which I am not,â€ he said.

Surveillance photos, provided to Fox News, from outside the Birchwood Inn show two people putting up the posters.

â€œItâ€™s horrifying,â€ Prather said. â€œI have 175 employees. They are completely innocent [and] their livelihoods are being targeted.â€

The U.S. government â€“ not ICE, specifically â€“ has leased the building complex from Prather since 1997, and he said he hasn't had any problems until the protests began last month. He said a few weeks ago he had to pay $10,000 to repair damage to the Tampa building caused by vandals.

3MDWE879UIK0ESPUMQ6KDUASSYF9BO,Mollie Tibbetts case: Murder charge filed in case of student found dead,"POWESHIEK, Iowa -- A murder charge has been filed against a man who led investigators to remains believed to be the body of 20-year-old college student Mollie Tibbetts, who disappeared from her small hometown in central Iowa one month ago. The body was discovered in a field in rural Poweshiek County, which includes Tibbetts' hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa, the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation said in a press release.

Officials say the suspect, 24-year-old Cristhian Bahena Rivera, is a Mexican national who is in the country illegally. Investigators believe Rivera followed Tibbetts on July 18 and abducted her as she was out for a jog.

Iowa Department of Public Safety

Surveillance video showed a car that investigators traced back to Rivera, said Rick Rahn, a special agent in charge with the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. Rivera is being being held on a federal immigration detainer.

A cause of death remains unclear. An autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday.

Bail was set at $1,00,000 cash.

Rahn called the slaying a ""tragic event"" and said he couldn't speak to a motive.

""It seemed that he followed her, seemed to be drawn to her on that particular day, and for whatever reason, he chose to abduct her,"" Rahn said.

According to an affidavit filed in Powesheik County District Court, security video provided by a citizen showed Tibbetts running east of Brooklyn and a dark colored Malibu driving back and forth in the area several times. Investigators connected the Malibu to Rivera, and interviewed him Aug. 20.

Rahn called the video ""extremely helpful"" in locating Rivera.

In a ""lengthy"" interview, Rivera allegedly admitted following Tibbetts, telling investigators that he parked his car, got out and started running behind and alongside her.

Rivera said Tibbetts grabbed her phone and said ""I'm gonna call the police,"" according to the affidavit. Rivera said he ""panicked and got mad,"" and then said he ""blocked"" his memory, ""which is what he does when he gets very upset."" He said he couldn't remember anything after that until he came to at an intersection.

Rivera said he made a U-turn and drove into the driveway of a cornfield, where he saw an earpiece from headphones in his lap, ""and that is how he realized he put her in the trunk.""

Rivera told police he got Tibbetts from the trunk and noticed blood on the side of her head, the affidavit says. He described her clothing and said she was wearing headphones. He said he dragged her on foot from his vehicle to a secluded location in the cornfield and then put her on his shoulder and took her about 20 meters into the field. He allegedly said he covered Tibbetts in corn leaves and left her face-up.

Rivera later led investigators to the remains, the affidavit says. Rahn said Tuesday that Rivera had been living illegally in the area for four to seven years. He faces a possible sentence of life without the possibility of parole.

Rahn said he is saddened for the family and that the case took a toll on investigators.

""We get to know the family, we get to know Mollie,"" Rahn said. ""We just spoke with the family and I told them they raised a great daughter -- she was a phenomenal individual.""

Rivera worked at a dairy farm owned by the family of a prominent state Republican leader. Yarrabee Farms said in a statement that Cristhian Bahena Rivera had worked at its farms for the last four years and was an employee in good standing. The company said it was shocked to hear that Rivera had been charged in Tibbetts' death.

Spokesman Dane Lang said Tuesday night that Yarrabee Farms is a ""small family farm"" owned by him and his father, Craig Lang, who has long been a prominent Iowa farmer and political figure.

Craig Lang previously served as president of the Iowa Farm Bureau and president of the Iowa Board of Regents, which governs the state's public universities. In June, he lost a close GOP primary in the race for state agriculture secretary.

Hundreds of people have been interviewed by investigators, who have been inundated with tips from the public during the five weeks that Tibbetts was missing.

Tibbetts was last seen July 18 in Brooklyn, a rural town of about 1,400 people, as she took a routine evening jog. She was reported missing by her family the next day, after she didn't show up for work at a day camp for children.

Tibbetts' disappearance set off a massive search involving dozens of officers from the FBI, as well as state and local agencies. They focused much of their efforts in and around Brooklyn, searching farm fields, ponds and homes. Investigators asked anyone who was around five locations, including a car wash, a truck stop and a farm south of town, to report if they saw anything suspicious on July 18.

Last week, Vice President Mike Pence met privately with the Tibbetts family during a visit to Iowa and told them that ""you're on the hearts of every American.""

At Brooklyn City Hall, city clerk Sheri Sharer said Tuesday was a sad day for the town.

""It never crossed our mind that she wouldn't come home safe,"" she said.

Crime Stoppers of Central Iowa has been publicizing a reward fund that raised around $400,000 for any tip that led to Tibbetts' safe return. The organization's Greg Willey said the fund, which included more than 220 donations from individuals, will now likely be used for any information that helps police catch the person responsible for her death.

Tibbetts, a psychology major, would have started her junior year this week at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, about 50 miles east of Brooklyn. She was staying with her longtime boyfriend and working while home from school over the summer.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mollie-tibbetts-case-university-of-iowa-student-investigators-to-give-update-in-case-of-student-found-dead-live-updates-today-2018-8-21/,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['1', '1', '3', '2', '2']"
30Z7M1Q8UZ2VHD1SBK0AINVBQMRA88,Trump Beats Clinton the Way He Beat Bush,"The end of May has brought terrible news for Donald Trump, as conventional wisdom would have it. Over Memorial Day weekend, the Libertarian Party nominated two Republican ex-governors, Gary Johnson and William Weld, as its ticket for November, while Bill Kristol assured Twitter that there would be neoconservative-friendly ""independent"" on the ballot as well. Hillary Clinton led Trump by just 1 point in the RealClearPolitics aggregate of national polling, but as polls catch up to these events, Trump is sunk. Isn't he?

Not so fast. First, take a look at the electoral map Trump inherits from Mitt Romney. The 2012 Republican nominee did not, of course, win enough states to become president, but where he did win, he won by comfortable margins: those are Trump's margins now. Of the states Romney won, there were only two that he took by less than 10 percent: North Carolina and Georgia. Trump seems like at least as good a cultural fit for the Republican elements in those states as Romney was. And the states Romney won by ""only"" ten points -- the next closest GOP margins -- were Missouri and Indiana, which seem apt to be all the more enthusiastic about this year's nominee.

Indiana and Missouri were two of the best states for Gary Johnson as the Libertarian nominee in 2012; they respectively gave him 1.91 percent and 1.57 percent of their votes. If Johnson/Weld does fully twice as well in 2016 -- which, for reasons to be mentioned shortly, is improbable -- a 4 percent and 3.1 Libertarian vote in those states would still not stop Trump from winning them. Even a doubling of the Libertarian vote in Georgia, another place where Johnson ran ahead of his national percentage in 2012, would not tip the scales: the Libertarian Party vote would go from less than 1.2 percent of the vote to about 2.4 percent, in a state that Romney won in 2012 by nearly 8 points.

But couldn't Johnson do much more than 100 percent better in 2016? After all, Trump and Clinton have the highest negative ratings of any major-party nominees since CBS began polling on the question in 1984. This creates an opening, if ever there was one, for another option -- if not a Libertarian, perhaps a candidate with Bill Kristol's ""Renegade Party.""

Unfortunately for Kristol and Johnson, that's not how politics works in 21st-century America: the sky-high negatives for both nominees mean there is in fact less space than usual for a third-party (or fourth-party) challenger, for the simple reason that voting against someone they hate is more important to more voters than voting for someone they like. The most important numbers for Trump aren't ones that might attest to his popularity but those that demonstrate disapproval of Hillary Clinton. Votes against Clinton, in the abstract, could be votes for Johnson or the Kristol candidate, but in practice voters who are serious about stopping Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party will all but inevitably vote for the major-party alternative: Trump and the GOP.

Look again at the list of states where Gary Johnson performed best in 2012: voters in places like Alaska and Wyoming had the luxury of casting their ballots for an exotic species of Republican, called a ""Libertarian,"" because a Republican was sure to win the state anyway. Johnson's 2012 ticket underperformed its national average in states like Ohio, Florida, and Virginia. No battleground state appears in the ranking of places where the Libertarians did best. (A few Democratic states, where again the outcome was predetermined and Republicans might as well vote for a Republican subspecies, do make the list: this explains why Illinois is more Libertarian than Virginia.)

My small-l libertarian friends bristle at being labeled ""conservatives"" or ""Republicans,"" but at the ballot box a difference is hard to discern: the Libertarian Party has never nominated a well-known ex-Democrat to its ticket but has frequently nominated Republicans such as Ron Paul, Bob Barr, Gary Johnson, and William Weld. Wayne Allyn Root, the LP's 2008 vice presidential nominee, is an eager Trump supporter today. And not only the nominees but also the Libertarian Party's voters, to judge by the numbers, seem mostly to be ""alternative Republicans.""

What might seem like a greater threat to Trump is a Kristol candidate targeted specifically at Virginia, whose D.C. suburbs are perhaps the only place in the country where NeverTrump Republicans could make a critical difference in November. (Other states have plenty of anti-Trump Republicans, but those states are so Republican anyway that the defections don't matter, just as defections to the Libertarian Party don't.) Yet it's not clear that there is a Virginia-marketable neoconservative Republican who wouldn't risk taking as many votes from neoconservative-friendly Clinton as from Trump. In Virginia, splitting the vote for war, NAFTA, and more immigration between Clinton and a Kristol candidate might work to Trump's advantage, in much the same way that the divided field in the Republican primaries did.

All this only means that Trump should do as well as Romney did in the electoral college; the alt Republicans and #NeverTrump effort have little chance of costing Trump anti-Clinton votes, which is what most Republican votes are. (One of the flaws in my analysis of the Trump phenomenon early on was that I continued to believe most Republican voters were attached to their party and wanted to nominate someone ""electable""; in fact, a plurality of Republican voters hates the establishment in both parties and wants to take a stand against it, even if that means nominating seemingly ""unelectable"" candidates like Trump or many a Tea Partier.)

Romney fell far short of beating Obama, of course, and since 2012 the country's demographics have only moved further in a Democratic direction, as more millennials come of voting age and the white proportion of the electorate declines. Surely this dooms Trump, even if Republican divisions do not.

Except it doesn't, not by itself. Jamelle Bouie suggests that ""If Trump could reverse the yearslong decline and bring white turnout back to its 2008 levels -- 74 percent -- then he could win with another couple percentage points among whites [more than what McCain received] ... This would give him teetering Democratic states such as New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as the three largest swing states: Florida, Ohio, and Virginia.""

(Higher white turnout in 2016 compared to 2012 strikes Bouie as a more plausible winning scenario for Trump than one in which Trump gets a much higher proportion of a 2012-sized white vote: for the latter to work, he would need ""an increase of nearly six points over the [GOP's] white share in 2012, matching Ronald Reagan's performance in 1984."")

Even where 21st-century demographics are concerned, Trump may have more of a shot than his dismal polling among young people and racial minorities suggests. Clinton is weak with young voters as well, and the tensions between Clinton's establishment liberal supporters and the young left have already led to severed alliances and think-tank purges. Trump has an opening -- if not to add young voters to his older and whiter base then nevertheless to deprive Clinton of their votes by hammering home her failures. And if Trump could win even in the Republican primaries with forceful opposition to the Iraq War and secretive trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) -- causes that resonate with Sanders-leaning young voters -- he stands to do better still with those positions in the general election. Clinton personifies the old consensus that Obama's millennial vote was trying to get rid of when it embraced ""Hope and Change.""

Trump has shown he's prepared to campaign much more aggressively on foreign policy than Bernie Sanders has ever dared. And for a preview of how Trump will perform against Clinton in a debate, just recall how he performed against the GOP's closest counterpart to Clinton: Jeb Bush. Trump will press her hard on Iraq, much harder than Sanders has done. He'll hit her on Libya, too. Trump also won't be any kinder than Sanders has been about Clinton's coziness with the big banks. The young left may be in for a surprise -- one that's unlikely to lead many to vote for Trump but that may drive deeper the generational wedge between them and Clinton.

The 2016 race pits a decades-old center-left establishment against a newly invigorated populist right. That populist right has already defeated the decades-old center-right establishment of the GOP. It has a fighting chance against Clinton, if Trump sticks to his issues and doesn't attempt to become a more generic, Romney-like Republican on questions of war and industrial policy.

As for immigration and ethno-racial politics, there could be some surprises here, too. Trump's critics in the media identify him with the racist and anti-Semitic trolls who support him on Twitter; but millions more Americans identify the Democratic Party with the Social Justice Warriors and other activists whose antics and occasionally violent acts have been widely broadcast on national television over the past two years. If Clinton repudiates this Social Justice left, she risks further alienating her young left base; if she fails to repudiate them, she stands to alienate more of Middle America.

Hillary Clinton represents everything that Trump voters, Republicans, Sanders voters, and Middle America have come to hate: the Iraq War, secretive trade deals and job losses, suffocating political correctness, and the risk of ""unrest."" The liberal establishment in both parties -- free-market liberal in the GOP's case, left-liberal in the Democrats' -- has known all along how much suffering and resentment its policies have generated. But party elites imagined that none of it mattered: what could voters do, pull the lever for Bush instead of Clinton? Clinton instead of Bush? The fix was in, and had been since the first George Bush took office.

Only now, to the insiders' dismay, voters have an establishment and an anti-establishment choice. In 2008 they selected the relatively less establishment figure, Barack Obama, in the Democratic primaries and general election alike. In 2016, voters are asked to cast their ballots for the Democrat who didn't represent hope or change eight years ago. Is Clinton any fresher today?

Trump won't lose any of Romney's states. Can Clinton really hold all of Obama's? Probably not: Ohio still has some white working-class Democrats, and Trump's prospects of winning them seem a lot better than Mitt Romney's ever were. Trump surprised everyone with his successes in Pennsylvania's GOP primary; if he can do five points better than Romney in the general election there, the results will be catastrophic for Clinton. Florida remains as much of a battleground as ever: there's no indication that any trouble with Latino voters will cost him the Sunshine State. This election is as finely balanced and close as 2012 was, and that brings it down to a referendum on the status quo of the last 20 years: should the era of Bush and Clinton continue, or is it time for something new -- even if what's new is named Donald Trump?",https://www.theamericanconservative.com/mccarthy/trump-beats-clinton-the-way-he-beat-bush/,"['Republican', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Republican', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Republican']","['3', '4', '1', '2', '4']"

Supreme Court loses its center

â€¢ For 30 years, Justice Anthony Kennedy has occupied a spot in the middle of the courtâ€™s ideological spectrum, often providing the deciding vote in closely divided cases.

While he lent support to liberal views on gay rights, abortion and the death penalty, he sided with conservatives on voter access, gun control measures and campaign spending by corporations.

3KTCJ4SCVHJE8EQW92H0C4336JA1M7,Morning Digest: Indicted GOP congressman: 'Tell the Navy to go f--- themselves',"Senate

â— AZ-Sen: DefendArizona, which is supporting Rep. Martha McSally, has added another $525,000 to its ad buy against former state Sen. Kelli Ward ahead of next Tuesday's Republican primary.

â— FL-Sen: Florida Atlantic University's latest poll tested the Senate race between Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson and GOP Gov. Rick Scott, and they give Scott a 45-39 advantage. That margin is similar to the 44-40 Scott leads they found in July and May.

â— NJ-Sen: Quinnipiac is out with the first independent poll we've seen here in months, and they give Democratic incumbent Bob Menendez a modest 43-37 lead over wealthy Republican Bob Hugin. That's a considerable drop for Menendez from the 49-32 lead the school found for him in March. However, Hugin and GOP outside groups have been spending heavily against the incumbent, who only went up with his first TV spot days ago. Meanwhile, a super PAC called Leadership Alliance has added $300,000 to a TV buy against Hugin.

New Jersey is usually a reliably blue state, and it hasn't elected a Republican to the Senate since 1972, but this poll is hardly the first sign that Menendez could be in for a rough ride in an otherwise strong Democratic year. While his corruption trial ended in a mistrial in November and the Justice Department dropped all charges not long after, Menendez only won renomination in June by a 62-38 margin against a little-known opponent. Quinnipiac's new poll gives the senator a weak 40-47 job approval rating and a worse 29-47 favorable score. Despite all the ads he's already run, however, Hugin is still largely unknown with a 24-20 favorable rating.

Outside Democratic groups have been running commercials portraying Hugin as a greedy former pharmaceutical executive, and Menendez adopted a similar line of attack in his first TV spot. Menendez used the commercial to argue that while both he and Hugin were raised in Union City, the Republican has forgotten his roots and has become an ally of Donald Trump and wealthy interests.

â— NM-Sen: Relatively little-known Republican Mick Rich has released a Tarrance Group poll to argue he's the more viable challenger to Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich, and his poll has him trailing by 41-34, with Libertarian Gary Johnson in distant third with 19 percent. However, this early August poll came before Johnson joined the race on the Libertarian ticket this month.

Gubernatorial

â— FL-Gov: Democratic pollster SEA Politics has surveyed next week's Democratic primary for an undisclosed client that isn't one of the candidates. Their poll gives former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine a 26-25 edge over former Rep. Gwen Graham, while Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum takes 18 percent and billionaire developer Jeff Greene earns 13 percent. Those numbers are relatively consistent with their poll from last week that had Levine up 27-24 over Graham, but SEA is notably the only pollster to find Levine ahead for the last two months.

Interestingly, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez, who is a Republican, is raising money for Levine, who had supported Gimenez in his 2016 nonpartisan election against another Republican. However, it's unclear if Gimenez will back Levine over whomever Republican nominate if he makes it to the general election.

â— GA-Gov: The RGA's latest TV ad continues their line of attack against Democrat Stacey Abrams over her personal debt issues, hitting her for not paying $54,000 in taxes she owed despite earning $1 million over the last five years and loaning her campaign $50,000. However, Abrams has previously explained that she had reached an agreement with the IRS to defer her taxes while she had to support her elderly parents, including her father's cancer treatments, and had to pay off her student loan debt.

A recent New York Times editorial aptly called this tactic ""debt-shaming,"" and it also reeks of hypocrisy coming from Republicans in this race. Indeed, Republican nominee Brian Kemp himself is being sued for allegedly failing to repay a $500,000 loan for an agriculture business he invested in, making Abrams' debts from student loans and taking care of her family pale in comparison when discussing who is supposedly fiscally irresponsible.

â— IL-Gov: Marist has polled Illinois' gubernatorial election for NBC, and they find Democrat J.B. Pritzker holding a huge 46-30 lead over Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, while Libertarian Kash Jackson takes 6 percent and Conservative Party candidate Sam McCann earns 4 percent. This is Marist's first survey of the race, but every single poll this year has found Pritzker comfortably ahead.

â— MD-Gov: Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has debuted his first general election ad, backed by a $1 million ad buy. The spot portrays his Democratic predecessor, former Gov. Martin O'Malley, as a failure whose taxes hurt Maryland, and Hogan takes credit for repealing O'Malley's unpopular ""rain tax"" on rainwater pollution. Lastly, the governor boasts of having not raised taxes his entire time in office.

â— MN-Gov, MN-Sen-A, MN-Sen-B: Suffolk has polled Minnesota's major statewide contests, and they find Democrats with an advantage in each of them. In the gubernatorial race, Democratic Rep. Tim Walz holds a 46-41 lead over Republican Jeff Johnson. Meanwhile, appointed Democratic Sen. Tina Smith holds a 44-37 edge over Republican Karin Housley in the Senate special election, and Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar is up by a 54-34 landslide over Republican Jim Newberger in the regular Senate election.

â— NM-Gov: We now have the size of the DGA-backed Stronger New Mexico's recent TV ad buy to attack Republican Steve Pearce: $275,000.

â— NV-Gov: Republican Adam Laxalt has been running ads against general election rival Steve Sisolak since the expensive Democratic primary ended in June, and Sisolak's first TV ad isn't set to begin until mid-September. However, Sisolak's allies at Nevada Families First, a group affiliated with the DGA, are giving him some air cover in the intervening time, and they're out with a commercial arguing that Laxalt is in the pockets of the Koch brothers and other members of the oil industry.

The narrator also takes advantage of the tension between outgoing GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval and Laxalt, whom the popular incumbent refuses to endorse, and declares that Laxalt ""stood with the Koch brothers and against Gov. Sandoval to deny affordable health insurance to over 200,000 Nevadans.""

â— OH-Gov: Republican Mike DeWine's first general election ad uses the testimony of a rape survivor to attack Democrat Richard Cordray over how there was a backlog of 12,000 untested rape kits when the latter was state attorney general, an issue that Republicans have used in multiple races in recent years. DeWine's ad implies Cordray was negligent and let hundreds of rapists walk free, and it touts how DeWine eliminated most of the backlog.

However, as Cleveland.com reported, Cordray inherited an office that lacked standard policies for local law enforcement to handle testing the kits, and he had already taken action before his 2010 re-election defeat to speed up the process by making use of robotics. While DeWine is trying to portray himself as the ""law and order"" candidate, it's notable that the typically GOP-leaning Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Cordray, in part because of a report on how most of the special agents at the attorney general's Bureau of Criminal Investigation had been given bulletproof vests that had expired, leading them to file an official grievance.

â— OK-Gov: Former Sen. Tom Coburn, who left the Senate in early 2015, endorsed businessman Kevin Stitt a week ahead of his GOP primary runoff against former Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett. Coburn, who said that the negative ads against Stitt were one reason he was coming out for him, also defended the candidate from attacks on his mortgage company's practices during the Great Recession.

Meanwhile, the pro-Cornett super PAC Oklahoma Values launched a new ad arguing that Stitt ""pumped thousands of dollars into a D.C. political group that propped up liberals Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters."" A pair of early August polls gave Stitt the lead, but we've seen nothing new in weeks.

â— SC-Gov: We have dueling polls in this contest. Democrat James Smith is out with a survey from Garin-Hart-Yang that gives GOP Gov. Henry McMaster a small 47-43 lead. However, while McMaster's campaign has declined to release their own internals, their allies at the RGA unveiled a Tarrance Group survey that has McMaster up 52-41. (We don't have a link to the Tarrance poll, but Post and Courier's Jamie Lovegrove tells us it was in the field Aug. 11-13 and sampled 601 voters.) So far, major national groups on either side haven't been running commercials here.

â— WI-Gov, WI-Sen: Marquette finds two tight races in their home state of Wisconsin a week after the primaries concluded. In the contest for governor, they have GOP incumbent Scott Walker and Democrat Tony Evers all tied up 46-46 among likely voters, while Libertarian Phil Anderson snags 6. In the Senate race, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin edges Republican Leah Vukmir 49-47. Marquette's June poll gave Walker a 48-44 edge over Evers, while Baldwin led Vukmir 49-40.

There haven't been many other recent polls in either contests. A month-old Marist poll had Evers and Baldwin leading by massive 54-41 and 55-38 margins, respectively. Last week, Evers released a PPP survey that gave him a considerably smaller 49-44 lead; that release did not include any Senate numbers.

Marquette has a strong record in Wisconsin, though there's one unusual thing about this poll we want to note. Marquette also released the results among registered voters, and that sample has Walker up 46-44 and Baldwin leading 51-43, respectively. Democrats struggled in 2010 and 2014 to turn out voters for the midterms, but Team Blue seems to have the enthusiasm edge this time around. That makes it a bit odd that Baldwin would be doing noticeably worse among likely voters, especially at the same time that Evers does slightly better.

One thing that's indisputable, though, is that the governor's race will be extremely expensive. The Associated Press writes that the GOP has outspent Democrats $5.4 million to $2.2 million â€¦ and that was just during last week. The RGA has reserved an additional $5.7 million in TV time for the final two months, while the DGA has booked $3.8 million. The Senate race has also attracted plenty of cash, with groups funded by the Koch brothers and megadonor Richard Uihlein outspending Baldwin's allies $4.2 million to $1 million ahead of the primary. However, Baldwin is well-funded herself, and she recently went up with her first spot hitting Vukmir.

House

â— CO-06: While GOP Rep. Mike Coffman has tried to portray himself as a moderate ever since a court turned his formerly red district light-blue in 2011 redistricting, every so often his hardline side sneaks through, and this time it's on immigration. Coffman has publicly espoused a moderate position on immigration, but the Washington Post obtained a recording where he called Donald Trump's DACA policy ""more generous ... than I would [propose]"" at a private fundraiser. Furthermore, the congressman advocated for a ""zero tolerance"" policy on immigration, although it's unclear if he was referring to Trump's abusive family separation policy or other strict immigration measures.

This isn't the first time that congressman has had trouble adapting to his more moderate district, which backed both Clinton and Obama. Back in 2012, Coffman engaged in birtherism and questioned whether Obama was born in America. Additionally, Coffman said, ""But I do know this, that in his heart, he's not an American. He's just not an American."" Undoubtedly, these sorts of statements will give Democrats ample ammunition to try to portray him as too extreme for his swing district.

â— FL-06, FL-17: The With Honor Fund has added another $249,000 into their media buy in support of retired Green Beret Michael Waltz ahead of next week's GOP primary for the 6th District. They're also spending another $85,000 on a TV buy for state Sen. Greg Steube in the GOP primary for the 17th District.

â— FL-27: Spanish-language TV journalist Maria Elvira Salazar is out with a poll from McLaughlin &amp; Associates that gives her a wide 40-16 lead over former Miami-Dade County Commissioner Bruno Barreiro in Tuesday's GOP primary.

While McLaughlin is far from our favorite pollster, we very much believe that Barreiro's campaign is in awful shape days away from Election Day. Barreiro was embarrassed in June when his wife lost the special election to succeed him on the county commission to a Democrat, an upset that flipped the body to a Democratic majority. Weeks later, his own campaign released a poll showing him losing the primary 24-10. All of that unsurprisingly didn't help Barreiro's fundraising, but it's still astounding that he raised just $50 from July 1 to Aug. 8.

â— NY-25: Siena takes a look at the race for this Rochester seat, and they give Democrat Joe Morelle a 55-31 lead over Republican Jim Maxwell. Clinton carried this district 56-39, and no major outside groups have shown much interest in spending here. Meanwhile, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has finally announced that the special election to succeed the late Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter, who died in March, will also be held Nov. 6.

â— NY-27: On Tuesday, the eight local county GOP chairs interviewed nine different politicians who are looking to inherit the GOP nomination from Rep. Chris Collins, who suspended his re-election campaign after being indicted for insider trading. Spectrum News has the names of those would-be nominees: state Sens. Chris Jacobs, Mike Ranzenhofer, and Rob Ortt; state Assemblymen Steve Hawley and Ray Walter; Erie County Legislators Lynne Dixon and Ed Rath; Erie County Comptroller Stefan Mychajliw; and 2010 gubernatorial nominee Carl Paladino.

It may be a while before anyone gets awarded the final rose, however. Erie County party chair Nick Langworthy, whose county is the largest in the district, says they may wait until after the Sept. 13 state primary to officially name someone to replace Collins as GOP nominee, though he adds that they may unofficially designate someone before then.

Still, the GOP doesn't seem to have settled on a strategy to get Collins, who won the GOP nomination in the June federal primary, off the ballot. Langworthy only reiterated Tuesday that he believes there's a way to do it, despite New York's very restrictive election laws. Democrats previously said they'd sue to block any GOP attempt to swap out Collins for someone else.

Primary Recap

â— WY-Sen: GOP Sen. John Barrasso defeated investor Dave Dobson, a moderate who put $1 million of his own money into his campaign, 65-29 in the GOP primary. While Barrasso didn't come anywhere close to losing, however, the University of Minnesota's Eric Ostermeier writes that he did achieve one unwelcome distinction.

While no sitting senator has ever lost their primary in Wyoming history, this was the first time that any had taken less than 70 percent of the vote. The previous low-water mark was Republican Robert Carey, who took 72 percent in 1936. Still, Barrasso is safe in the general election in this extremely red state against businessman Gary Trauner, a Democrat who lost competitive races for the House in 2006 and 2008.

â— AK-Gov: Former state Sen. Mike Dunleavy defeated former Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell, who only entered the race in June, 62-32 in Tuesday's GOP primary. Dunleavy begins the general election as the favorite in a three-way race against independent Gov. Bill Walker and former Democratic Sen. Mark Begich in this red state, and Daily Kos Elections rates this as Likely Republican.

Both Walker and Begich are aware that if they're both on the ballot in November, they could make it incredibly tough for either of them to beat Dunleavy, and Vox reports that their camps have discussed the possibility that one of them could drop out and support the other. This is what happened in 2014 when Democratic nominee Byron Mallott exited the race and became Walker's running mate, which made Walker the de facto Democratic nominee.

However, candidates only have until Sept. 4 to get their name off the ballot. Begich, who entered the race in June, declared this week that he's not going anywhere, and Walker's team hasn't given any obvious hints that he's interested in quitting the race, either.

â— WY-Gov: State Treasurer Mark Gordon defeated conservative megadonor Foster Friess 33-26 in the GOP primary to succeed termed-out Republican Gov. Matt Mead, with attorney Harriet Hageman taking 21. Donald Trump endorsed Friess in a tweet on Tuesday morning about two hours after polls had opened, but it seems he acted too late to shift the course of the race. Gordon is the heavy favorite in this very red state against former state House Democratic Leader Mary Throne, and we rate the contest as Safe Republican.

â— AK-AL: Schools advocate Alyse Galvin won the Democratic primary 54-23, and she will take on long-serving GOP Rep. Don Young in the fall. Galvin still identifies as an independent, but she was able to claim the Democratic nomination because Democratic leaders won a lawsuit earlier this year to allow independents to run in party primaries. Nathaniel Rakich of FiveThirtyEight writes that Galvin will be listed on the general election ballot as an undeclared candidate who was nominated by the Democratic Party.

Galvin has been a good fundraiser, and Young held a modest $435,000 to $256,000 cash-on-hand lead at the start of August. However, while there are signs that many Alaskans are tired of Young, who has served since 1973, he'll be very tough to beat even in a good Democratic year. One of Team Blue's big challenges has been that, while Young only took a bare majority in his last two contests, plenty of anti-Young votes have gone to independent candidates. Young's ability to secure needed appropriations has also given him a strong base of support in heavily Native American areas that usually vote for Democratic presidential candidates.

So far, major outside groups have not purchased ad time here. We rate this contest as Likely Republican.

3KA7IJSNW7NL6F513F2HZKA7X2XBPL,Democratic Candidate Critical Of Trade Deals Advised Companies On Outsourcing,"Suneel Gupta for Congress/Facebook Suneel Gupta is running in a suburban Detroit district where ties to the automotive industry run deep.

Suneel Gupta, a Democratic candidate in Michiganâ€™s 11th Congressional District, today boasts of his record in creating American jobs and blasts international trade agreements for eliminating them. But the entrepreneur wasnâ€™t always pushing that side of the issue.

Earlier in his career, Gupta advised companies on the benefits of outsourcing jobs overseas and even contracted with a foreign firm in a low-wage country to send work there.

When he was employed by the consulting firm Accenture, Gupta contributed to a 2003 report, entitled â€œOutside upside: Finding focus through finance outsourcing.â€

The report, which credits Gupta and another Accenture employee with conducting 20 related interviews, touts the benefits of creating â€œshared service centersâ€ to handle support functions like payroll, accounting and human resources. â€œCosts can be cut further by moving to low-cost sites, such as India, Mexico or Eastern Europe,â€ it says.

The report also has some advice for executives trying to manage the fallout from layoffs or other employment disruptions caused by outsourcing: â€œResistance is to be expected from employees and departments whose jobs are to be transformed or eliminated, and firm, diplomatic management is needed to ensure that the outsourcing provider receives the information it needs to carry on the processes it is inheriting.â€

A 2004 Accenture study, in which Gupta was listed as a contributor, also hailed the benefits of outsourcing, observing that â€œskilled personnel at low-cost locations around the world enable outsourcing providers to offer immediate and substantial cost reductions.â€

That same year, Jane Linder, who collaborated on both those reports, wrote a book based on Accentureâ€™s outsourcing research titled Outsourcing for Radical Change: A Bold Approach to Enterprise Transformation. In the preface, Linder credited Gupta and two other researchers for their assistance.

When HuffPost asked about the reports, Guptaâ€™s campaign argued that while he had conducted interviews for the Accenture reports as a young employee and recent college graduate, the reportâ€™s observations did not reflect his personal views.

â€œHe is vehemently opposed to outsourcing and this assignment helped shape his view that outsourcing is not the way to go,â€ said campaign spokeswoman Kimberly Trent.

On his campaign website, Gupta, now 39, highlights his stint as an early-stage executive at the tech company Groupon, where he helped create â€œthousands of good-paying American jobs.â€

But later, as a co-founder of the nutrition coaching app Rise, Gupta relied in part on overseas labor, contracting with Tooploox, a Polish software development firm, to develop the iOS version of Rise. He spoke favorably about that experience in a review on the website Clutch.

â€œOur team liked working with Tooploox, even though we were skeptical about using an offshore company,â€ Gupta said.

In her candidateâ€™s defense, Trent also distinguished between hiring workers in another country and outsourcing existing American jobs. â€œItâ€™s not as if American jobs were taken away,â€ she said. â€œHe is very proud of his track record here in the United States.â€

During the campaign, Gupta has spoken out strongly against trade agreements that have made offshoring commonplace.

In a video announcing his candidacy in December 2017, Gupta tells the story of his mother and father, immigrants from India who worked as engineers for Ford Motor Company. He is especially proud of his mother, who he notes was Fordâ€™s first woman engineer.

But in 2001, after more than 30 years with the company, his parents were laid off, Gupta says. Standing by a mountain of paper that he identifies as NAFTA and other trade agreements, Gupta says those deals have hurt Michigan workers like his parents.

â€œI canâ€™t find a single thing in here that tells you what to do when your job is shipped overseas,â€ Gupta says as he pores over the papers.

â€œOver and over again, politicians continue to put profits ahead of working families. Thatâ€™s wrong,â€ he continues. â€œIâ€™m not a politician. Iâ€™m an entrepreneur. Iâ€™ve created good-paying American jobs â€• and balanced budgets.â€

Oftentimes, weâ€™re allowing too many loopholes where the incentives are to ship jobs overseas. Suneel Gupta on the campaign trail

In an interview with HuffPost at a Michigan Democratic Party picnic on Sunday, Gupta stressed the need â€œto create incentives to create jobs here in Michigan.â€

â€œOftentimes, weâ€™re allowing too many loopholes where the incentives are to ship jobs overseas. We need to be doing a better job with that,â€ he said. â€œAnd frankly, Trump talked about this. I donâ€™t think that heâ€™s been effective or that heâ€™s moving things in the right direction.â€

Michiganâ€™s 11th District, a GOP-held seat in a gerrymandered arc of Detroit suburbs, is a top pickup possibility for Democrats this November. Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump in the district by less than 5 percentage points. And the districtâ€™s highly educated and affluent population is replete with the kind of moderate Republicans and independents dismayed by Trump who Democrats believe are ripe for conversion.

Whatâ€™s more, the current congressman, Dave Trott (R), announced last September that he would not run for re-election. That prompted the Cook Political Report to change its rating of the district from â€œLikely Republicanâ€ to â€œToss Up.â€

Itâ€™s not entirely surprising then that Democrats have come out of the woodwork to compete in the district. Gupta is one of five contenders in the Aug. 7 Democratic primary.

He is taking on state Rep. Tim Greimel; Haley Stevens, a former chief of staff for the Obama administrationâ€™s automobile company bailout program; Fayrouz Saad, a former immigration director for Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan (D); and climate change activist Nancy Skinner.

As of the end of June, Gupta was leading the field in fundraising with more than $1.3 million raised. He lent himself $150,000 of the more than $400,000 he raised in the second quarter of this year.

But even a hint of past involvement in outsourcing jobs to lower-wage countries could prove a political liability in metropolitan Detroit, where even the white-collar workforce has deep roots in the manufacturing-heavy automotive industry.

Anything that smacks of endorsing jobs leaving the United States does not play well anywhere in the country, but especially not in Michigan. Matt Grossmann, a Michigan State University professor

â€œAnything that smacks of endorsing jobs leaving the United States does not play well anywhere in the country, but especially not in Michigan,â€ said Matt Grossmann, a political science professor at Michigan State University. Attacks on Mitt Romneyâ€™s history of outsourcing were a key part of President Barack Obamaâ€™s 2012 victory in the state, according to Grossmann.

Leading up to the primary, Stevens has emphasized her experience helping to rescue the auto industry, and Greimel has been endorsed by the United Auto Workers, the stateâ€™s most influential labor union.

The most progressive candidate in the field is Saad, a proponent of single-payer health who has the endorsement of the Justice Democrats, a left-wing group best known for helping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez win the Democratic nomination in New Yorkâ€™s 14th District.

But Gupta has pledged not to take corporate PAC money, and he has detailed plans for getting tough with Big Pharma. He promises to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for their role in the opioid epidemic and to crack down on prescription drug costs by closing patent loopholes and empowering Medicare to negotiate prices.

Speaking to HuffPost on Sunday, Gupta projected an air of calm and earnest compassion. He recalled the isolation of growing up as one of the few brown-skinned kids in the Detroit suburb of Novi. His father would call their family â€œfour raisins inside a tub of vanilla swirl ice cream.â€ (Guptaâ€™s older brother, Sanjay, is a neurosurgeon and chief medical correspondent for CNN.)

But any time he felt left out, he said his mother would remind him that â€œwhat makes America special is that we all belong.â€

Gupta said he was inspired to run for office after Trumpâ€™s election because he was no longer sure he could confidently tell his children what his mother told him.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrat-suneel-gupta-trade-deals-outsourcing_us_5b4f6cf9e4b0de86f488fc09,"['Republican', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['1', '2', '2', '3', '3']"
30QQTY5GML2BW8A77KPV4OBAM5D7UU,FULL TEXT â€“ MILO at Cal Poly State University: 'No More Dead Babies',"Welcome to the Dangerous Faggot Tour! Iâ€™m MILO, the supervillain of the Internet, but you already knew that.

Congratulations to the people in the front row who got signed and numbered memorabilia tonight. I look forward to them showing up on eBay. By the way the numbers are edition numbers not ratings. Unlike progressives I donâ€™t go around giving grades to abortions or celebrating the murder of innocent life.

Iâ€™m happy that the final week of my college tour takes place in California. I feel like California is home. Of course Iâ€™m British, but I feel Californian inside. Well, I feel Californians inside.

Is trans-Californian a thing? The beauty of liberal identity politics is if you can imagine it, itâ€™s real, no matter how ridiculous it is! Internet pornography, transgender pronouns, Amy Schumerâ€™s sexuality. You name it.

I donâ€™t blame anyone for being trans-Californian. You have beautiful weather, incredible forests and natural beauty, and plenty of completely insane liberals to laugh at. They say California girls are the best too, but I wouldnâ€™t know anything about that. Because Iâ€™m gay, did you know that?

If I look a bit jumpy tonight, itâ€™s not the protesters that have me on edge. Iâ€™m fresh from an electroshock therapy session. Vice President Mike â€œif you like the cock, you get a shockâ€ Pence sent me a gift voucher for these new Zap The Fag Away treatments theyâ€™re doing at Trump Tower. Itâ€™s like tanning â€” cheaper if you buy a course.

Iâ€™m still hoping the therapy sessions work. I think they might be, itâ€™s early days. Iâ€™m not quite into snatch yet, but I do feel guilty every time I see Idris Elba. Did you know Idris Elba is an anagram. If you rearrange the letters it spells YOU WILL NEVER BE JAMES BOND.

Before we get to the fun stuff, I have an important announcement to make. My initiative to help white men further their education is now accepting applications!

Weâ€™ve given it the brilliant name of the Yiannopoulos Privilege Grant. I put my name in it because progressives are too stupid to remember how to spell it and too lazy to Google, so it reduces the abuse we get in our inboxes by about 90%.

As of this second the website is live for you to apply at privilegegrant.com. My goal is to help more men, no matter what their major or political opinions, to reach their educational goals. You can even major in Gender Studies. I donâ€™t care.

Our pilot grant program will give 10 students $2,500 towards their tuition, which will be paid directly to their college or university. The grant is open for U.S. Citizens attending a 2 year community college or 4 year college or university.

Now the most important details are the dates. Submissions are open today, January 31st, and close February 14th, Valentineâ€™s Day, which is the day fat people stock up on razor blades. So after youâ€™ve finished crying and wanking and thinking about how alone you are, log on to privilegegrant.com and get yourself some free money.

The recipients will be announced on March 31st, and the grants will be paid to the schools immediately upon IRS approval.

Please do not treat this like a college class and open the submission on the last day! Youâ€™ll be writing a mini-essay and providing a video clip of up to 90 seconds via one of several private upload options, so youâ€™re better off starting early.

Although it took longer than I anticipated to get the Privilege Grant set up properly â€” your government bureaucracy is even worse than the UKâ€™s â€” I am happy that we are now well on our way to assisting white men achieve their dreams. I hope everyone eligible in this room and watching our livestream applies!

Males make up only 43% of Americaâ€™s 20.5 million college students. Since the 1980â€™s, women have performed better in high schools and earned the majority of BA degrees.There are thousands of scholarships for women and minorities, but very few for white men.

Education is essential for young men to be successful in the American economy. Young adults with a bachelorâ€™s degree earn 62% more than one with only a high school diploma. The percentage of jobs requiring a bachelorâ€™s degree has doubled in the past forty years.

These facts made it obvious to me that men need education to be successful, and education takes money. We look forward to helping 10 men in the Spring, and many more in the years to come.

Cal Poly is my kind of school. So many universities I visit boast about boring alumni like pioneering surgeons and olympic athletes. But Cal Poly has none other than Weird Al Yankovic!

And it just gets better. The student population is 53% male! Letâ€™s hear it for the sausage party. In fact, women were banned from Cal Poly from 1930 until 1956. For that brief, blissful quarter-century, Cal Poly was a male-only safe space, like a country club or a Saudi Arabian highway.

Now I want you to all be honest with me for a secondâ€¦ whenever there is a feminist protest or genderqueer slut walk or another outbreak of fake rape claims on campus, doesnâ€™t a little piece of you think that letting women back on campus might have been a mistake.

For those of you thinking yesâ€¦. Donâ€™t worry! Youâ€™re not alone!

And for women in attendance, Iâ€™m kidding, slightly. I know you feel the same horror as we do at these ludicrous feminist antics, with additional embarrassment on behalf of your gender. I do recognize it isnâ€™t your fault that you happen to share a gender, one of the actual two genders, with batshit crazy, mean-spirited, man-hating, and deeply unhappy feminist harpies.

There is even more to love about Cal Poly! You have a freedom of speech loving President named Jeffrey Armstrong, who has made the brave decision to take a stand against speech-hating crybabies, and follow the path of the University of Chicago instead of the University of Missouri.

President Armstrong put out a definitive statement about tonightâ€™s event, and hasnâ€™t budged an inch.

Let me quote him here:

â€œIt is, in fact, the universityâ€™s responsibility to support the rights of all people to express their opinions and ideas â€“ regardless of how unpopular they may be â€“ while also encouraging students to think critically and independently.

â€œProtecting freedom of speech is not an option, it is a critical responsibility that the university, and all of us as members of a democratic society, must defend.â€

President Armstrong is right, and the left is absolutely furious. They know they will never win in a world with free-speech, so they fight to censor everything to the right of them.

Itâ€™s the same thing as when these idiots call everyone on the right a Nazi. They even do it to me, but the Nazis hate my guts!

That word used to hold weight, you know.

I am here tonight to talk to you about abortion, and why America must stop murdering babies.

Abortion isnâ€™t the same sort of demonic practise youâ€™d find at one of Hillaryâ€™s spirit cooking sessions, but is no less evil.

Before we talk about some of the serious issues about abortion, we must first touch on my own Catholic faith.

You should always take what I say about religion with a grain of salt, because the 7 deadly sins are more like my seven daily activities. I try to check them all off at least once a day. All of them except gluttony; my trainer keeps that under control.

But I am a Catholic and I do believe in God, even as I recognise that the church is for sinners and Iâ€™m one of the most enthusiastic sinners. As someone once said, I might be bad, but imagine how much worse Iâ€™d be WITHOUT God.

It is in the Bible that we should be fruitful and multiply, I donâ€™t think it mentions shouting our abortions anywhere. This is especially critical at a time western civilisation is in crisis in the face of radical Islam. In short, we need to breed.

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ll finally be caving to public pressure and millions of fan letters and at last auctioning off my sperm for charity.

I once wrote a column wishing we had a religious right movement in the United Kingdom, because religious people there donâ€™t speak up the way religious people do here.

Iâ€™m not going to go on too long about religion because not all of you have the good fortune to be Catholic, or even Christian, but there are a few important points to consider.

Abortion is murder. Abortion is wrong. I think everyone knows that, which is why abortion activists are so angry all the time. Itâ€™s a bit like when you catch someone out in a lie and they get really mad at you really quickly and you canâ€™t work out why until later.

Itâ€™s guilt.

When I say abortion is wrong, its defenders leap to their feet, demanding to know why I want to jail a ten-year-old girl who has an abortion after a horrific subhuman rapes her. Well, guess what? I donâ€™t want to jail that girl, and I defy you to find any opponent of abortion who does.

I will make the distinction for you, because unlike feminists, my audiences are smart enough to enjoy the adventure known as Reasoning With Logic.

I make this distinction, by the way, using the tools of the Catholic Church, which has been reasoning gracefully since long before the first feminist had a hissy-fit. Donâ€™t forget that the original feminists, like Mary Wollstonecraft and Susan B. Anthony, denounced abortion.

In principle, the Church teaches, the direct, intentional taking of innocent human life is wrong. Because thatâ€™s a principle, itâ€™s easy to say that, even in the most heartbreaking case, like that of the ten-year-old weâ€™re considering, it cannot be right to take the innocent life who is growing inside her and has done nothing worthy of the death penalty.

But as Western civilization has always understood, hard cases make bad law. And the Church has long been the enemy of utopianism, the most prominent vice of leftists, who demand that each of us be perfect immediately, according to the warped view of perfection you find in gender studies classes and Marxist gripe fests.

Here is the relevant distinction, and Iâ€™m quoting from the Churchâ€™s â€œAngelic Doctor,â€ St. Thomas Aquinas: â€œHuman laws do not forbid all vices, from which the virtuous abstain, but only the more grievous vices, from which it is possible for the majority to abstain.â€ In other words, itâ€™s not wise to punish with human law everything that may be opposed to the natural law.

That means I can say itâ€™s wrong to take innocent life, without having to say that we should outlaw abortions in every single case. In a sane country, we would argue about what cases should be illegal. Should you, for instance, as often happens in non-Christian lands, allow abortion when parents donâ€™t want a girl baby?

Hereâ€™s one more fact that will help you understand that Thomas Aquinas and the Church arenâ€™t the kill-joy puritans that your lying professors claim: St. Thomas and before him St. Augustine both followed this anti-utopian view Iâ€™ve described when it came to prostitution. They thought it was wrong to do, but foolish to make illegal. I donâ€™t think theyâ€™d approve of rent-boys, so my 20s still require some apologizing for, but it is still an amazingly progressive position,

Sorry feminists. Once again dead white man are clearer thinkers than your leading lights!

Since I brought up catholicism, I have to mention Islam too.

I do this because Islam is always wrong, but I could pacify the liberals in attendance by saying it was mandated by the diversity and inclusion office.

We know abortion for sex selection has been common outside of western civilization. For example under Chinaâ€™s one child policy, many girls were aborted so the family could have a son. By 2001 there were 117 boys born for every 100 girls, leading the government to outlaw sex selective abortions in 2010, and even outlaw doctors telling parents what sex their child would be. Of course it still happens, the Chinese have become skillful at ignoring their authoritarian nanny-state.

But another culture also values sons far more than daughters, and that is Islam. Iâ€™ve said on numerous occasions that if you are curious what effect mass Islamic immigration to the United States would have, all you need to do is look at Europe. And in this case my home country off England is telling.

Statistical analysis of births in England, undertaken in 2014, prove that thousands of girls are being aborted for sex selection purposes.

Of course the government and others will waive their hand and try to explain these things away, but a brave Greek stood up to them.

You probably think I mean me, but there are OTHER brave Greeks, and this oneâ€™s name is Christoforos Anagnostopoulos, a lecturer in statistics at Imperial College London. Damn, I finally have some competition for most ludicrous Greek name.

Christoforos dug into the numbers and found certain incontrovertible proof. Gender imbalances may be contributed to by multiple factors, but no set of factors can explain away the imbalances in immigrant communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan.

To quote him on this subject, â€œThe only readily available explanation that is consistent with a statistically significant gender shift of the sort observed in the census data is gender-selective abortion.â€

Iâ€™m curious how the pro-Islam feminists off England will spin this data. Under Islam, many girl babies literally never see the light of day.

Feminists hate the truth, science, and logical thinking. Third-wave feminism is entirely rooted in lies, distortion, and hysteria. Feminist arguments are absolutely no different.

The underpinning of legal abortion in the United States is the Supreme Court case Roe V. Wade. Many argue that the entire case is shoddy law, but I am not a lawyer and unlike pundits on both sides of the debate, I wonâ€™t argue a supreme court case for your entertainment.

I will share some extremely unpleasant facts that professors and liberals just HATE being shared.

The Roe in the name of the case was actually a woman named Norma McCorvey. Surprise surprise, she is now an anti-abortion activist.

She never had an abortion; the child in the Roe V. Wade case was given up for adoption. McCorvey has three daughters of her own now.

She has admitted, as part of turning against abortion, that the entire case was a sham. In the case she claimed to have been gang-raped by thugs, which was a lie to make the case more sympathetic, like my earlier example.

In fact McCorvey claims that she had minimal involvement in the case besides signing some papers. She was persuaded to play this part by her feminist lawyers.

McCorvey became an anti-abortion advocate after realizing the error of her ways. She bears a heavy heart, as some 50 million babies were legally killed following the passage of Roe V. Wade.

How can feminism be pro-women without being pro-motherhood? There is nothing more unique about being a woman.

But feminism loves abortion, and loves to put down motherhood. Just consider the Womenâ€™s March on Washington. Besides a bunch of women leaving garbage and signs littered all over the city, the prevailing moods were promoting Islam for women, and abortion for all.

Sue Ellen Browder is yet another abortion activist who later became an anti-abortion activist, witnessed firsthand how the sexual liberation of the late 60â€™s and early 70â€™s inserted abortion into the womenâ€™s rights movement.

She eloquently points out that what the media canâ€™t see is that the national debate over abortion is not a war against women, but rather a war between women.

Motherhood and child-rearing became anathema to liberated women, and abortion became a prime component of womenâ€™s rights.

One of the main reasons abortion became synonymous with womenâ€™s rights is the adoption of abortion â€” pun intended â€” into the political platform of the National Organization for Women.

But Iâ€™d like to share a quote from Betty Friedan, who was the President of NOW at the time. In 2001 she said:

â€œIdeologically, I was never for abortion. Motherhood is a value to me, and even today abortion is notâ€¦I believed passionately in 1967, as I do today, that women should have the right of chosen motherhood. For me, the matter of choice has never been primarily the choice of abortion, but that you can choose to be a mother. That is as important as any right written into the Constitution.â€

If she said that in a room of third-wave feminists, sheâ€™d be censored, kicked out, and possibly beaten up. Because feminists arenâ€™t pro-choice, they are pro-abortion.

Initiatives like #ShoutYourAbortion are not about choice, they are about glorifying the death of children. I will leave it up to you to browse that topic for disgusting positive reactions to abortions. They may a good weight loss aide if you eat too much and need to throw up.

But I canâ€™t get away without sharing one vile one at least.

One #ShoutYourAbortion participant gushed that her Vacuum Aspiration made her â€œhappy.â€ That name just â€œticklesâ€ her. Youâ€™re â€œvacuumingâ€ out the â€œunwanted detritusâ€ threatening your â€œaspirations.â€ Itâ€™s like getting blood drawnâ€”sheâ€™s had â€œmore painful experiences flossing.â€

That is what killing a baby is to these people, just a different version of flossing. This quote is in fact a wonderful example of how these despicable people manipulate language to make abortion seem normal. A vacuum aspiration involves inserting a suction device into the motherâ€™s body to suck out the poor little child. Aspiration refers not to the dreams of the mother, but the removal itself.

They do vacuum aspirations when the child is too little to be valuable on the baby bodyparts sales channel. They only want the bigger babies for that â€” so they kill and remove them in completely different ways hoping to preserve the merchandise.

#ShoutYourAbortion and movements like it seek to normalize abortion, but in fact it is very bad for womenâ€™s health. You know, the women feminism claims to care about.

In 2010 the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry published a study based on a sample of 3,000 women in the United States. The findings of the effects of abortion are startling.

59 percent increased risk for suicidal thoughts

61 percent increased risk for mood disorders

61 percent increased risk for social anxiety disorders

261 percent increased risk for alcohol abuse

280 percent increased risk for any substance use disorder

If the cause of this mental anguish were anything besides abortion, women would be marching non-stop against it, and Madonna would be threatening to blow the White House up over it.

Abortion is clearly so bad for womenâ€™s mental health that it falls second only to Islam, and maybe the fact that Iâ€™m gay.

Imagine if the parents of your favorite people in this world deciding against having them.

Abortion is simply wrong.

Imagine no Shakespeare, no Wagner, no Lil Wayne, no Mariah, no Daddyâ€¦

Imagine no Perez Hiltonâ€¦ actually maybe abortion isnâ€™t so bad after all.

Joking!

Abortion advocates ignore science

Feminists donâ€™t really handle science well. They prefer feelings. So it is no surprise their abortion arguments are proven wrong time after time.

Letâ€™s start with the idea that a baby is like a parasite inside the mother, attack her bodyâ€™s integrity. This is what many abortion advocates believe, that the womanâ€™s body is occupied by this hostile force.

Nothing could be further from the truth! In fact, babies pass beneficial cells to their mothers that can aide in healing throughout the motherâ€™s life. A fantastic book has been written on this subject by Jena Pincott called â€œDo Chocolate Lovers Have Sweeter Babies?: The Surprising Science of Pregnancyâ€.

I am a chocolate lover but despite my best efforts and the best efforts of my boyfriend I remain tragically unblessed.

Another argument that we hear all the time is that it is a womanâ€™s body and a womanâ€™s choice.

Women, let us dispel this notion quickly. A baby is not your body. A baby even at a quite early fetal stage has her own heartbeat, her own brainwaves, and her own separate DNA.

How can you possibly argue a baby is part of you? Babies inside their mother have everything but fingerprints and a social security number.

Babies in the womb are the real undocumented Americans we should care aboutâ€¦. Not Mexican gang members and Syrian Jihadists!

Progressives like to insinuate that there is something sinister about Big Oil and Big Tobacco. They might even be right! But Planned Parenthood, Big Abortion, is worse. We were all shocked when undercover tapes came out showing they are in the business of selling baby parts to the medical industry.

Can you imagine, and I donâ€™t think this is a stretch, the senior leaders of Planned Parenthood sitting in a conference room discussing the best timing for an abortion, to maximize their profits from the dead babyâ€™s body? Itâ€™s horrifying, and itâ€™s what feminists want more of.

Planned Parenthood can attribute a good portion of their boffo baby-killing business to their president since 2006, Cecile Richards. Richards is well on her way to personally matching Hitlerâ€™s body count. Weâ€™ve done the grim maths so you donâ€™t have to.

Using a conservative estimate of 300,000 abortions a year â€” or 300 kiloscrapes, using the technical metric measure â€” Cecile Richards has presided over three million abortions, or three megascrapes in her ten years as president of the organisation. This has earned her â€œhalf Holocaustâ€ status. Full Holocaust seems eminently reachable given Planned Parenthoodâ€™s growing hegemony in the abortion industry.

To be clear, this is just since Richards took charge. Planned Parenthood has since 1970 performed 7 million abortions, comfortably surpassing Hitler according to its own annual reports. You have to admire the chutzpah, if youâ€™ll forgive my terminology: Planned Parenthood has amassed a Third Reich-style death count completely legally and while pocketing half a billion dollars a year to do so.

But under Richards the numbers have skyrocketed such that in just the last ten years, at least 3 million young lives were ended. If Cecile stays in her post another decade, she will reach â€œfull Hitler,â€ by matching the six million deaths of the Holocaust. In fact itâ€™ll probably be sooner than that, given the acceleration in procedures during her reign.

The road ahead may be rocky. Besides the undercover videos still being released, some media sources are starting to cover the revolting practices of these sociopathic monsters. Nice normal people, whatever their views on abortion, have no stomach for these unashamed charnel-house activities.

And perhaps President Trump will defund them.

If you need to hear more about Margaret Sanger, hereâ€™s something she once said. She was inarguably racist. She spoke glowingly about a presentation to a group of KKK women in New Jersey, and they loved her messaging about the black race.

Messaging like this, in a letter to Dr. Clarence Gamble:

â€œWe do not want word to get out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out the idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.â€

Notice like most liberals, she considers minorities that disagree with her to be rebellious, or uppity. Black Trump supporters heard these words and much worse during the campaign! Margaret Sangerâ€™s goal was to diminish the black race, and one can argue she was at least partially successful.

Stats about abortion by race are not always easy to find, but nonetheless paint a compelling picture about the race reality of abortion.

New York City presents itself as a strong case study. In 2012, there were more black children aborted in New York City than born alive. More than 31,000 compared to just under 25,000 live births.

Blacks accounted for 42% of the abortions in the city, with Hispanic women accounting for another 31%. Thatâ€™s 73% of all abortions in the city killing black and Hispanic youth.

Other national data from the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform asserts that black women are 3 times more likely to have an abortion than white women.

So isnâ€™t it fascinating that intersectional third-wave feminists fighting for abortion and so often arm-in-arm with Black Lives Matter? To any BLM members tucked away in the audience, I can conclusively say that feminists are one group that do not believe black lives matter at all.

Whether you believe in an immortal soul or not, babies are precious.

You may not like some of the grim imagery associated with the anti-abortion movement, and you may find the pictures of dead babies carried by protesters to be tremendously distasteful, BUT THAT IS THE POINT.

Abortion SHOULD be considered terrible. The left knows it, and that is why they do their best to make people think babies are just lumps of cells that magically become humans upon birth.

They prey on vulnerable women who are pregnant, while at the same time brainwashing the youth to praise abortion.

Iâ€™d like to remind you that many of the great people in history were born as orphans or adopted. People like Julius Caesar, Bach, Steve Jobs, Aristotle, Louis Armstrong, Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Bill Clinton.

What if some of these people hadnâ€™t existed? Donâ€™t say anything about Bill Clintonâ€¦ without him we wouldnâ€™t have had Sick Hillaryâ€™s hilarious campaign!

I call on everyone in this room and the many thousands of people watching at home to reject the cultural conditioning favoring abortion that we are all exposed to. You have already rejected so much, like the lie of campus rate epidemics and the gender pay gap.

Iâ€™m asking you to go a little fartherâ€¦ because Western Civilization needs more babies, not fewer.

David Ramos Contreras, 27, of Mexico, was taken into custody Thursday by the U.S. Marshals Service in Lubbock, Texas, Fox 8 reported. He was reportedly found hiding under a bed, although the exact location wasn't immediately clear.

Contreras, who was reportedly deported from the U.S. in October 2017, will be extradited back to Ohio to face charges.

Contreras, along with Arnulfo Ramos and Juan Garcias Rios Adiel, 19, were sought by Bowling Green Police after two sisters â€” ages 13 and 14 â€” reported on June 28 that the trio, along with a fourth suspect, Simon Juan Thomas, kidnapped and raped them.

Thomas, 24, of Guatemala, was arrested June 29 and charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor.

The girls, who WTOL reported were staying at a Days Inn in Bowling Green â€” where the four men were also reportedly staying â€” were rushed to the hospital for treatment after the alleged attack, and emergency room staff alerted police.

The U.S. Marshals Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force and Bowling Green Police are still searching for Ramos and Adiel, who previously lived in Texas and Florida, respectively.

Authorities are also searching for two women who were seen with Contreras at a Walmart store in Ohio.

Those with information regarding the whereabouts of those sought are encouraged to contact the marshals' fugitive task force at 1-866-4-WANTED or text the keyword ""wanted"" to 847-411.

The Marshals Service has offered up to $10,000 for information leading to the arrests of Ramos and Adiel.

3V0TR1NRVBKUYCEQZHAX1BF6O0VA41,US mid-term elections: What the results mean for Trump,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Democrat Danny O'Connor has not conceded yet in the congressional race in Ohio

Four states held primary elections on Tuesday, but all eyes were on Ohio's special congressional election.

The state has lost a bit of its reputation as a bellwether state, but it was an early harbinger of Donald Trump's 2016 strength in the industrial Midwest. That helps explain why Tuesday's congressional race - the last major special election before November's national mid-terms - was so closely watched.

Although that contest has yet to be decided, there are some lessons to be learned from the race - as well as other results from a busy night in politics across the US.

Another warning bell for Republicans

In Ohio, Republicans were scrambling to boost Troy Balderson to victory and maintain control of a congressional seat they have held for 35 years. The party poured money into the race, Donald Trump held a rally to support the candidate and John Kasich - the still-popular Ohio Republican governor - cut a last-minute television advertisement.

It appears to have been enough - barely - although Mr Balderson only has a 1,754-vote lead with a reported 3,435 provisional and at least 5,048 absentee ballots left to be counted later this month.

Regardless of who wins - and this seat will be up for election again in November - the takeaways are clear. This was a congressional district that Mr Trump won by 11% over Hillary Clinton in 2016. The Republican incumbent, who retired at the beginning of this year, consistently cruised to victory with more than 60% of the vote

This was supposed to be a safe seat - but it wasn't.

The suburban swing

The election results revealed a clear urban-rural divide, as the Franklin County suburbs of the Ohio capital Columbus went overwhelmingly for Democrat Danny O'Connor. Outlying areas backed Mr Balderson, although turnout was well down from 2016.

That's a dynamic that could play out time and time again in November, which could be bad news for Republicans running in key suburban swing districts.

According to the Cook Political Report, there are 68 Republican-held congressional districts less conservative than this one. Democrats have to flip 23 to win control of the House.

Mr Trump, in a tweet (prematurely) congratulating Mr Balderson on his victory concluded by writing that ""November can't come fast enough"".

It's sentiment with which many Democrats will probably agree.

More good news for Democrats

Missouri voters rejected a proposal to pass a ""right to work"" law, which would have allowed employees in union-represented companies to decline to pay non-member dues to support collective bargaining efforts.

The state's Republicans had scheduled the vote during the state's primary, rather than the general election, in the hopes that Democratic turnout would be lower. They were wrong. The measure lost by 35%.

In Washington state, which has a primary system where candidates from all parties compete and the top two move on to the general election, Republicans are also contemplating less-than-encouraging showing.

While all the results aren't in, two Republican incumbents are pulling less than 50% of the vote, including Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the party's congressional leadership. In an open Seattle-area seat that has been held by Republicans since 1983, the party's candidate, Dino Rossi, garnered only 43% against mostly Democratic opponents.

Back in the Republican wave year of 1994, Washington was ground zero for the decimation of the Democratic congressional ranks, losing - among others - the sitting Speaker of the House, Tom Foley.

This year it could help spell Republican doom.

A progressive stumble?

In June, first time candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, campaigning as a Democratic Socialist, shocked the political world by winning a New York primary challenge against a top-ranking Democratic member of Congress.

Critics cautioned not to read too much into the results, however, theorising that Ms Ocasio-Cortez's across-the-board progressive agenda played well in her New York borough district but wouldn't fly in other parts of the US.

That conclusion faced a big test on Tuesday, and the results were a mixed bag.

In the Michigan governor's primary, the highest-profile Democratic race, Gretchen Whitmer comfortably defeated Abdul El-Sayed, who was attempting to be the first Muslim-American governor in US history.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez and progressive icon Bernie Sanders had both campaigned for Mr El-Sayed in the run-up to the election, but their support ended up being not nearly enough.

The progressive duo also campaigned for labour lawyer Brent Welder, but after a long night of vote-counting he narrowly fell to Sharice Davids, who was backed by a powerful women's political group.

Elsewhere in Michigan, Rashida Tliab - who was backed in a crowded field by Justice Democrats, the same political action group that boosted Ms Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive candidates - won her primary and is virtually assured of being the first Muslim-American woman in Congress.

Even if some progressives stumbled on Tuesday, however, the party as a whole - including more traditional ""establishment"" candidates - continues to move toward widespread support for policies like universal healthcare and debt-free or no-tuition college education. Even in losing the battles, the Democratic left appears to be winning the war.

Trump's primary power

Donald Trump's overall popularity with the US public may be mired in the low 40s, but he's approaching record levels of support within Republican ranks.

That approval once again translated into an ability to move votes through his primary endorsements - as it had in recent contested races in South Carolina, Alabama and Georgia.

In Michigan on Tuesday, his chosen candidate to challenge Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow cruised to an easy win. In Kansas Kris Kobach - an early Trump backer who chaired the president's now defunct election fraud commission - is locked in a tight, yet-to-be decided race against incumbent Republican governor Jeff Colyer.

Many Republican Party elders had urged Mr Trump to stay out of Kansas, believing Mr Colyer - who had been appointed to fill a governorship vacancy - would be the better general-election candidate. The president rewarded Mr Kobach, an outspoken advocate of conservative immigration reform and voting restrictions, for his loyalty with a coveted endorsement, however.

It may end up enough to tip the scales in his favour.

The year of the (Democratic) woman

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The ""Pink Wave"": How women are shaping the 2018 US elections

Another round of primaries, another round of wins for women candidates - particularly among Democratic ranks.

Democrats have now nominated women for at least eight of the 36 governors elections this November (Republicans have selected three).

Tuesday's balloting also ensured a record number of major-party women candidates running for the US House of Representatives, at 185 - besting the previous mark of 167 with many primaries left to be held.

The #MeToo movement that broke on the national stage last year appears to be exerting a gravitational pull on US politics, although the true test will be not in nominations secured but political offices won in November.

Need a break from conventional journalism? We took nine subjects and put them into unconventional forms: a song by Ben Folds about Rod Rosenstein, an investigative poem about fracking, a Betsy DeVos board game and much more.

Listen to Mister Peepers Illustration by Vasava Studio Lyrics below

MISTER PEEPERS God bless the bureaucrat and the lawyer, too Theyâ€™re public punching bags But someoneâ€™s gotta do it Itâ€™s not so sexy, the procedure or the truth I say God bless the bureaucrat and the lawyer, too The House Intelligence Committee piles on Theyâ€™d love to know what Rosenstein has on the boss But itâ€™s just for cameras, yeah, itâ€™s just a show of force Yâ€™all know he canâ€™t comply But thatâ€™s the point, of course So they call him Mister Peepers As the thugs all smash his glasses Going full Lord of the Flies Burning this island down to ashes Whatâ€™s the rule of law if we canâ€™t agree on what a fact is? There ainâ€™t nothing here to see, folks, move along, move along Thank God for facts Theyâ€™re stubborn things indeed But little cowboys will try cases on TV It doesnâ€™t make it so Because you make believe You canâ€™t lose in court and appeal on Hannity The distinguished wrestler from Ohio Heâ€™s free to lie, heâ€™s not the one whoâ€™s under oath The law donâ€™t suit the boss This Deputy must go We got him in the locker room, boys Start the show So they call him Mister Peepers Send some thugs to smash his glasses If heâ€™s gone and peeped the wrong thing Then theyâ€™ll burn his name to ashes Whatâ€™s the rule of law If we canâ€™t establish what a fact is? There ainâ€™t nothing here to see, folks, move along, ah move along They say it dies in the dark Right now, theyâ€™re trying to kill it in broad daylight Can flashlights really fight bombs? Weâ€™ll see Right now You boys are Christians, right? What would Jesus do? Would he bury crimes and carry water like a stooge? Or smear a family man in case he tells the truth About the boss? Yeah, what would Jesus do? Would he call him Mister Peepers? Send some thugs to smash his glasses? The institutionâ€™s standing tall Though we tried our best to trash it Arenâ€™t we all the keepers Of this fragile young Republic? And when all those Mister Peepers people fallâ€¦ Lord help us all So what happened when we reached out to a famous musician for a contribution to this issue? We got a song about Rod Rosenstein, of course. Ben Folds was interested in our idea of combining journalism with pop music, and it was new territory for him as well as us. We discussed a range of possible subjects, but by that point Rosenstein already had a grip on him â€” for reasons that come through in his lyrics. We paired him with a reporter who sent him regular updates on Rosensteinâ€™s role in the Mueller Russia probe. One particular detail that interested Ben was that President Trump had allegedly referred to Rosenstein, to aides, as Mr. Peepers, because of his glasses. That imagery, in turn, led Ben to a character from literature known for his vulnerability. â€œI think the first thing that came to my mind was images of â€˜Lord of the Flies,â€™ â€ Ben says. â€œI thought of the thugs that break the little kidâ€™s glasses.â€ Rod Rosenstein as Piggy, in a sense. Ben worked this into the song, using him in a way, as songwriters do, that wasnâ€™t intended to be literal. â€œNow that weâ€™ve established the glasses as simple imagery to tie you into â€˜Lord of the Flies,â€™ now theyâ€™re what you see things through. Do we want this guy seeing facts?â€ He was drawn to the deputy attorney general, Ben explains, â€œbecause of the personal position heâ€™s been put in and the position that weâ€™re in at these crossroads, where we find ourselves deciding to stick up for our norms â€” or not.â€ The Washington Post Magazine asked Ben Folds to write a song about anything. He chose Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

Supervision, nostalgia, drama: A play in three acts, by Amanda Long. Illustration by Eric Giriat. Read the script

How do you write a nonfiction play? It all starts with the right subject. As writer Amanda Long discovered, the experiences of chaperones at a prom â€” a setting where adults are both looking out for the next generation and reflecting on their own youth, a place where past and present waltz together â€” can make for a poignant, theatrical script. Amanda zeroed in on her characters at T.C. Williams High Schoolâ€™s 2018 prom as soon as she got there â€” observing the scene and asking them questions, separately and together, in between their official duties as chaperones, while also listening to their conversations with one another. Everything everyone says or does in this play is what happened, though editing helped to give the acts and dialogue shape. Proms have certainly changed over the past generation â€” smartphones, selfies â€” but there are also ways in which one of the most dramatic nights of any teenagerâ€™s life has remained completely the same: the thrill of dressing up, the pageantry of growing older. And this, too: the worry of adults, as well as their cherished memories. â€œProm Chaperones: A Play in Three Actsâ€ CAST ERIN HUDSON 35, history teacher ALICIA CORDERO 35, English and leadership teacher MATTHEW HENRY 41, English and leadership teacher TAMMY IGNACIO 51, lead administrator for Operations and Student Services SETTING At the Hyatt Regency Crystal City in Arlington, Va., for the T.C. Williams High School senior prom. Teachers and other school employees are volunteering to help the event run smoothly. TIME 7 p.m. Saturday. ACT I Teachers and administrators from the school gather in the atrium lobby, as a steady mist falls outside and early arrivals slowly trickle in, gathering in clusters, readjusting straps, posing for pictures and swapping out wet shoes for dry ones. ALICIA What I remember most about my prom was my dress. It was a dream come true: sparkly teal, fake-diamond-encrusted, some unfortunate amount of crinoline. I was not ready to say goodbye to it for a long time. My junior year of college, I walked around in it for a full day. Did the dishes, did the laundry. I needed to have a moment, to thank it and, hey, I was happy I could still fit into it! Then I took it to Goodwill. MATTHEW I left prom after about 30 minutes to go to the clubs in D.C. My friend and I went to the bathroom in the lobby to change and ran right into the principal on the way out. He said we looked nice and asked where we were headed. We named the club that everyone knew was the most all-age friendly. We did not go there, but we did go to other clubs. We had a blast. TAMMY It was the â€™80s, so you can imagine my dress. I looked like Mary Poppins! I had a hat. A hat! And a full hoop skirt. There wasnâ€™t an inch of skin showing. ERIN It was such a fun night. I went with all my girlfriends, so none of that relationship drama, just all of us together, excited in that way only teenage girls can get. I remember looking forward to it so much and wanting it to go well so badly. Getting ready for prom is a full-day event. And thatâ€™s as much a part of the fun. MATTHEW I was walking down Mount Vernon Avenue about 9 a.m., and the hair salons right on the strip were already full of kids getting their hair done. ERIN We are just hoping their hair holds; itâ€™s so humid and rainy. Thatâ€™s our fear. Truly. They try so hard. They pay so much money. Itâ€™s a big deal. Our school only has a senior prom, so this is likely the only time many are going to get to even go to a prom. You just so hope that nothing goes wrong, even if itâ€™s just getting your hair rained on. MATTHEW My advice to other chaperones? Remember this is not about you. Youâ€™re here to help them have an unforgettably good time. Thatâ€™s it, not to relive your prom. ERIN Iâ€™ve seen chaperones do it all kinds of ways. Some go the â€œwhole nice Sunday church dress look,â€ while others go all out, almost formal. MATTHEW Some want to outdo the kids. ALICIA Actually â€” surprise â€” itâ€™s not about you! MATTHEW Right, itâ€™s not your night. I mean, itâ€™s your money if thatâ€™s how you want to spend it. But thatâ€™s not what we do. The fact that my shirt is tucked in is a big deal. ERIN You know, though, I never get this dressed up at school. [Gestures toward her black dress and not-so-little black heels.] They never see me like this! Itâ€™s fun to see their reactions, though. Itâ€™s our way of showing them that theyâ€™re worth the effort â€” that prom is worth all this. These shoes are not for me. Theyâ€™re for you, kids. MATTHEW Last year, one of my kids was like, â€œDang, Mr. Henry. You look gooooood. I should have asked you to be my date!â€ ALICIA [Deadpan.] Um, no. Thatâ€™s illegal. Lights dim. ALICIA I most definitely remember my first time chaperoning. I was working at the check-in table, so I got to see every single kid arrive. I got to see every one of my students looking their best, so beautiful. I was literally taking photos the whole time. I needed to document my kids going to prom. ERIN Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been looking forward to the most: seeing my kids, my babies, and the transformation. ALICIA They told us not to do that in college â€” to call your students â€œyour kids.â€ When you spend more hours in a day with them than their parents do, they do kind of become your kids. A student, an early arrival, approaches. STUDENT NO. 1 Hey, Mr. Henry. The chaperones erupt in proud exclamations over his T-shirt-to-tux transformation. ALICIA Oh, look at how sharp we are. Give me a turn. Give me a turn. Oh, there you go. The student obliges. MATTHEW I think Iâ€™ve seen you dressed up for no more than half a day. You should do this more often. STUDENT NO. 1 Thanks. Is the prom this way? The teachers nod and point in the direction of the escalator to the lower lobby, where the ticket table and ballroom await. ERIN I donâ€™t have any kids of my own, so maybe it would be different. Your own kids need to take precedence. Iâ€™d have their events to be a part of, but I donâ€™t know if theyâ€™d always want me there. The kids are actually excited to see us â€” their teachers â€” at prom. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the same when youâ€™re their parent. TAMMY My daughter is in there somewhere. I have instructions to stay away, and Iâ€™m going to honor them. Itâ€™s not easy having an administrator as a mom â€” especially here at the prom. A cacophonous entourage descends the escalator, filling the lower lobby with whoops, hollers and camera flashes. We had a photographer come to the house. My daughter did the T.C. Williams colors theme: red, white and blue. Her dress is red. Her date is wearing navy with a red tie. I helped her pick out the dress. Iâ€™ve seen the changes gradually. It was harder for her dad. The transformation was all at once. MATTHEW The next time they get this dressed up â€” for most of them â€” is their wedding. You canâ€™t help but think of that when you see someone in a tux whom youâ€™re used to seeing in sweats. This may be just another Saturday night to you, but this is likely the fanciest theyâ€™ve ever been. ALICIA Prom is a glimpse into their future. ACT II The teachers move closer to the escalator in the atrium as attendees arrive and need to be corralled toward the lower level. MATTHEW Our biggest worry, honestly, is the death of a student. I know that sounds morbid. Itâ€™s not unheard of. It is prom. Thatâ€™s the thing you donâ€™t want the most. ERIN Literally the things I tell all my kids about prom is be safe and make good decisions. MATTHEW We say it all the time. As they walk out the door, thatâ€™s the last thing they hear from us: â€œMake good choices.â€ ALICIA Part of our role is to show them how adults can go out, have fun, and it doesnâ€™t have to involve drinking. MATTHEW We hundred-percent do not endorse them getting rooms here, but we canâ€™t stop it. ALICIA We donâ€™t endorse it and we donâ€™t ask about it. I donâ€™t want to know because I canâ€™t do anything about it. MATTHEW When I was in high school, we rented an entire hotel floor one year, and all the things I donâ€™t want to picture these kids doing? Yeah, that all happened. Lights dim. At the bottom of the escalator, in the lower lobby. TAMMY A car accident is the thing I fear the most, but itâ€™s the easiest one to avoid. Thereâ€™s absolutely no reason anyone should drive a car tonight! Uber! Taxi! Call your ... [She stops and rushes toward a girl who is smiling and waving as she prepares to exit the escalator.] Your train! Lift up your train! [The girl does so, and a wardrobe malfunction is averted.] That right there is quickly becoming my second-biggest fear: a dress getting caught in the escalator and pulling its owner down with it. MATTHEW Homecoming is where the drama is. So many more kids. So many underclassmen. I mean, in terms of chaperoning, itâ€™s all hands. We donâ€™t get as many volunteers for chaperones at homecoming. With 2,000 kids in the school gym, itâ€™s all hands on deck. But I think most staff like to chaperone prom because itâ€™s not as crazy. ERIN I havenâ€™t chaperoned homecoming for years because at my previous job I saw things I didnâ€™t want to have to police on a Saturday. Plus, itâ€™s at the school. The expectation is lower. Youâ€™re at your first high school dance. Youâ€™re emotional. Seniors, well, they know whatâ€™s next. Graduation. Adulthood. ALICIA And since everyone goes, it gets more complicated. Thereâ€™s more of that, â€œYou said we were a couple, so why are you here with her?â€ MATTHEW Social media is the biggest difference. We didnâ€™t have any of that; we didnâ€™t have to worry about any of that. ALICIA There are some pictures of my prom that I found when I was moving recently, and I am so very thankful that theyâ€™re not out there. ERIN Every adult I know says, â€œThank God my prom wasnâ€™t on Facebook.â€ MATTHEW There is one photo of my prom. One photo. Thatâ€™s all the evidence that exists of my prom. ERIN They really donâ€™t have any idea of how big of an impact social media will have, how it never really goes away. MATTHEW It just keeps them from being in the moment. ALICIA Itâ€™s not all of them. About 10 to 15 percent of the kids do know how to live without it. Or theyâ€™re making a conscious effort to at least try. ACT III Just inside the revolving doors of the hotelâ€™s main entrance. The time is 8:30. Erin remains to greet the last students. A group of girls who were in her AP class last year enter, and when they see her they start jumping around in excitement. She takes their pictures; they take pictures of her. They huddle so Erin can take a group selfie. ERIN I love that the pressure to come as a couple is gone. When I went to prom, it was just all my girlfriends. And now I see my girls coming in and, well, it just makes me happy. I know that sounds sappy. But seriously, I teach 11th grade, so this is the first year my students are at prom. They were taking my picture. They were like, â€œMiss Hudson, you look so good. I am so glad youâ€™re here!â€ And I was like, â€œYou look amazing. I canâ€™t believe you think Iâ€™d be anywhere else!â€ I remember those teachers who truly connected with me, who were interested in my life beyond those four walls. Thatâ€™s the kind of teacher I want to be. If you canâ€™t be there for your kids beyond those four walls, youâ€™ll never truly connect. She pauses to fully appreciate a pair of royal blue, very sparkly, seemingly dangerous loafers with spikes worn by a male student who approaches. [To student.] Look at your shoes! Do they hurt? I mean, does it hurt to touch them? What are you going to do when your date needs to take off her heels and she has to avoid getting hurt by your spiky shoes? These are the things you need to think about. Lights fade. Ticket table, lower lobby. Matthew, Alicia and two other chaperones take tickets and IDs from attendees, dispensing compliments and reminders to vote for king and queen. ALICIA You know how we avoid king and queen drama? Google! Students vote tonight as they enter. We do that on the Google Forms platform, so we get the results automatically. No one can stuff the ballot. I no longer have to sit here and count. I know Google is taking over our lives, but I approve in this case! MATTHEW It can get pretty cutthroat â€” not so much at prom, but definitely at homecoming. But, yeah, it can get competitive. In 2015, there was some campaigning at prom, and the girl who thought she was going to win, who everyone kind of presumed would win, showed up late. Really, she showed up two minutes before we stopped letting kids in. And the girl who did all the campaigning won. The other girl was so gracious about it. This yearâ€™s prom queen is a late arrival to the ticket. When Alicia and Matthew notice a lack of entrants to be queen, they encourage a leadership student to run. When she emerges from the ballroom, she wears an incredulous grin, sash and tiara. You won! You won! You look so happy! ALICIA Come here! We need a group hug. We need pictures of all of us. They hug and take selfies. The queen returns to her friends. MATTHEW Sheâ€™s just a very, very nice girl. You just have to love when a very, very nice girl becomes queen. ALICIA Whereâ€™s the prom king? MATTHEW He already left. Oh well. Lights fade. The night starts to wind down, and a growing number of students gathers just outside the ballroom entrance, near the coveted outlets. They sprawl out on the floor and stay close to the wall to keep their phones plugged in. STUDENT NO. 2 We should just go, you know? Weâ€™re all kind of over it, and we should leave when everyone is still in a good mood. Her group stays put. MATTHEW [Exiting the ballroom, raising his voice.] Iâ€™m looking for a kid wearing a Batman mask. Has anyone seen a kid in a Batman mask? He took it from the photo booth, and they want it back. VOLUNTEER NO. 1 I told him he needed to make sure that a mask was okay with the principal, but I havenâ€™t seen him since. Maybe check the bathroom. MATTHEW Iâ€™m not chasing him down in the bathroom. If someone taking a Batman mask from the photo booth is the worst thing that happens tonight, we are good. We are all good. Lights fade.

James Comeyâ€™s book tour: A poem by Robert Pinsky. Reporting by Katie Zavadski. Illustration by JÃ¶rn Kaspuhl. Read more

Listen to Robert Pinsky read â€œThe Signingsâ€ Lies can be charismatic, the truth is cloudy, With its traditional testing place a body. I cross my heart and hope to die. The breath, One hand on the book, one raised, exhales the oath. The bully making a club of the victimâ€™s hand, â€œYou hit yourselfâ€: Falsehood asserts Command. Mortgage papers declare and hereby pledge That money is money. Sign here, page after page. The President holds up for the cameraâ€™s eye A paper with his signature, two inches high. Times when he lied or cheated, the Director Made longhand notes. Now the Directorâ€™s an author On a bookstore tour. He produced his clunky book Himself. No ghost. In a defensive joke At signings a writer I know likes to set up A jar he labels â€œFor Tipsâ€: wry overlap Of Truth, Marketing and Art. Any collector Knows to pay less for copies with a signed sticker Than one with its title page directly signed: Authentic, true. But on the other hand, Inscribed to someoneâ€™s name is somehow worth less Than simply Signed, out here in the marketplace â€” But why? The blemish of the particular? Or truth too a commodity? Flailing for air. My poem â€œThe Signingsâ€ comes from a unique collaboration, arranged by The Washington Post Magazine, between reporter Katie Zavadski and me. Our subject: James Comeyâ€™s book, â€œA Higher Loyalty,â€ and his book tour. Katie attended the New York and Washington events on that tour, interviewed attendees and followed the coverage. After we had a couple of brief telephone conversations, Katie sent me a polished piece, in effect an excellent feature article balancing sympathy and judgment. That was the basis for â€œThe Signings.â€ Like me, Katie has her viewpoint. One of her sentences crisply described Comeyâ€™s project as â€œMisguided but honest, and hellbent on honor, unlike the circle of assent that surrounds Trump.â€ As I began working on my poem, with her work as a starting point, I thought about book tours and the ritual (familiar to me) of the signed copy as bodily evidence of an encounter. Katieâ€™s words â€œhonestâ€ and â€œhonorâ€ made me think about the relation of authorial book signings to signed and notarized legal documents, and to oaths uttered or documented. I was struck by Katieâ€™s description of the bodily line sitters, hired to save a place in the queue, and her account of people who got on the line early, as if they were true fans, so they could buy signed copies to sell for a quick profit on eBay. I had read that the word â€œtestimonyâ€ is related to â€œtesticles,â€ with ancient Roman witnesses required to swear on that part of the body. Line sitters, copy sellers, testes: All of this material suggested ways the elusive quality of truth can be pursued (or claimed) by using the human body. Katie notes Comeyâ€™s uninspired, derivative writing about the presidentâ€™s physical appearance. She observes that in those passages Comey echoes not only much of the standard derision of Donald Trump, but also the substandard derisory style of Trump himself. Her evaluation of Comey as a writer resonates, in the poem, with my adjective â€œclunky.â€ Katieâ€™s compact phrase â€œmisguided but honestâ€ and her evocation of the sometimes weird manners of bookstore â€œeventsâ€ â€” is the author a rock star or a lecturer? â€” led me to the â€œdefensive jokeâ€ of a writer I know, setting up a tip jar at the table where he signs copies of his book. In the Venn diagram of â€œTruth, Marketing and Art,â€ the first two of those realms convincingly overlap in Comeyâ€™s undertaking, with Trumpâ€™s diagram including only one of the three. With his tip jar my friend strives for all three: acknowledging the truth that he is marketing his art. Iâ€™m grateful to Katie Zavadski for her concise, alert reporting. I hope that â€œThe Signingsâ€ achieves reporting of its own kind, by telling what I see in the current news â€” for example, in the third couplet, about the kind of lie that intends not to deceive, but to assert the liarâ€™s power: Command that doesnâ€™t bother to deceive, but asserts itself as above obedience to truth. â€” Robert Pinsky More from the Magazine: How robo-callers outwitted the government and completely wrecked the Do Not Call list This â€˜hillbilly madmanâ€™ is country music royalty.

The national duckpin bowling championship, in verse. Poem by Gene Weingarten. Reporting by Rachel Manteuffel. Illustration by Mikel Jaso. Read more

Rachel Manteuffel: The first day of the National Duckpin Bowling Congress Tournament, I met a man who had taken up duckpin bowling after coming home from fighting in World War II, and I met a female bowler who was born in 1999. The continuous sound of the bowling machinery is like cutlery in an industrial dishwasher. Two men who repaired the foul-line buzzer had done this together for so many years they used a shorthand that they could not actually explain when it was read back to them verbatim. They fixed the buzzer just fine. With the regular way of reporting a feature story, the way Iâ€™m used to doing it, about 8 percent of what you observe will actually make it into the published text. You find out which 8 percent when you sit down to write. With this one, it was more like one-tenth of 1 percent was going to matter, and it was out of my hands entirely which bits those would be. It was terrifying and a tremendous relief... Gene Weingarten: After spending 27 hours reporting her story over three successive weekends, Rachel did the job to which sheâ€™d been assigned: She delivered her raw notes to me, 2,500 words that tried to answer the question: What Is the Meaning of Duckpin Bowling? My job, to which Iâ€™d been assigned, was to reduce her notes to 350 words â€” as a poem, it would have to try to answer the question: What Is the Meaning of Life? I thought this was the worst assignment I ever had, until Rachel and I got to talking... Behold! Weâ€™re at a duckpin bowling tourney In County Page, Va. (pop. 23,726). From Washington, a two-plus-hour journey To see this dying sport of bucktoothed hicks. But wait! These people here, they arenâ€™t bumpkins! Theyâ€™re folks who love this game, and hereâ€™s the crux: Theyâ€™re rolling balls the size of pygmy pumpkins At pins the shape of plump and squatting ducks. They learned it from their moms and dads and grannies. They treasure most this legacy, their past. And though these weathered lanes have nooks and crannies The balls roll flat and true and fine and fast. So let us now reflect a bit upon it: Duckpin bowling â€” You deserve a sonnet. Say hi to T-Bowl Lanes in Shenandoah, Near Luray Caverns (calcite, they are rich in). Machinery seems near as old as Noah, Youâ€™d see this stuff in Alice Kramdenâ€™s kitchen. The gears and belts are creaky, but theyâ€™re fine Until theyâ€™re not. Scott Hensley ambles in: He tinkers, making ancient things align. Till theyâ€™re humming â€™midst that bowling alley din. The winning prize? A couple hundred bucks. Which barely covers entrance fees and so. Rhode Islanders have driven up in trucks. Most everyone is losing lots of dough. Why isnâ€™t duckpin bowling dead and gone? A sort of love is helping it limp on. No one makes these gears and belts today: The market for spare parts is nonexistent. So scrounging has become the only way â€” And scroungers are determined and persistent. Duckpin lanes are going straight to pot â€” Fewer and fewer houses yet remain. Old Fredericksburgâ€™s is now a parking lot! Duckpinners are a dying breed, itâ€™s plain. The winner of this tourneyâ€™s seventy-six. But Jeffrey Ferrand rolls a mighty ball. Still, itâ€™s fair to ask, while down here in the sticks â€” Does duckpin have a future now at all? To live and love and in this life to thrive? Denial is our main tool to survive.

367O8HRHKHQYY80KGHWOMB9CA624SR,Republicans have a Kobach problem and like Trump it's not going away soon,"CLOSE Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer says he will endorse Republican nominee for governor Kris Kobach. He conceded in the state's GOP primary a week after voting ended. Kobach had President Trump's endorsement. (Aug. 15) AP

Kris Kobach's race for Kansas governor will be a window on whether chicanery, vote fraud nonsense and a Trumpy persona are still winners with voters.

President Donald Trump has many imitators, but they do not include his voter fraud and immigration adviser Kris Kobach. Heâ€™s more the presidentâ€™s predecessor than his clone.

Trump flipped off his partyâ€™s poobahs to endorse Kobach in the Kansas gubernatorial primary. On Tuesday night, a week after the contest, Kobach finally became the Republican nominee.

It's no wonder the presidentâ€™s affinity for Kobach got the better of him. The Kansas secretary of state is a regular John the Baptist of flim-flam. Heâ€™s the original Javert of voter fraud and such a forerunner on feeding animus against immigrants that he was down on them them before it was cool.

While Trump was still a Democrat in 2004, Kobach ran for Congress on cracking down on immigrants. Kansans, who werenâ€™t sure they should worry too much about that issue, chose the far more moderate Democratic incumbent, Dennis Moore. Two years later, Kobach started helping officials in Maricopa County and the state of Arizona draft the controversial laws that were the first in the nation to make being undocumented a state and local crime.

Conflicts of interest, claims of vote fraud

Stylistically, Kobach also mirrors the Trumpism he presaged. So loose on the stage he debates like heâ€™s doing a lounge act, and so fond of stunts he parades around with a big fake machine gun, heâ€™s certainly as polarizing as his ally in the White House.

And heâ€™s just as cavalier about potential conflicts. At first, he said there was no reason he couldnâ€™t oversee the possible recount that was expected right up to Gov. Jeff Colyer's concession Tuesday night. Then, while still insisting that â€œit really doesnâ€™t make any differenceâ€ if he supervised his own recount, he passed on that responsibility to his deputy, solving nothing.

Early on Election Day, some brand new voting machines in the moderate Kansas City suburbs in Johnson County didnâ€™t work. Some people waited so long to cast a ballot that they finally gave up and left without voting. And it took the county all night to report results.

In response to the news that the secretary of stateâ€™s office had recorded vote totals from some counties incorrectly, Kobach suggested out of nowhere but his own rucksack that non-citizens might have voted in the primary.

More: The Russians are hacking. Luckily Trump voter fraud commission isn't in charge.

Losing the November elections might be the only way to save Republican Party

Trump's rude he-man act is catnip to his fans. They don't care that he's putty for Putin.

Colyer then accused Kobach of further sowing chaos by misinforming counties that they should ignore mail-in ballots with smudged postmarks. â€œIt has come to my attention,â€ Colyer said in a letter, â€œthat your office is giving advice to county election officials ... and you are making public statements on national television which are inconsistent with Kansas law and may serve to suppress the vote in the ongoing primary election process.â€ For mild-mannered Colyer, this amounted to a cursing spree.

And if you thought maybe you heard laughter wafting across the plains, that was the sound of bipartisan Kansan howling after Kobach accused his far more by-the-book competitor of making the state look bad with all of his inflammatory talk.

Yes, that reminds you of someone.

But in a state where voters overwhelmingly preferred Bernie Sanders to Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz to Trump, itâ€™s still not clear that Kobachâ€™s natural Trumpitude is a plus.

Failures and chicanery exposed

In the closest gubernatorial primary in Kansas history, Kobach barely beat Colyer, who had to split the ""Please, God, not Kobach"" vote with two other Republicans. Colyer had his own baggage â€” he served as lieutenant governor when Sam Brownback was governor, and was tainted by the disaster of the Brownback tax cuts. Yet itâ€™s Kobach who was considered the weaker opponent for Democratic nominee Laura Kelly.

His national voter fraud commission has been debunked and decommissioned. Key provisions of his Kansas voter ID law have been found unconstitutional by a judge who literally sent the former constitutional law professor back to school for a continuing ed law course.

His history of chicanery is out now, too. A recent exposÃ© by my colleagues at the Kansas City Star and ProPublica shows he enriched himself by convincing small towns across the country to let him help them draft and defend anti-immigrant ordinances. Only, these laws didnâ€™t hold up in court and cost the cities millions to defend.

In solid red Kansas, Kobachâ€™s antics and bad lawyering have worn thin even among Republicans. If Colyer had ended his political career, it would have been a real public service â€” not just for Kansas but for America. Still, for obvious reasons, Kansas Democrats were pulling for Kobach to win the primary.

There's always a risk in getting what you wish for, and in this case that risk is Greg Orman â€” an independent candidate who could draw votes away from Kelly. But for now Democrats' only regret is that the vote count took just a week, since every day it dragged on was another dayâ€™s head start.

30U1YOGZGBEBY4JD9SXHPF3INAIDSI,I'm a Judge Who Decides if Children Should Be Separated from Abusive Parents. Here's How Trump's Immigration Policy Should Change,"In my 15 years as a judge in Texas, I have presided over many hundreds of child welfare cases. I have frequently had to decide whether to remove a child from their parent. Even when the parent has abused or neglected the child, these can still be extremely difficult decisions -- with significant weight and manifold considerations that underlie them. This is why I am so appalled by the Trump Administration's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy that resulted in the separation of thousands of children from their parents at the U.S. border -- with no due process and no judicial oversight. Despite the President's political damage-control via executive order and the Customs and Border Protection commissioner's announcement that the policy has been suspended, many legal and practical obstacles remain for families at the border, especially for those already separated. While we address their urgent needs, we must also repair how this nation treats children.

Child welfare judges spend a great deal of time listening to the stories of the children in our cases. Some of the most valuable lessons I have learned as a judge have come directly from my experiences with these children. I share some of them here in hopes that our nation, policymakers and those on the ground working with these families can learn from them.

Separating children from their parents can be more traumatic than abuse or neglect. Of the thousands of abused and neglected children I have served over the years, it is the rare child who does not tell me they would prefer to go home and reunify with their parents. That longing is so strong in many children that during the separation period, I have seen them lose all hope, shut down emotionally, act out aggressively or sabotage their own safety by running away or cutting themselves. One foster youth on my docket managed to maintain high grades at school while living in a very chaotic and unhealthy home with parents who were suffering from mental illness and using drugs, but her academic performance rapidly deteriorated after she was removed from her parents to a foster placement that met all of her basic needs like shelter and food and clothing. Knowing removal from an abusive parent is so traumatic, I cannot fathom how much more traumatizing it must be when a child is removed from a parent who has sacrificed so much in search of a better life for their family. It is widely accepted by child welfare experts that removing children from their parents to an unfamiliar environment with strangers traumatizes them -- it should be avoided except where necessary.

Kids will not just 'grow out' of childhood trauma. One of the questions on the ten-question Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) survey, which measures traumatic experiences early in childhood and their long-term consequences, asks, ""Before your 18th birthday, was a biological parent lost to you through divorce, abandonment or other reason?"" Studies have identified a direct link between a person's ACE score and adult chronic illnesses, as well as emotional and social issues such as depression, domestic violence and suicide. It is essential that our government provide the kids at our border appropriate social services and therapeutic interventions which may help mitigate the effects of traumatic experiences.

Place each child in the most family-like environment possible. When a child must be removed from their home, they should be placed with grandparents, aunts, uncles, godparents, or prior babysitters -- someone the child already knows and feels safe with. When no such option is available, the child should at least be placed in a home environment with a licensed foster parent trained in childcare and trauma. Even then, judicial oversight continues to encourage and order frequent visits and contacts with all but the most unfit parents within a very short time after removal. Separated children should not be housed in cage-like holding cells or abandoned storefront buildings along with hundreds of other traumatized and removed children.

Do no harm. Some individuals, including the President of the United States, have stood back and coldly cast fault on the immigrant parents for unlawfully bringing their children across an international border. They say that these children and parents are not entitled to due process because they are invaders of our country. This argument is a distraction. Each month in my jurisdiction, the state files dozens of new civil legal petitions seeking to protect children and possibly remove them from abusive parents. As a judge, I cannot control what arrives on my desk for review. I simply have a duty to move forward by reviewing each of these cases swiftly and carefully with an eye for the best interest of the children involved. As the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, an organization for which I used to serve as President, declares in its ""Enhanced Resource Guidelines"": ""[J]udges serve as leaders in the court and child welfare systems and should embrace the precept 'first, do no harm'."" It is not our job -- nor should it be anyone's -- to stand back and use the court system to shame the parents and undercut their rights and those of their children.

Children have constitutional rights. As the U.S. Supreme Court said in 2000, ""Constitutional rights do not mature and come into being magically only when one attains the state-defined age of majority. Minors, as well as adults, are protected by the Constitution and possess constitutional rights."" Those rights include due process. It's quite simple.

Childhood will not wait. For an adult, a year or two may seem to pass by in the blink of an eye, but for a child it is an eternity. Childhood is fleeting. Children in foster care who visit with me in my chambers have described the agony of counting the days until they can just ""go home"" and ""just be a regular kid."" It has been over 20 years since Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, which mandated deadlines that would keep kids from spending their childhood in temporary foster homes; every child at the U.S. border deserves this protection. These children should not and cannot wait for the contentious and laborious wholesale overhaul of our country's immigration policy, which our Congress has been working on for years. By then, their childhood will be over and the lifetime damage will be done. If anyone deserves action and due process, it is the innocent children arriving at our borders today.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/apos-m-judge-decides-children-152559583.html,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic']","['5', '5', '5', '5', '5']"
35F6NGNVM91WWVVI7FZLZSP83ITT7U,The gap between the rich and poor is widest among Asian Americans,"

A man watches as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) greets people in San Francisco's Chinatown in June 2016. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)

Income inequality has risen steadily among all Americans since the 1970s. But the gap between rich and poor has grown the fastest â€” and is the widest â€” among Asians, who have displaced blacks as the most economically divided racial group in the United States.

The finding, in a report released Thursday by the Pew Research Center, paints a more complex economic portrait of Asian Americans than is often captured by snapshots showing Asians at the top of the income ladder.

While Asians as a whole rank as the countryâ€™s highest-earning group, economic gains for lower-income Asians between 1970 and 2016 trailed far behind those made by their counterparts in other racial and ethnic groups, the report said.

â€œAsians are often depicted as the highest-achieving group in America, but itâ€™s clear they are the most economically divided, with a significant share of Asian Americans lagging well behind lower-income whites,â€ said Rakesh Kochhar, a senior researcher at Pew.

Rising inequality among Asians, the countryâ€™s fastest-growing minority, can be largely explained by immigration patterns and the diverse reasons immigrants from an array of Asian countries settle in the United States, Kochhar said.

Immigrants, largely from China, India, Korea, the Philippines and Vietnam, accounted for 81 percent of the growth in the Asian adult population between 1970 and 2016. Nearly 80 percent of Asian adults in 2016 were foreign-born, compared with 45 percent in 1970.

Asian immigration surged after the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which favored family reunification. The end of the Vietnam War in 1975 brought a wave of refugees. One result, the report said, was that the share of new Asian immigrants working in higher-paid, high-skilled jobs dropped between 1970 and 1990.

A new wave of Asian immigrants came to the country after the 1990 Immigration Act that sought skilled workers during the tech boom. Many of the latest arrivals came from India, initially under the high-skilled Hâˆ’1B visa program.

â€œAsian Americans come from a wide range of countries and cultures with different assimilation trajectories,â€ Kochhar said.

[Same family income, same street, but the black boy still grows up to earn less]

Three-quarters of Indian adults in the United States have at least a college degree, compared with less than a third of Vietnamese, less than a fifth of Laotians and Cambodians, and about half of Chinese, Pakistanis and Filipinos.

Median household income varies from $100,000 among Indians to $36,000 among Burmese. Poverty rates among Asians are as high as 35 percent among Burmese and 33 percent among Bhutanese.

Income distribution among Asians has gone from being one of the most equal in the United States to being the most unequal over the past five decades, the report said. During that time, the gap in the standard of living between Asians near the top and the bottom of the income ladder nearly doubled.

In 2016, Asians in the top 10 percent of income distribution earned nearly 10.7 times as much as Asians in the bottom 10 percent. In 1970, the wealthiest Asians earned 6.1 times as much as the poorest Asians.

[White people are really confident that things are getting better for black people]

Among all Americans in 2016, the wealthiest earned 8.7 times as much as the poorest â€” a steady but more moderate increase in the wealth gap from 1970, when the wealthiest Americans earned 6.9 times as much as the poorest.

The income of the highest-earning Asians â€” those in the top 10 percent â€” nearly doubled from 1970 to 2016 to $133,529, the most of any group. Asians in the bottom 10 percent increased their earnings by only 11 percent during this time to $12,478 â€” less than the earnings of lower-income whites, who made $15,094 in 2016.

But researchers do not expect the gaping income divide among Asians to last, because of changing immigration patterns.

â€œYou will eventually end up with a more settled native-born Asian American population,â€ Kochhar said, â€œso the rapid rise in inequality in this population may be a transitory story.â€

3MZ3TAMYTM5G50ZMMHYNQ2EZTA5IRT,Illegal Alien Accused of Murdering Mollie Tibbetts Has an Anchor Baby,"The illegal alien accused of murdering 20-year-old college student Mollie Tibbetts and leaving her body in an Iowa cornfield has a U.S.-born child.

This week, law enforcement announced that Tibbettsâ€™ body was found in a cornfield in her rural hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa, after she was last seen jogging on July 18.

Illegal alien Cristhian Bahena-Rivera, a 24-year-old from Mexico, has been charged with first-degree murder in her death after police say he admitted to confronting and chasing down Tibbetts. The illegal alien lived in a region of Iowa that was surrounded by sanctuary cities, as Breitbart News noted.

Police have previously noted that Bahena-Rivera has been living in the U.S. illegally for the past four to seven years. A new report reveals that the illegal alien has a U.S.-born child with one of Tibbettsâ€™ former high school classmates.

The children born to illegal aliens are often referred to as â€œanchor babies,â€ as they are able to eventually bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. and are given birthright citizenship. Every two new immigrants to the U.S. brings an estimated seven foreign relatives with them. Anchor babies also allow illegal aliens to permanently stay in the U.S. as they can claim that they have American citizen children.

In 2015, a classmate of Tibbettsâ€™ had a child with Bahena-Rivera. Reports from Bahena-Riveraâ€™s first day in court after being charged with first-degree murder in Tibbettsâ€™ death revealed that the former classmate was in the courtroom with a child in her arms.

Bahena-Rivera was able to make a living in the small Iowa town by holding a job at Yarrabee Farms, a dairy farm in the region. The farm owner originally said that he used the E-Verify system to check whether Bahena-Rivera was an illegal alien, saying that he passed the screening. Later, the farm owner admitted that E-Verify was not used to check the immigration status of the illegal alien.

The illegal alien used a stolen or fake ID and fraudulent Social Security card to work in Iowa. His attorney has attempted to stop the government from calling Bahena-Rivera an â€œillegal alien,â€ claiming that he has legal status to be in the country. Federal immigration officials confirmed to Breitbart News that Bahena-Rivera is, in fact, an illegal alien.

37NXA7GVSUOAO8O9G40AJFVUVNELVB,Good News! Freedom-Hating UN Harpies Hate America,"As we approach Christmas, we remember in story and song the three wise men who visited the newly-born Jesus and brought him gifts of gold, frankincense, and the other one, acknowledging him as King of Kings.

One international organisation made a grotesque mockery of the festive tale this month by dispatching three brainless, finger-wagging harpies with wisdom of a gold coin wrapper to tell America how utterly reprehensible its commitment to freedom and liberty really is. The only gifts these disapproving scrooge-like schoolmarms bore were socialism, the promise of financial collapse and a lower standard of living for Americans.

If youâ€™d happened upon the grim spectacle of fainting-couch feminist bores in scarves and problem glasses visiting Planned Parenthood clinics and bossing everyone about, bleating about how bad America is for women, youâ€™d likely have figured they were gender studies professors from an Ivy League university. Or senior advisors to the Hillary Clinton campaign, perhaps. Your mistake would be understandable. As it happens, the women are from a global body more often invoked at Halloween than at Christmas: the United Nations.

The three unwise women hail from Costa Rica, Poland, andâ€¦ the United Kingdom. I know, I know, Iâ€™m sorry. Essentially the third woman has come knocking to tell the US it is time to emulate the success of the UK, where boys are killing themselves at the same time colleges refuse to acknowledge the male suicide epidemic.

I know what youâ€™re thinking! â€œMilo, you handsome, talented, loquacious, witty, successful and popular devil, the United Kingdom is your beloved homeland and a first-world nation!â€ Well. Iâ€™m sad to say the UK has bought into the UNâ€™s garbage for years and has morphed into a place I barely recognise.

But all is not lost. As the headline above subtly indicates, the withering judgment of these harbingers of gloom â€” they were reportedly â€œappalledâ€ by Americaâ€™s lack of gender equality â€” is fantastic news. I should say, by the way, in reference to that headline, that I have no idea whether these women are rug-munchers for sure. Call it an informed guess, based on that Howard Stern look.

If the United Nations doesnâ€™t approve of America, it isnâ€™t too late. A healthy nation is one the UN scolds and holds in low regard â€” which basically just leaves America and Israel at this point. Remember, these are the masters of perspective and ethical deliberation who consider Saudi Arabia an appropriate country to join their Human Rights Panel. I wish I were joking.

The UNâ€™s delegation visited Alabama, Texas, and Oregon. Itâ€™s no surprise they hated Alabama, which has enjoyed a renaissance, thanks to the automobile industry, and Texas, which I prefer to call â€œReal America.â€ But it should be telling to Americans that they were even unhappy in Oregon, called by some â€œThe Peopleâ€™s Republic of Oregonâ€ thanks to its reliably left-wing leanings.

Some of their findings wonâ€™t surprise you. They harp on about the gender wage gap, which has been thoroughly debunked by Christina Hoff Sommers and at this point is not widely believed by anyone outside of liberal politics and Marxist college student unions. They also arenâ€™t happy with the treatment of female illegal aliens in detention centres. It is typical UN pretzel logic to say female illegal aliens should receive better care than Americaâ€™s homeless veterans, but nothing we havenâ€™t heard before.

They report being called â€œchild murderersâ€ when entering an abortion clinic by protesters exercising their right to free speech. Granted, the protestors shouldnâ€™t have been so hasty. The UN retinue could merely have been entering the clinic to purchase dismembered baby parts skilfully removed intact by doctors who supposedly at one point took the Hippocratic oath to â€œdo no harm.â€

The UN fussbuckets point out they are obviously past child-birthing age, when they express surprise at being called child-killers. But I wonder if theyâ€™re missing the point? I reckon the protesters were commenting on the obvious chilling effect these women have on international birth rates by killing the male sex drive stone dead. Think of all those poor women in Alabama whose husbands came home last Tuesday and said: â€œSorry love, Iâ€™ve got a headache.â€

Gender warriors continue to hurt their case by coming across as sociopaths when they claim violence against women is somehow special and more serious than that against men. The fact is, violence against men is far more common, far more deadly and a far more economically urgent problem to address.

They are also in love with social welfare and maternity benefits, which have been a handy tool in bankrupting Europe. Millions of women in the US give birth and then make the decision whether they want to re-enter the workforce, work part-time, or stay at home. This shouldnâ€™t be the governmentâ€™s decision. Making it so will only further hurt an economy that continues the weakest recovery on record.

Inevitably, our merry band of professional grievance mongers referred to protests outside the abortion clinic they visited as â€œterrorism.â€ Aside from this gross debasement of the language, this is a glimpse into what the UN really thinks: free speech is intrinsically terrifying, and as we saw with their laughable and since retracted report on â€œcyber violence against women.â€

The three horsewomen of the feminist apocalypse say they were mystified as to why women seem to like America. So let me spell it out for them. America is still the land of opportunity for women and men from all nations. Any Polish and Costa Rican woman would gladly come to America for a better life, and, although it pains me to say it, I suspect English women will not be far behind.

Because third-wave feminism believes that all gifts must flow from state coffers, it cannot appreciate why brave, hard-working female doctors, entrepreneurs and others might want to come to a place that will reward the value they contribute to the economy.

Theyâ€™d rather America was like Sweden, where they say all the right things about feminism, even if uncontrolled immigration and lies about crime have made MalmÃ¶ the rape capital of Europe, as hordes of Muslim migrants rape Swedish girls with impunity. Just as long as every child gets a free â€œMEN SUCK!â€ leaflet from the government.

I understand the Grand Grievance Tour continues, and these three stunning and brave specimens are now off to speak to Obamaâ€™s people about what a terrible place America is. (Obama no doubt agrees.) So for now weâ€™ll have to warm ourselves with anticipation at the publication of their full report in June 2016 â€” just in time for liberal politicians to shove the dodgy stats, special pleading and professional victimhood down the necks of so-called â€œlow-information voters.â€

Anyway, as I say, well done America. If the UN hates you, youâ€™re on the right track.",https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2015/12/16/great-news-freedom-hating-lesbianic-socialist-harpies-from-the-un-still-hate-america/,"['Strongly Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Republican']","['1', '2', '3', '3', '2']"

WOODLAND PARK, N.J. â€“ A longtime Rutgers University history professor could be facing disciplinary action after an investigation by the university concluded he violated its discrimination and harassment policy when he posted on Facebook that he hates white people, a comment he argues was â€œsatirical.â€

Rutgersâ€™ decision, the professor says, threatens the tradition of academic freedom at public institutions. But the university argues it needs to maintain a discrimination-free environment.

The professor, James Livingston, a white man living in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, said he was commenting on gentrification in his neighborhood when he posted on Facebook on May 31. But the post was perceived as discriminatory by the universityâ€™s internal investigation.

â€œOK, officially, I now hate white people,â€ Livingston wrote. â€œI am a white people, for Godâ€™s sake, but can we keep themâ€”usâ€”us out of my neighborhood?â€

Aug. 22: 'It's not embracing diversity:' School criticized for sending black girl home over hair extensions

He wrote the post after visiting Harlem Shake, a casual burger diner on West 124th Street.

â€œThe place is overrun with little Caucasian (expletive) who know their parents will approve anything they do,â€ he continued. â€œI hereby resign from my race.â€

Livingston, a tenured professor for 28 years, has taught at the university since 1988.

He faces an unknown future at Rutgers, including possible discharge.

On his behalf, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) has asked Rutgers in a letter to reverse its conclusion that he violated policy. The letter also argues that he has the right to his opinion as a private citizen.

â€œAllowing human resource administrators to tell a professor of 30 years what he can and canâ€™t say on Facebook means that the tradition of academic freedom in our public universities is essentially over,â€ Livingston said in a statement.

A Rutgers spokeswoman said the faculty and staff have that freedom â€” but not when it comes to discriminatory remarks.

â€œRutgersâ€™ position on free speech is clear: All of the members of our community, including faculty and staff, are free to express their viewpoints in public forums as private citizens,â€ said Dory Devlin, director of media relations. â€œYet, at Rutgers University, we also must foster an environment free from discrimination, as articulated in our policy prohibiting discrimination.â€

Livingston did not respond to requests for comment.

The Facebook fallout

After the initial post in May, Livingston received about 230 threats of physical violence and derogatory name-calling through his Rutgers faculty page and Facebook, he said in his Aug. 8 appeal of the universityâ€™s investigation.

He claimed in his appeal that the threats came from â€œoutraged members of the alt-right.â€

Rutgers also received complaints about his post and demands for action through its anonymous compliance hotline, emails and calls.

According to its investigation report, someone wrote to the university: â€œI have two kids and I would never send them to a university that employs someone that has such a one-way attitude towards race.â€

Livingstonâ€™s original post was blocked by Facebook. Facebook alerted him at the time that it violated its community standards. Still, Livingston wrote follow-up posts reiterating his comments.

â€œI just don't want little Caucasians overrunning my life,â€ he wrote. â€œRemand them to the suburbs, where they and their parents can colonize every restaurant.â€

He said in his appeal that the â€œsatiricâ€ comments were about a broader issue of gentrification, the process of rebuilding rundown urban communities, which causes rents to go up, creating a neighborhood of more affluent residents.

â€œSpeaking as someone who has spent forty-odd years researching and writing about American history, these are, as the letter of determination acknowledges, matters of ongoing intellectual debate,â€ Livingston said in his appeal.

Carolyn Dellatore, the associate director of employment equity, conducted the investigation.She said the universityâ€™s mission to educate a diverse student body has been disrupted by his public statements, since Rutgers received numerous complaints.

Although the posts were on Livingston's personal social media account, discrimination or harassment doesnâ€™t need to occur in the physical confines of the workplace to be actionable, Dellatore said in the report.

In its memo on the investigation, the university concluded that Livingstonâ€™s statements â€œwere clearly insulting and degrading to Caucasians,â€ and that he â€œexercised astonishingly poor judgment in his choice of words.â€

The university argued that his statements put the universityâ€™s mission at risk since â€œa reasonable student may have concerns that he or she would be stigmatized in his classes because of his or her race.â€

After an investigation finds a faculty member guilty of violating policy, the next step is to consider whether disciplinary action, including discharging, will be taken, according to the policy.

â€œIf they impose any discipline on him, Rutgers University would be sending a really dangerous message that outsiders and internet outrage mobs can control the narrative: Target a professor and elicit a response from a public institution,â€ said Marieke Tuthill Beck-Coon, litigation director at Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.

â€œI regret that my remarks were misinterpreted,â€ Livingston said in his appeal. â€œTo suggest otherwise â€” in other words, to accuse me of racism â€” is to act as a committee of hanging judges, rather than to acknowledge that human communication is always imperfect. The benefit of the doubt applies here, too.â€

He has written at least five academic books, including â€œOrigins of the Federal Reserve System: Money, Class and Corporate Capitalism, 1890-1913,â€ and â€œPragmatism, Feminism and Democracy: Rethinking the Politics of American History.â€

There have been other recent cases of racism and anti-Semitism reported on campus, including white supremacist flyers and swastikas on buildings. Last year, a professor, Jasbir Puar, published a book accusing Israel of ""what amounts to a modern blood libel,"" said Andrew Getraer, executive director of Rutgers Hillel.

Previously, the Political Science Department employed Mazen Adi, a former spokesperson for the Syrian government of Bashar Assad, to teach international human rights law. Adi also had voiced support for the thoughts spread by Puar ""that Israel harvests Palestinian childrenâ€™s organs for some nefarious cause,"" Getraer said in December.

According to Rutgers officials, Adi has not been employed by the university since summer 2017. Puar remains on staff as an associate professor in the Department of Women's and Gender Studies.

3XDJY5RK5T3EDLSO5MRO1CR0V3N4U7,Germany migrants: Protesters face off in Chemnitz,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption People were injured as objects were hurled on both sides of the protests

Rival protests over a murder in the east German city of Chemnitz have ended with several people injured as objects were hurled by both sides, police say.

Far-right activists had gathered in the centre for a second day as a Syrian and an Iraqi remained under arrest on suspicion of Sunday's deadly stabbing.

Anti-Nazi activists rallied just metres away, accusing the far right of using the death for political ends.

Injuries were caused when protesters on both sides threw objects, police say.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel had warned that ""vigilante justice"" would not be tolerated.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption ""Nazis, no thanks"" reads a flag carried by a counter-demonstrator in Chemnitz

Police warned masked demonstrators who were picking up stones in the city, about 200km (120 miles) south of Berlin, that their actions were being filmed.

Earlier, authorities said police were investigating alleged assaults on an Afghan, a Syrian and a Bulgarian during the unrest that broke out on Sunday.

Reports have included mentions of protesters chasing foreigners, though there are few details.

Chemnitz police, quoted by the local broadcaster MDR, said: ""We did not anticipate such a total of participants [on Sunday]"".

Bigger crowds thronged the city centre on Monday. MDR estimated the far-right turnout to be 5,000, with some 1,000 leftists opposed to them.

What happened on Sunday?

It is unclear what triggered a fight which reportedly preceded the stabbing, at about 03:15 (01:15 GMT) on Sunday, on the sidelines of a street festival.

The far-right demonstration in the city centre on Sunday caused the festival to be cancelled abruptly.

The stabbing victim, a carpenter aged 35, was critically wounded and died in hospital. He has been named as Daniel H, who had a German mother and a Cuban father.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Tributes to the dead man continued to be paid on Monday

Two other German men with him, aged 33 and 38, were seriously hurt, police say.

The Syrian detainee is 23 and the Iraqi 22.

Police have denied rumours on social media that the fight was linked to the sexual harassment of a woman.

A half-Cuban woman who grew up with Daniel H, Nancy Larssen, told Deutsche Welle news that media misreporting had helped fuel the ""horrible"" far-right protest.

""It's sad that in the media they're just saying that a German has died, and that's why all the neo-Nazis and hooligans are out, but the media should describe who died, and what skin colour he had, because I don't think they'd be doing all this if they knew,"" she said.

Another friend of Daniel H, quoted by the Chemnitz news site Freie Presse, described him as left-wing, with a seven-year-old son.

How did protests spread?

Initially, about 100 people gathered on Sunday for a rally which passed off without incident, AFP news agency reports.

However, some 800 people later gathered at the Karl Marx monument, a focal point in the centre of Chemnitz.

The monument is a throwback to the city's days as a model socialist city in the former German Democratic Republic, when it was renamed Karl-Marx-Stadt.

Freelance journalist Johannes Grunert told Spiegel Online he had witnessed some protesters using bottles to attack people ""who did not look German"".

Image copyright AFP Image caption Riot police were deployed in Chemnitz on Sunday

Pegida, the far-right street movement, called for a new demonstration on Monday afternoon, while an MP from the far-right political party AfD, Markus Frohnmaier, tweeted: ""If the state is no longer to protect citizens then people take to the streets and protect themselves. It's as simple as that!""

""Today it's a citizen's duty to stop the lethal 'knife migration'!"" he wrote, alluding to the influx of migrants in recent years. ""It could have targeted your father, son or brother!""

As the heap of wreaths and candles at the spot where the murder occurred grew larger on Monday evening, right-wing demonstrators massed at the Marx monument, and counter-demonstrators gathered close by.

Police reported some Hitler salutes among the far-right crowd, who held anti-immigration placards with messages like ""Stop the asylum flood"".

""That has no place in our cities and we, as the German government, condemn it in the strongest terms. Our basic message for Chemnitz and beyond is that there is no place in Germany for vigilante justice, for groups that want to spread hatred on the streets, for intolerance and for extremism.""

Martina Renner, an MP for the radical Left party, accused the far right of seeking to exploit the murder for political ends.

""A terrible murder, the background to which is still unclear, is being instrumentalised in the most repugnant way for racist riots in Chemnitz,"" she said in a tweet.

Why is the migrant issue so thorny?

In 2015, Chancellor Merkel decided to let in a record 890,000 asylum seekers. Syrians fleeing the civil war comprised the biggest group - a 403% rise on Syrian arrivals the previous year, the German migration office reported.

She and her allies were punished by voters at last year's general election, when the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered parliament for the first time, winning 12.6% of the vote and more than 90 seats.

3J5XXLQDHNTT84YKAYWANT1DVYL3V7,Brett Kavanaugh: Trump Supreme Court pick under microscope,"Image copyright Getty Images

The reality television show drama is over. Donald Trump has unveiled his new Supreme Court pick. Now the debate about Brett Kavanaugh - his merits as a judge and his future on the court - can begin.

Mr Kavanaugh has served as a circuit court judge for 12 years, giving him a lengthy legal record for supporters and critics to pore over. Given that a number of major cases loom on the Supreme Court's horizon, his views and positions - and how he might vote on the closely divided court - will be closely scrutinised.

Here are four areas where the new nominee might feel the most heat.

Abortion

Upon news that Mr Kennedy was retiring, liberals and legal commentators were quick to warn that the legality of abortions across the US hangs in the balance

The Reagan-appointed justice had been one of five votes effectively upholding the landmark Roe v Wade decision in 1992, In 2016 he was the decisive vote striking down stringent Texas regulations that would have shuttered all but a handful of abortion clinics in the state. Depending on whom Mr Trump picked, those types of laws could proliferate - or Roe v Wade itself, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalised abortion nationwide, could be overturned.

Social conservatives were pining for a more clearly anti-abortion choice, like Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Mr Kavanaugh's nomination gives them some reason for pause. While he disagreed with a circuit court decision allowing an undocumented immigrant teenager in government detention to seek an abortion, in the mind of anti-abortion advocates he was not sufficiently forceful in his dissent.

In another case, Mr Kavanaugh sided with a group of priests who did not want their government-mandated healthcare plans to offer contraception - but, in his opinion, he noted that the government had a ""compelling interest"" in providing such insurance coverage.

One anti-abortion group, the American Family Association, is on the record opposing his confirmation - and others have expressed some displeasure.

On the other side of the political divide, abortion rights groups have been sharply critical of Mr Kavanaugh. They point to his use of the term ""abortion on demand"" in his decision on the teenage immigrant as an example of his endorsement of anti-abortion language. And virtually any Trump pick was going to be attacked, given that the president explicitly promised during his campaign that he would pick Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v Wade.

On the Docket: It probably won't be long before the truth about Kavanaugh comes out. An Iowa law banning abortion once a foetal heartbeat is detected - as early as six weeks into pregnancy - is already being challenged in court and could work its way up to the Supreme Court in just a few years.

It's the kind of case that could give anti-abortion activists a chance to realise a dream decades in the making - for decisions on the legality of abortion to once again rest in the hands of state governments, not courts.

Presidential power

As a long-serving judge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over a range of cases involving the federal government, Mr Kavanaugh has had plenty of opportunity to weigh in on questions involving presidential authority and powers.

In January, he dissented from a decision upholding a law that prevents a president from removing the head of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau - a government agency created during the Obama administration to oversee the credit card, student loan and mortgage industries - ruling that it was a violation of executive authority.

Perhaps most noteworthy, in 2009 Mr Kavanaugh penned an article for the Minnesota Law Review in which he argued that Congress should pass a law shielding presidents from civil lawsuits and criminal prosecution while in office.

""The president's job is difficult enough as it is,"" he wrote. ""And the country loses when the president's focus is distracted by the burdens of civil litigation or criminal investigation and possible prosecution.""

On the Docket: It doesn't take an enormous stretch to imagine where this sort of logic could come into play. There are already rumours aplenty that Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign could be considering obstruction of justice charges against the president. Such a move would almost surely lead to a legal challenge that ends up before the Supreme Court.

In one final ironic twist, Mr Kavanaugh was an assistant to Ken Starr's long-running investigation of President Bill Clinton in the 1990s - and back then he helped argue that the then-president could be subject to criminal charges.

Immigration

Mr Kavanaugh was reportedly the preferred choice of White House adviser Stephen Miller, the iron fist behind Mr Trump's immigration policy. That should speak volumes about how the administration views the new nominee's position on this hot-button topic.

In particular, immigration hardliners point to a 2014 Kavanaugh dissent in which he laments that a skilled visa programme was being used by a restaurant to bring in foreign labourers.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'It's been 50 days since I heard of my son'

""Mere economic expediency does not authorise an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers,"" he wrote.

In another dissent, Mr Kavanaugh wrote in 2008 that a union election should have been voided because undocumented workers had participated.

Several other names on Mr Trump's Supreme Court short-list had been derided by grass-roots conservatives as being ""pro-amnesty"" for undocumented migrants (Raymond Kethledge) or having done free legal work for undocumented migrants (Thomas Hardiman).

On the Docket: It is probably only a matter of time before more of Mr Trump's immigration actions come before the court - perhaps including one of the legal challenges to his border enforcement policies that have resulted in the separation of undocumented immigrant families.

Up until two weeks ago, when the Supreme Court by a one-vote majority upheld Mr Trump's travel ban, the judiciary had been a frustrating roadblock to the president's effort to enact his immigration policies. Mr Kavanaugh, at least in the minds of the immigration hard-liners, will keep the end of the legal road clear.

Bureaucratic power

It's not as sexy as the other topics on this list, but one of the areas where Mr Kavanaugh may make the biggest impact is his firm views on the need to curtail the power of the federal bureaucracy.

It all goes back to a 1984 decision, Chevron v Natural Resources Defense Council, in which a unanimous court held that when congressional intent in crafting a law is unclear, the executive agency in charge of administering that law should be given wide latitude.

The Chevron precedent has effectively given presidents - and the executive branch - significant power to interpret laws as they see fit, often to the dismay of small-government conservatives.

Mr Kavanaugh has written that the Chevron decision has ""no basis"" in law and was an ""atextual invention"" by the Supreme Court that encourages presidential administrations to be ""extremely aggressive in seeking to squeeze its policy goals into ill-fitting statutory authorisations"".

On the Docket: The new nominee wouldn't be alone on the court in taking aim at Chevron - it's been a prime target of criticism by Neil Gorsuch, as well. Citations of and requests for ""Chevron deference"" come up like clockwork every term, so it wouldn't be long before Mr Kavanaugh has a chance to take a hatchet to a key support structure for the administrative state.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44746369,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Republican', 'Democratic']","['1', '1', '1', '1', '1']"
3ICOHX7ENDTGP1D1WLPHLRFKS3D0E6,Donald Trump Says You Need A Picture ID To Buy Groceries In America,"President Donald Trump told a crowd in Florida on Tuesday night that buying groceries requires an identification card.

Trump made the comment while pushing for voter ID laws at a rally in Tampa to support Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) in the state's gubernatorial race. The president touched on a number of his regular talking points, including unemployment rates and tariffs, before talking about voter fraud.

Trump claimed Democrats were attempting to give undocumented immigrants the right to vote.

""Which is why the time has come for voter ID, like everything else,"" Trump told the crowd. ""You know, if you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card. You need ID.""

There is no evidence that noncitizen voting is a widespread problem, despite Trump's claims. Pressed in court earlier this year to offer evidence of widespread noncitizen voting in Kansas, experts whose work Trump has relied on were only able to point to a handful of cases.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked to clarify Trump's remark at a press briefing on Wednesday. She attempted to deflect the comment by focusing on beer and wine purchases that require identification, even though Trump doesn't drink alcohol.

""He is not saying every time he went in, he is saying when you go to the grocery store,"" Huckabee Sanders said. ""I'm pretty sure everybody in here who has been to a grocery store that has purchased beer or wine has probably had to show their I.D. If they didn't, that's probably a problem with the grocery store.""

To be clear, American citizens do not need a picture ID to buy basic groceries. There are some federal and state regulations that prohibit the sale of alcohol or certain over-the-counter medications without identification, but that does not extend to basic food or cleaning products.

Social media users remarked on Trump's assertion as ""out of touch"" and wondered when the billionaire last bought his own groceries.

Trump discussed trade deals and immigration before the Tampa crowd using much of his typical rhetoric.

He once again used the term ""globalist,"" which is often used in xenophobic and anti-Semitic contexts, to refer to lobbyists fighting against his tariffs. Trump also went after Democrats for their views on immigration, including calls to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Trump ended the rally by boasting about the ""impact"" of his endorsements. He remarked on Brian Kemp's primary win in Georgia last week in a contentious Republican runoff for governor after he endorsed Kemp.

This story has been updated with information on noncitizen voting and a response from Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

39KV3A5D19PVHVI3IFUVPNTM18S7SE,Sen. Tom Carper projected to defeat left-wing challenger in Delaware Democratic primary,"Three-term incumbent U.S. Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware was projected to easily turn aside a Democratic primary challenge from insurgent candidate Kerri Harris Thursday.

With all precincts reporting, Carper had 65 percent of the vote, compared to 35 percent for Harris.

Carper likely will be a heavy favorite to win a fourth term in November against Republican nominee Rob Arlett, a Sussex County councilman who was state campaign chairman for Donald Trump in 2016. Arlett easily defeated former PayPal executive Gene Truono in the GOP primary.

Carper, a former state treasurer, congressman, and governor, has not lost a single election since the start of his political career in 1976. He was re-elected to a third term by 37 percentage points in 2012.

The 38-year-old Harris, an openly gay Air Force veteran, had hoped to follow in the footsteps of other activist Democrats who have pulled off shocking upsets in this primary season. Facing a huge fundraising disadvantage, she sought to paint Carper, 71, as an out-of-touch career politician.

""He has definitely become a corporatist,"" she said of Carper in an Associated Press interview. ""His entire career, if you look at it, has been centered around making sure corporations thrive, and almost a Republican idea of there will be a trickle-down effect. We know that trickle down doesn't work.""

Harris had called for a $15 hourly minimum wage, abolition of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), the elimination of student debt and a government-run health care system called Medicare-for-all. She was endorsed by Justice Democrats, a political action committee started by organizers of Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign.

However, Carper had the support of Delaware's Democratic establishment, including former Vice President Joe Biden. He was also backed by the AFL-CIO, the state teachers' union and Delaware's largest daily newspaper.

""It's not like I've never been primaried before,"" Carper said before Thursday's vote. He also touted his ability to work with members of both parties, saying that insurgent candidates like Harris and New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ""have little tolerance for centrists.""

In the Republican primary, Arlett ran on his support for Trump's agenda and his socially conservative positions, including opposition to abortion and gay marriage. He reminded GOP voters that Truono is openly gay and in a same-sex marriage.

""I'm married to a woman and he is not,"" Arlett replied when asked by a newspaper reporter just days before the election to describe the biggest contrast between him and Truono.

Arlett also tried to paint Truono, who changed his political registration from unaffiliated to Republican a year ago before announcing his Senate bid, as a ""party crasher.""

Arlett has said he would work in Washington to remove burdensome regulations on businesses, improve border security and fight for free and fair trade.

He also has called for repeal of ObamaCare and the defunding of so-called ""sanctuary cities.""

On the roster: Fox News Power Rankings: Candidates still count - Another key Trumpworld figure cuts deal with feds - Fox News Poll: Voters split on confirming Kavanaugh - Florida primary leaving some deep wounds - Putting the head in headshot

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: CANDIDATES STILL COUNT

With just seven primaries left in 2018 we look forward to soon being able to retire â€“ for the time being, at least â€“ from our work of reminding you that candidates count.

It is only too easy to look at elections as marshalled armies of data points arrayed against each other on the ballot box battlefield. Thirty-seven percent of whosits voting at a greater intensity than 41 percent of whatsits, etc.

This version lets both voters and politicians off too easily and unreasonably reduces the importance of quality candidates. The numbers of whosits and the intensity of the whatsits really does depend on who is running. This weekâ€™s changes to the Fox News Power Rankings tell that tale quite clearly.

Weâ€™re looking at the Senate this week, so first some context is in order. You can click here to see how things stand, but the short version goes like this: Democrats would need to gain two seats to take control of the Senate. There are 36 seats up for grabs this year, but for now only 11 appear to be competitive in any real sense. Of those, Democrats currently control seven and Republicans control four.

For Democrats to take the Senate they need to win nine of the 11 most hotly contested races. So you can see why even in a tough year for the GOP, Republicans remain bullish on their chances to actually expand their narrow majority.

Doing so would be a lot easier, however, if the Red Team can find a way to not give back any seats.

Republicans could take a good step in that direction on Tuesday in Arizona. Republican Sen. Jeff Flake is retiring and his departure touched off what at the outset looked to be one of the worst primary battles of 2018.

Rep. Martha McSally has the backing of the GOP establishment and has shown prodigious fundraising abilities and solid political skills in a state where maverick-y voters tend to defy conventional political definitions. Unfortunately for her, McSally drew former state lawmaker Kelli Ward as her principal primary foe.

Ward gained national attention in 2016 when she tried to unseat Sen. John McCain. She fell short after a nasty race, but demonstrated her powerful connection to the large contingent of Arizona populist nationalists of the Trump variety.

But McSally has caught a couple of breaks. First was the candidacy of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, recipient of a preemptive pardon from President Trump and a hero to immigration hardliners. Arpaioâ€™s entry meant Ward had to cover her own right flank rather than focusing on McSally. McSallyâ€™s other good fortune was that the Trump movement and the president himself opted to stay out of the race all together.

The vote may be Tuesday, but we could have probably declared the race as good as over last week when Ward, who has trailed in every public poll taken since April, invited a notorious figure from the 2016 election â€“ one of the principal abettors of a conspiracy theory which held that Democrats were raping children in the basement of a Washington pizza restaurant â€“ on her bus tour.

Ugh.

For some time it appeared that McSally might go too far in kowtowing to the populist nationalists, but she has mostly kept it together, and looks poised to cruise on Tuesday. Thatâ€™s bad news for Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema who has, until now, had an open lane to reinvent herself as a moderate in what is still a Republican-leaning state.

As McSallyâ€™s first general election ad shows, the free ride is over.

Because of McSallyâ€™s surprisingly clear flight path to victory, we are changing the race rating from â€œLean Democratâ€ to â€œToss Up.â€ Let the desert duel begin.

Meanwhile in Montana, we have the battle of the flat tops.

Democratic Sen. Jon Tester was a marked man after he helped scuttle Trumpâ€™s nomination of his doctor, White House physician Ronny Jackson, to lead the troubled Veterans Administration. While the president vowed to knock Tester out in retribution, Republicans still needed a vehicle for their revenge.

In June, the state GOP chose state Auditor Matt Rosendale as their man. Heâ€™s been in politics in his adopted home state since 2010, using the fortune he made in real estate back East to, with varying degrees of success, push his way into state politics.

But despite a presidential campaign visit and two months to take the fight to Tester, Rosendale appears to still be lagging. They may have the same haircut, but so far Tester seems to have succeeded in setting himself apart.

For that reason, we move the race one notch to the left from, â€œToss Upâ€ to â€œLean Democrat.â€



THE RULEBOOK: ROOM TO GROW

â€œWhen the dimensions of a State attain to a certain magnitude, it requires the same energy of government and the same forms of administration which are requisite in one of much greater extent.â€ â€“ Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 13

TIME OUT: â€˜IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE IT, YOU GET TOUGHERâ€™

Naval aviator John McCain was held as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam from Oct. 26, 1967 until March 14, 1973 â€“ 1,966 days. He endured brutal beatings and abuse for much of that time because he declined to accept the pardon offered to him as the son of the admiral in command of the U.S. Pacific fleet. McCain refused to jump ahead of enlisted men and those who had been imprisoned before him. But his refusal denied the communists a public relations victory, and they spent their fury on the young pilot.

After returning home in 1973, McCain wrote a first-person account of his ordeal for U.S. News &amp; World Report. We encourage you to read it all here. But in light of the announcement from McCainâ€™s family that the 81-year-old senator from Arizona has discontinued medical treatment for the aggressive form of brain cancer with which he was stricken last year, we suggest some special consideration of the following passage:

â€œI was finding that prayer helped. It wasnâ€™t a question of asking for superhuman strength or for God to strike the North Vietnamese dead. It was asking for moral and physical courage, for guidance and wisdom to do the right thing. I asked for comfort when I was in pain, and sometimes I received relief. I was sustained in many times of trial. When the pressure was on, you seemed to go one way or the other. Either it was easier for them to break you the next time, or it was harder. In other words, if you are going to make it, you get tougher as time goes by.â€

So should every believer pray: courage, guidance and wisdom so that we too might get tougher as time goes by.

Amen.

ANOTHER KEY TRUMPWORLD FIGURE CUTS DEAL WITH FEDS

WSJ: â€œAllen Weisselberg, President Trumpâ€™s longtime financial gatekeeper, was granted immunity by federal prosecutors for providing information about Michael Cohen in the criminal investigation into hush-money payments for two women during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Weisselberg was called to testify before a federal grand jury in the investigation earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal previously reported, citing people familiar with the investigation. The decision by prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorneyâ€™s office to grant immunity to Mr. Weisselberg escalates the pressure on Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Weisselberg has served for decades as executive vice president and chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. After Mr. Trump was elected, he handed control of his financial assets and business interests to his two adult sons and Mr. Weisselberg.â€



National Enquirer killed safeâ€™s worth of damaging Trump stories - AP: â€œThe National Enquirer kept a safe containing documents on hush-money payments and other damaging stories it killed as part of its cozy relationship with Donald Trump leading up to 2016 presidential election, people familiar with the arrangement told The Associated Press. The detail comes as several media outlets reported Thursday that federal prosecutors have granted immunity to National Enquirer chief David Pecker, potentially laying bare his efforts to protect his longtime friend Trump. â€¦ Several people familiar with the Enquirerâ€™s parent, American Media Inc., who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they signed non-disclosure agreements, said the safe was a great source of power for Pecker, the companyâ€™s CEO.â€



Continetti: â€˜From Reality TV to Reality Politicsâ€™ - Free Beacon: â€œTrump went from star of reality TV to sole practitioner of reality politics. He turned Republican, national, then world politics into a riveting spectacle, a new sort of contest in which the stakes are nothing less than the fate of the United States and the protagonist must face down a staggering number of opponents to win the prize. And Trump had an advantage. He alone was familiar with the contents of the reality politics rulebook. Which meant that his antagonists, from Bob Corker to Robert Mueller, from Chuck Schumer to Elizabeth Warren, from the media to the NFL, from Ayatollah Khamenei to Xi Jinping, were on defense. â€¦ I had assumed that Trump's unusual background would limit his influence over candidate behavior. As Cohen, Omarosa, and Avenatti show, one has to be removed from statehouses and governor's mansions to practice reality politics. Recent events give me second thoughts. The emergence of these anti-Trumps suggests that there is a future for outsiders versed in tabloids, wrestling, and â€˜structured reality.â€™â€



FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS SPLIT ON CONFIRMING KAVANAUGH

Fox News: â€œVoters are increasingly divided over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court since President Trump announced him as his choice to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. Forty-five percent would confirm Kavanaugh, while 46 percent oppose him, according to the latest Fox News poll. Last month, voters supported him by a 38-32 percent margin. Many voters at that time, 30 percent, had no opinion on Kavanaughâ€™s nomination. That makes sense, given interviews for the July poll were conducted July 10-11, which was soon after the presidentâ€™s July 9 prime-time announcement of his selection. Since July, support for Kavanaugh is up 15 points among Republicans (was 70, now 85 percent), while opposition among Democrats is up 20 points (was 58, now 78 percent). Thereâ€™s a gender gap too, as men (53 percent) are 15 points more likely than women (38 percent) to support his confirmation. Many other nominees received similar mixed support. For example, voters backed the confirmation of President Trumpâ€™s first nominee Neil Gorsuch by a 45-39 percent margin (March 2017), and former President Obamaâ€™s second nominee Elena Kagan by 38-36 percent (June 2010).â€



Kavanaugh takes a step back from presidential immunity - The Hill: â€œSenate Democrats on Thursday pressed Judge Brett Kavanaugh on how he would view potential obstruction of justice or other possible criminal charges against President Trump if he were confirmed to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh appeared to walk back some of his earlier claims that the president should be shielded from investigations while in office, Democratic lawmakers who spoke with the Supreme Court nominee told The Hill. Trump has faced heightened legal scrutiny this week after his former longtime lawyer Michael Cohen told a judge that Trump directed him to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in hush money involving two women, in violation of campaign finance law. Senate Democrats say that Kavanaugh's handling of any case against Trump that could potentially come before the Supreme Court will take center stage when the nominee's confirmation hearings begin after Labor Day.â€



Kavanaugh not involved in report on Ken Starr office leaks - WaPo: â€œAn investigation into alleged leaks to the press from the office of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr in the 1990s makes no reference to any role played by his one-time associate, Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh. The 1999 report, made public Thursday by the National Archives, cleared Starrâ€™s office of allegations that it improperly leaked grand jury testimony. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee had urged its release in an effort to determine whether Kavanaugh was involved in such leaks. Kavanaugh played a lead role in Starrâ€™s investigation into the death of Clinton White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster and President Bill Clintonâ€™s relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky. He was a go-to source for journalists and authors.â€



FLORIDA PRIMARY LEAVING SOME DEEP WOUNDS

Orlando Sentinel: â€œWith Florida voters finally about to decide party nominees on Tuesday, both Republicans and Democrats could find themselves damaged by the fighting and attacks that have marked the race for governor. â€¦ On the GOP side, Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis havenâ€™t let up on each other after weeks of bickering. Most polls suggest DeSantis, an outsider running largely on his endorsement by President Donald Trump, is leading over Putnam, a close ally of many state Republicans. â€¦ At the same time, attacks on former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham by fellow Democrats â€“ especially Palm Beach billionaire Jeff Greene â€“ could damage her going forward, especially if progressives backing Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum or Winter Park businessman Chris King find themselves on the losing side again when Bernie Sanders lost to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic race for president.â€



It's official: Balderson wins Ohio special election - Cincinnati Enquirer: â€œAfter all votes were counted, Republican Troy Balderson won a surprisingly tight race to replace former U.S. Rep. Pat Tiberi in a closely watched central Ohio district. Balderson, with endorsements from President Donald Trump and Gov. John Kasich, eked out a win over Democrat Danny O'Connor to fill the remaining months of Tiberi's term. â€˜I'm humbled by the support I've received from voters and look forward to representing Ohio's 12th Congressional district in Congress,â€™ Balderson said in a statement Friday. He added that O'Connor ran a â€˜hard-fought race.â€™ In an unusual turn of events, Balderson and O'Connor will face off again on Nov. 6, fighting this time for a two-year term in Congress. Balderson's slim victory allows Republicans to maintain control of a seat that hasn't been ceded to Democrats in decades. Tiberi and Kasich both served the district for years. The race never should have been that close.â€



Dem Danny O'Connor flips stance on Pelosi speakership - Free Beacon: â€œDanny O'Connor, a Democratic congressional candidate in Ohio, said Friday he would not support House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) for speaker after previously saying that if she's the one the â€˜Democratic Party puts forward,â€™ he would. O'Connor appeared on MSNBC's â€˜Morning Joeâ€™ to discuss his candidacy and answer questions about Pelosi, and he said Washington, D.C. needs â€˜new leadership.â€™ MSNBC guest John Heilemann [said] â€¦ â€˜My question for you is, what do you think of where the speaker currently is and whether you can envision a world in which Nancy Pelosi is not the speaker of â€” the potential speaker of the House and the head of your party?â€™ Heilemann asked. After dodging the question, MSNBC guest Susan Del Percio â€¦ repeated Heilemann's question about whether he will support Pelosi for speaker if Democrats take control of the House. â€˜No, I would not,â€™ O'Connor said. â€¦ O'Connor's response contradicts what he said on MSNBC's â€˜Hardball With Chris Matthewsâ€™ on July 24.â€



Pence, Scalise raise big bucks in New Orleans - The [Louisiana] Advocate: â€œVice President Mike Pence and U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise rallied 140 Republican donors Thursday night in New Orleans by repeatedly warning about the specter of a Congress led by Nancy Pelosi, the former Democratic speaker of the House. â€¦ The fundraiser at the National World War II Museum took place at a time when many analysts believe that Democrats can win enough seatsâ€¦ Pence and Scalise told the well-heeled crowd that would be bad for America. â€¦ Pence and Scalise credited the tax cuts and other moves by the Trump administration with generating the countryâ€™s current strong economic growth, including what they said are record low unemployment rates among African-Americans and Hispanics.â€



Trump sticks with establishment in Mississippi - WaPo: â€œPresident Trump declared his support Thursday for Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), wading into a closely watched race that has divided Republicans. In a pair of late-afternoon tweets, Trump wrote that Hyde-Smith has helped him â€˜put America First!â€™ and has his â€˜complete and total Endorsement.â€™ Hyde-Smith was appointed earlier this year to succeed Republican Thad Cochran, a longtime senator who stepped down amid health problems. She is running in a special election that will be held on Nov. 6, the same day as the regularly scheduled midterms. â€¦ Also in the Mississippi race is Chris McDaniel, an insurgent conservative who has been hostile to Senate GOP leaders and nearly defeated Cochran in 2014. McDaniel was encouraged to run by Stephen K. Bannon, Trumpâ€™s former chief strategist.â€

Biden makes rare endorsement in testy Delaware primary - NBC News: â€œJoe Biden is endorsing longtime colleague Tom Carper as he faces his toughest primary battle in decades, a rare move by the former vice president to take sides in a primary in his home state. Biden has agreed to record a robocall on behalf of Carper, who is seeking his fourth term as Delaware senator and has served in statewide office continuously since 1977. It will begin reaching state voters next week ahead of the Sept. 6 primary, NBC News has learned. â€¦ At first glance Biden's endorsement of Carper is unsurprising, given the decades-long partnership between the two. But Biden has rarely â€” if ever â€” taken sides in Democratic primaries in his state since being elected to the Senate in 1972.â€

FROM THE BLEACHERS

â€œYou made the comment (based, I know on polls) that something better than 80 percent of GOP voters stand solidly behind the president. I am not sure what that â€˜solidlyâ€™ actually means, but put me in the 20 percent. I feel for every Republican candidate running this year, for I know that at least a few of them must be appalled at, for instance, the remarks about Jeff Sessions, yet have to be afraid ever to hint of any disagreement with the president. Just glad I voted Libertarian so that I could stick to my principles. Cowardly? Maybe, but a bad choice means there was not a good choice. When Trump has done well it has been in areas where any Republican would have done the same.â€ â€“ John Johnson, Tucson, Ariz.



[Ed. note: One of the most important questions in life, but particularly in politics is always â€œor what?â€ And to a certain degree partisan approval or disapproval ratings for sitting presidents are questions relating to votersâ€™ satisfaction with their decisions in the previous election. Many in that 80 percent may not be saying that they are pleased with Trump, per se, but that they are glad that Hillary Clinton is not president. But that will go for 2020 as well, when Clinton is not on the ballot. Thereâ€™s a great deal of attention paid to these job approval numbers. We do it, as do most of our peers, and they are useful. But in American politics what really matters are choices in binary votes. Of course, many, like yourself opted not to choose the lesser of two evils and excuse yourself from the bloody fray. So far, the Democrats have been the best thing Trump has had going for him. Weâ€™ll see if that continues to be the case after 2018 and into Trumpâ€™s re-election.]



â€œâ€˜Who knows what might transpire if members of Congress voted by secret ballot?â€™ Going out on a limb, I hazard to guess a whole lot of mischief would transpire. We have enough trouble with voice votes. But seriouslyâ€”as comedians and political pundits are wont to sayâ€”why shouldn't all campaign donations be made anonymously so the politicians are not aware of their specific financiers? Making every constituent a possible, anonymous donor is a much better campaign finance reform than anything Russ Feingold and John McCain ever proposed.â€ â€“ Michael Friend, Atlanta

[Ed. note: You are certainly right, Mr. Friend, but there are a few considerations to bear in mind. Are we to suppose that the individualâ€™s collection of donations on behalf of campaigns would not find ways to signal to office holders the identities of their most generous friends? When a politician showed up at a party and saw people wearing say white boutonnieres or red armbands, he or she might know who gave what. Or, more simply, fundraisers could just tell candidates that Frank N. Stine or I. P. Freely were very, VERY enthusiastic supporters *wink* and did you know that Messrs. Stine and Freely happen to have applied for a fat government grant for their firm? Also to consider: Voters ought to know where campaignsâ€™ support is coming from. It might be material to you to know that one faction, special interest or pressure group had fallen in with big cash for a particular candidate. There are no easy answers when it comes to campaign finance reform. Virginiaâ€™s system is pretty good. It doesnâ€™t limit contributions but it does require instantaneous reporting, which is posted immediately online. As a rule, I tend to think that complexity is the enemy of accountability and understanding.]

PUTTING THE HEAD IN HEADSHOT

UPI: â€œA Missouri teen's school photos are going viral after the green shirt he wore on picture day blended in with the photographer's green screen. Laurel Hutsell said in a Facebook post that her son, Carter, wore a green shirt for his seventh grade picture day, and he came home concerned that the photographer was using green screen effects. Hutsell said she thought â€˜maybe they will be OK,â€™ but when the sample proofs came back Carter appeared as a floating head due to the green screen backgrounds projecting onto his shirt. â€˜At least his hair and smile were on point!â€™ Hutsell wrote. Inter State Studio, the studio behind the now-viral photos, said the proofs don't go through a human proofing process to allow for a quick turnaround time. The studio said â€˜floating headâ€™ incidents like Carter's occasionally happen, but the photos can be fixed for the final product.â€

A white male candidate.,"The newest star of the Democratic Party, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, launched her New York congressional campaign by declaring â€œwomen like me arenâ€™t supposed to run for officeâ€ â€” a jarring embrace of her distinction as a 28-year-old Latina less than a year removed from a job tending bar.

Her campaign slogan: â€œItâ€™s time for one of us.â€

That appeal to the tribal identities of class, age, gender and ethnicity turned out to be a good gamble, steering her to the nomination in a year when Democratic voters are increasingly embracing diversity as a way to realize the change they seek in the country.

Given an option, Democratic voters have been picking women, racial minorities, and gay men and lesbians in races around the country at historic rates, often at the expense of the white male candidates who in past years

typified the partyâ€™s offerings. Â­Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s opponent, veteran Rep. Joseph Crowley, a

white man representing a Â­majority-minority district, fit that bill.

The divide is more stark than any other so far in the primary season, and it reflects the partyâ€™s growing dependence on female and minority voters.

The ideological splits between liberal and far-left candidates were predicted to be the focus of clashes this year, but voters have sent conflicting signals on that front.

The tribal trend has implications for the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, where a historic number of nonwhite and female candidates are considering launching campaigns, including Sens. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Cory Booker (N.J.). They will likely face off against a cadre of more traditional white male candidates, including possible bids by former vice president Joe Biden and former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe.

â€œThe ideological part is only a very small piece. There is something deeper going on,â€ said Simon Rosenberg, a strategist at the New Democratic Network. â€œIn this new social media age of politics, compelling, authentic candidates who can tell positive stories about themselves are succeeding over lifer politicians.â€

At a rally in Nevada over the weekend, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), another potential 2020 Democratic contender who never fails to mention her own hardscrabble childhood in Oklahoma, got cheers when she let slip that she wanted to see a woman occupy â€œthat really nice, oval-shaped room at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.â€

Many of the key Democratic House primaries this year have been competitions over biography, with a premium given to those who break new ground or remove old barriers. House nominees in key races to unseat Republicans include a black former NFL player turned attorney, a female retired fighter pilot and a lesbian Air Force intelligence officer, all of whom defeated more conventional opponents.

â€œYou donâ€™t want to run against a Democratic woman this year,â€ Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said Wednesday about the trend, citing the House primary in Kentucky won by that former fighter pilot. â€œAmy McGrath defeated a two-term mayor with a 70 percent approval rating. She did that because she was a fresh face who tapped into the new energy out there.â€

This proved the case again in New York on Tuesday, when Â­Ocasio-Cortez toppled Crowley, one of the most powerful Democrats in the nation and one widely seen as heir apparent to Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

On the same night, upstate in the Catskill Mountains, Antonio Delgado, an Oxford- and Harvard-educated African American lawyer, emerged from a crowded field of six white Democratic candidates, some of them more liberal, for the chance to take on Rep. John Faso (R-N.Y.) in one of the most competitive House elections this cycle.

In Maryland, Democrats nominated Ben Jealous, the African American former head of the NAACP, making him the second black gubernatorial nomination this year, following former Georgia statehouse leader Stacey Abramsâ€™s win last month. There have been only two African Americans elected governor in the 50 states in recent history â€” and at least two more black Democratic candidates, in Florida and Wisconsin, have a chance to win nominations this fall.

Through the end of June, 151 women have won House Democratic primaries, nearly doubling the 81 female nominees at the same point in the 2016 cycle, according to data collected by the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University. Republican nominations of women rose much more slowly, to 32 in 2018 from 27 in 2016.

â€œHistorically, what we have seen, which could also be true in this cycle, is the association of women with something different, something new and something that represents change,â€ said Kelly Dittmar, a professor at the center. â€œIn this year, women provide one of the starkest contrasts to the president and the party in power in Washington.â€

For some Democrats, there is a clear logic to trying to elevate politicians who belong to underrepresented groups, given the threat many feel from the behavior and policies of President Trump, who regularly magnifies racial division and has been caught on tape boasting about the sexual assault of women.

â€œItâ€™s not accidental that Donald Trump followed the first black president riding a wave of resentment,â€ said Steve Phillips, founder of Democracy in Color, a group that promotes youth and minority political activism. â€œAnd itâ€™s not accidental that the people who are fighting back are the people who are being attacked.â€

Polls show that Democrats generally place a far higher value on racial, ethnic and national diversity than Republicans. A Pew Research survey in late April found that 58 percent of Americans say increasing numbers of people from different groups makes America a better place. That included 70 percent of people who identified with the Democratic Party and 47 percent who identified with Republicans.

Ocasio-Cortez, who calls herself a Democratic socialist, ran on the left edge of her own party, endorsing many of the most liberal policies in circulation, including an abolition of the office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Medicare for all, and a program to guarantee government jobs at $15 an hour for all Americans. Crowley, who has his own liberal record and co-sponsored a Medicare-for-all bill, countered by calling ICE â€œfascistâ€ and saying he wanted reforms without abolishing the agency.

But policy was not the clear dividing line in the race.

Ocasio-Cortez spent much of the campaign, including much of the only one-on-one debate, focusing on Crowleyâ€™s decision to take money from corporate donors and raise his kids in Virginia while he worked at the U.S. Capitol. She argued throughout the campaign that Crowley â€œdoesnâ€™t drink our water or breathe our air.â€

Two years after Crowley was elected to the state legislature in the late â€™80s, Queens County, where he was born, was about 58 percent white, according to the 1990 Census. Today, it is 48 percent white, according to census figures. The district he represents, which includes parts of the Bronx, is 18 percent white.

â€œI think the district has changed very dramatically, and I think that she, from her ideas to her diversity, I mean she really reflects her district,â€ Booker said in an interview Wednesday.

The closest analog to Crowleyâ€™s downfall was Dave Bratâ€™s unexpected 2014 Virginia primary defeat of Rep. Eric Cantor, a Republican leader seen by many as a future House speaker. But that race, between two white men of similar age and background, hinged on the conservative dispute over immigration and a determination by voters to upset the ways of Washington.

Several of the outside groups working to recruit and train candidates for the Democratic ticket have placed a premium on finding women and minorities. Amanda Litman, co-founder of the candidate training and support organization Run for Something, said candidates who broke the white-male mold were doing better because voters want to support people like themselves.

â€œThe candidates that do the best are the ones who are most representative of their communities, and thatâ€™s women and people of color,â€ she said. â€œTheyâ€™re able to represent their voters in an authentic way, much more powerful than gender or any other single factor.â€

Maurice Mitchell, national director of the liberal Working Families Party, said electing more diverse candidates was â€œpart of my mandate.â€

Earlier this year, he became the first black man to lead the organization, which began as a left-wing political party and has grown into an organizing force for liberal candidates and set out to elect more nonwhite leftists.

â€œThis is where the energy is. This is where our most idealistic thinking and strategizing on the ground is,â€ he said. â€œWe want to break up the idea that the way you get folks elected is choosing middle-of-the-road white male business owners and veterans to run â€” people who will only say and do the most scripted things that polarize the least people.â€

Ocasio-Cortez, who has become one of the leading figures of the Democratic Partyâ€™s left wing after her shock win over Rep. Joe Crowley, D-NY, in a primary last month, is in Kansas City to help Democratic hopeful Brent Welderâ€™s challenge against Republican Kevin Yoder.



In a video with fellow left-wing darling Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., she then made what appeared to be a gaffe.



â€œHello, everybody! So excited to be here on Sen. Sandersâ€™ account and weâ€™re here in Kansas City to rally for Brent Welder,â€ Cortez said to the camera. â€œWeâ€™re gonna flip this seat red in November.â€

Democrats traditionally use blue as their color while Republicans use red. However, some commentators noted that red is the traditional color for socialism -- a label Ocasio-Cortez has not shied away from.



Ocasio-Cortez said earlier in the day that ideas â€œonce considered to be radicalâ€ are now part of the â€œmainstream conversation.â€ She has touted ideas such as single-payer healthcare and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

OCASIO-CORTEZ AND SANDERS, IN JOINT RALLY, SAY THEIR AGENDA IS NOW DEMOCRATIC 'MAINSTREAM'



Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s arrival onto the Democratic scene has split the party, exciting the base on one hand while also sparking criticism from the partyâ€™s center -- who fear that far-left ideas could end in electoral defeat in swing states.



Joe Lieberman, who was the Democratic Party's candidate for vice president in 2000, in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, said that Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s ideas will struggle to gain support across America.

""When I see somebody who really says she's a socialist -- she's a very captivating, charismatic candidate -- when you look at those policies, those policies will not be supported in many places across America,"" Lieberman said.

3D0LPO3EACHZYNMBY73MIV3I84XOY6,Mitch McConnell Confronted By Protesters Asking: 'Where Are The Babies?',"For the second time in as many weeks, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was challenged Saturday by protesters who confronted him over the Trump administrationâ€™s zero-tolerance border policy.

McConnell was leaving a Louisville restaurant after having lunch with Jonathan Shell, the outgoing majority leader of Kentuckyâ€™s House of Representatives, when he was approached by a group of demonstrators, reported the Courier-Journal.

As shown in a video recording below of the encounter, the protesters chanted â€œVote you outâ€ and â€œAbolish ICE,â€ referring to the controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

One man is heard asking McConnell: â€œWhere are the babies, Mitch?â€ â€” an apparent reference to the migrant children who have yet to be reunited with their families despite President Donald Trumpâ€™s executive order last month ordering an end to family separations among undocumented immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.

The senator did not appear to acknowledge the protesters.

Shell, defeated in May by a high school math teacher in the Republican primary for Kentuckyâ€™s House District 71, called the demonstrators â€œa small group of extremistsâ€ in comments to the Courier-Journal.

One man had shouted at McConnell, â€œWe know where you live, Mitch,â€ as the senator had walked away from the group and got into a vehicle. Shell chastised the protester for his remark, calling it a â€œnot-so-subtle threat right out of the Maxine Waters playbook,â€ referring to the House Democrat from California who has urged public confrontations with high-profile Trump administration officials and Republicans.

According to WLKY-TV, nearly 1,000 protesters had gathered in downtown Louisville on Saturday morning to call for the abolishment of ICE. A small group of counterprotesters also gathered in support of the agency.

McConnell was confronted by protesters in June as he and his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, were leaving an event at Georgetown University in Washington.

â€œWhy are you separating families?â€ one demonstrator asked McConnell, who did not engage with the protesters.

Chao defended McConnell, shouting at the group to â€œleave my husband alone.â€

â€œHeâ€™s separating families,â€ a protester told Chao.

â€œHe is not,â€ she replied.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-protesters-confrontation-kentucky_us_5b41e51fe4b07b827cc18033,"['Neutral', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic']","['5', '5', '5', '4', '5']"

An Australian state has instructed train stations to stop broadcasting Sky News Australia, amid a widening backlash over a recent TV interview.

On Sunday, Sky News Australia hosted Blair Cottrell - a far-right figure with court convictions - in its studio.

It drew much public anger. Many pointed out that he had once called for schools to display images of Adolf Hitler.

On Thursday, Victoria said that the channel would no longer be played at train stations in central Melbourne.

""Hatred and racism have no place on our screens or in our community,"" tweeted Transport Minister Jacinta Allen.

Cottrell used his interview to call on Australia to reduce immigration, protect itself from ""foreign ideologies"" and to ""reclaim our traditional identity"".

Sky News Australia has said it was ""wrong"" to interview Cottrell on The Adam Giles Show. It has since suspended the programme.

How the backlash unfolded

Last year, Cottrell was one of three men found guilty by a magistrate of inciting contempt of Muslims, after the men staged a mock beheading to protest against the building of a mosque.

He was previously convicted of other offences, including arson and burglary.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Blair Cottrell's appearance on Sky News Australia has prompted a backlash

Many critics of the interview pointed out this history. But much anger centred on comments he had made on social media, especially about Nazism and women.

""Blair Cottrell is a far right-wing fascist who's a self confessed Hitler fan. He's boasted about using 'violence and terror' to manipulate women,"" tweeted one critic, Laura Jayes, a Sky News Australia presenter.

The backlash intensified when Jayes posted a screenshot of a tweet by Cottrell, in which he talked about hypothetically raping her on air.

One commentator, Craig Emerson, said he would no longer appear on the network, while brands American Express, Specsavers and Huggies all pulled advertising.

Victoria accused of 'censorship'

Ms Allan described the interview as ""the final straw"" for the network, telling local radio 3AW: ""There have been a number of interviews that had started to go down a slippery slope.""

She cited one recent interview in which a senator was accused of making sexist slurs.

Although Ms Allan's announcement was welcomed by some observers, others suggested it may have gone too far.

""Banning Sky from broadcasting at Victorian rail stations is absurd. The daytime line upâ€¦ is professional and first rate,"" tweeted academic and journalist Peter van Onselen.

Other commentators said it was an act of ""censorship"".

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A man accused of fatally stabbing his ex-girlfriend in Minnesota before slashing his own throat re-entered the U.S. illegally after being deported in 2012, federal authorities said Wednesday.

Fraider Diaz-Carbajal, 35, was charged Monday with second-degree murder in the Aug. 12 death of Enedelia Perez Garcia, 27, who died in his apartment in the Minneapolis suburb of Shakopee. Authorities said she suffered multiple stab wounds all over her body.

Diaz-Carbajal was initially hospitalized in critical condition, then booked into jail Monday. Bail was set at $1.5 million.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Shawn Neudauer told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Diaz-Carbajal was deported to Mexico in December 2012 because he had entered the country illegally, then racked up a criminal record that included three drunken-driving convictions and one for domestic assault. The spokesman said Diaz-Carbajal sometime later entered the country illegally again, and that that's a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

ICE has placed an immigration detainer on him with the Scott County Jail, Neudauer said, meaning the agency has probable cause to believe Diaz-Carbajal is deportable. It gives ICE authority to take custody of him if he's released for any reason.

According to the criminal complaint, a woman who lived in the man's apartment told police she heard Garcia and Diaz-Carbajal arguing and Garcia yelling ""drop the knife."" She saw him pinning Garcia down and stabbing her, the complaint added. She then saw him slash his own throat and stab himself several times, it said. The witness told police Garcia and Diaz-Carbajal had dated for three years before they broke up about a month ago.

Authorities have not said what led to the argument.

Court records don't list an attorney who could comment on Diaz-Carbajal's behalf. But the records show bail was set Monday at $1.5 million with standard conditions and $5 million without conditions, and that he has requested an interpreter. He's due back in court Friday.

An online fundraising campaign on GoFundMe says Perez left behind a 7-year-old daughter and a 56-year-old mother, and that her family needed financial help to return her body to Mexico.

The charges preceded news Tuesday that a different Mexican man suspected of living in the U.S. illegally allegedly confessed to kidnapping and killing an Iowa student who had disappeared a month earlier. President Donald Trump seized on Cristhian Bahena Rivera's arrest in the death of Mollie Tibbetts to call the nation's immigration laws ""a disgrace"" that can be fixed only by electing more Republicans. However, Rivera's attorney disputed in court Wednesday that his client was in the U.S. illegally.

Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a priority, claiming widespread crime by people living in the U.S. illegally. But studies by social scientists and the libertarian Cato Institute say that's not accurate and that states with higher shares of people living in the country illegally have lower violent crime rates.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/feds-man-charged-minnesota-stabbing-us-illegally-141237760.html,"['Republican', 'Republican', 'Democratic', 'Republican', 'Republican']","['4', '4', '3', '1', '4']"
3CVDZS288II5YTK4G1WL167X7TSMFS,Arizona senator battling brain cancer. What's his legacy?,"CLOSE Sen. John McCain discusses his most enduring contribution to the Senate during an interview with The Arizona Republic on Aug. 3, 2017. Thomas Hawthorne/azcentral.com

PHOENIX â€“ One word is sure to surface again and again as Sen. John McCain's legacy is detailed and debated.

The ""maverick"" label defined the Arizona Republican's rise in national politics and his first presidential campaign in 2000.

The description reflected a backstory of heroism and duty during the Vietnam War and fit McCain's efforts to lead bipartisan reforms of the campaign-finance and immigration systems. His central focus on Capitol Hill was national security, a bipartisan concern.

And he eagerly sparred with presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump.

The maverick reputation suggested an independent streak that played well with some voters in his Senate and presidential runs. McCain himself would use it when it suited him politically.

But it wasn't always a comfortable fit for McCain or even accurate. The former Navy captain and Vietnam prisoner of war could be a partisan brawler and GOP team player, too, much to the exasperation of his admirers in the Democratic Party and the Washington media.

â€œI don't decide on the labels that I am given. I said I have always acted in what I think is in the best interests of the state and the country, and that's the way that I will always behave.â€ John McCain

McCain distanced himself from the maverick label when it became a liability during his bid for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination and in his 2010 and 2016 Senate re-election races. But he never let it go completely, just as critics on the left would use it against him when they felt he wasn't living up to their idea of bipartisanship.

""That was a label that was given to me a long time ago,"" McCain said in 2010. ""I don't decide on the labels that I am given. I said I have always acted in what I think is in the best interests of the state and the country, and that's the way that I will always behave.""



In a 2002 memoir, Worth the Fighting For, McCain wrote that he worried ""the (maverick) act might be getting a little tired for a man of my years.""



But 15 years later, at age 80, McCain settled the argument once and for all when, in the early hours of July 28, 2017, he gave a dramatic thumbs-down to GOP legislation to undo the Affordable Care Act, casting a decisive vote that stalled Republican efforts to gut Obamacare.



Three days before that vote, in a memorable July 25 Senate floor speech, delivered at the height of partisan rancor over whether to repeal or save Obama's Affordable Care Act, McCain made a passionate case for the Senate to return to regular order and the civility and camaraderie for which the upper chamber once was known.

""The most revered members of this institution accepted the necessity of compromise in order to make incremental progress on solving Americaâ€™s problems and to defend her from her adversaries,"" McCain said in the remarks, which came less than a week after the disclosure that he was battling a deadly form of brain cancer.

""That principled mindset and the service of our predecessors who possessed it come to mind when I hear the Senate referred to as the worldâ€™s greatest deliberative body,"" he said. ""Iâ€™m not sure we can claim that distinction with a straight face today.""

In an August 2017 interview with The Arizona Republic, McCain said he was comfortable with people remembering him as the Republican maverick, but he added this:

""I also hope that they recognize what I've done on a lot of issues, especially national defense.""

Legislative contributions

In the legislative arena, McCain's work on the influential Senate Armed Services Committee â€“ he became chairman in 2015 â€“ and on defense policy were among his most lasting contributions.

His namesake campaign-finance-reform bill, which sought to combat the pervasive influence of special-interest money in politics, became law in 2002. But the Supreme Court overturned key parts, including regulations on independent corporate and union spending on political advertising.

â–º July 26: In text to gov's lawyer, congressman expresses interest in McCain seat

â–º July 13: What's next after John McCain's year with brain cancer?

Critics argued the campaign-finance law backfired and actually worsened fundraising efforts because it weakened political parties and shifted power toless accountable and more extreme third-party organizations. The law also led to the 2010 decision in Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission that greatly increased the influence of corporations, unions and outside groups on elections.

One ramification, given Congress' failure to mandate disclosure, has been that certain politically active nonprofits can hide the source of their money.

â€œI considered him a maverick. ... He would not always support the Republican position, though he also could be very partisan.â€ Dennis DeConcini, former Democratic senator from Arizona

And despite years of trying, none of McCain's attempts to overhaul the immigration system became law.

Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., agreed that national security is a big part of McCain's legacy.

""He has really helped shape our policy for a good amount of time, a quarter-century at least, in the Senate in terms of the post-World War II liberal international order with strong U.S. leadership and security arrangements and a focus on human rights.""

Former three-term Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who served six years with McCain in the Senate from 1987 until DeConcini's 1995 retirement, said he and McCain often had ideological differences and disagreed about the use of earmarks to pay for projects for Arizona. But DeConcini said he always respected McCain's military service in the Navy.

More recently, DeConcini said he admired the way that McCain was willing to stand up to Trump, his own party's president.

McCain and Trump battled publicly almost from the time Trump launched his presidential campaign in summer 2015. McCain eventually withdrew his endorsement of Trump in October 2016 after a vulgar recording surfaced of Trump talking about women.

""I considered him a maverick,"" DeConcini said of McCain. ""He went on his own trajectory on issues. He would not always support the Republican position, though he also could be very partisan, ... but that's understandable.

""I give him great credit for taking on Trump, not just because I am no fan of Trump's, but because that is really a courageous thing to do,"" DeConcini said.

'Maverick' candidate in 2000

McCain's presidential runs in 2000 and 2008 elevated him in the national consciousness.

During McCain's first bid for the Republican presidential nomination, Americans became acquainted with his personal story of being shot down over North Vietnam in 1967 and spending more than five years as a prisoner of war. McCain, the son and grandson of Navy admirals, refused early release because the military code of conduct demanded that POWs accept release only in the order in which they were captured.

McCain's scrappy, upstart 2000 presidential campaign and its reform platform were given little chance of victory but managed to throw the GOP establishment into a panic after his surprise upset of then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the New Hampshire primary.

Anti-McCain forces descended on South Carolina to halt his momentum ahead of that state's primary. In a brutal contest that has entered the lore of U.S. political history, his opponents waged an all-out effort that included, in some cases, outlandish and vicious smears of McCain and his family.

â€œHis run in 2000 was kind of the first inkling of the ability to run in an unorthodox way.â€ Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida

""I will not take the low road to the highest office in this land,"" McCain said after his South Carolina loss. ""I want the presidency in the best way, not the worst way.""

Though McCain carried on to Michigan and Arizona, his campaign was mortally wounded.

But even in defeat, he inspired some in his party.

""His run in 2000 was kind of the first inkling of the ability to run in an unorthodox way,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who would run for president in 2016. ""That was an unorthodox campaign against a favorite who ended up winning, but Sen. McCain, without any of the trappings of a traditional campaign front-runner, really gave future President Bush a run for his money.""

McCain and Bush remained at odds after Bush moved into the White House in 2001, with McCain famously opposing the GOP president's signature tax cuts in 2001 and 2003.

Establishment GOP pick in 2008

After his experience in 2000, McCain had reinvented himself as the GOP-establishment favorite by the time he launched his 2008 presidential campaign seven years later.

But financial troubles nearly upended his machine, and by summer 2007 McCain was running on a tight budget, preaching the need for victory in the unpopular Iraq War while stumping at town-hall-style events in Veterans of Foreign Wars meeting halls and similar venues all over Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.

â–º June 17: Meghan McCain calls John McCain 'greatest father in the world'

â–º June 5: Kelly Sadler, White House aide who reportedly mocked McCain, is out

""I'd rather lose a campaign than lose a war,"" McCain would say of the risk that his Iraq War stance posed to his political prospects.

In what was seen as a major comeback, McCain won the GOP nomination over rivals such as former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.

â€œIn the process of running in the 2008 election, there were multiple moments in that campaign where you saw him elevate above the moment and refuse to go in a direction that perhaps some wanted him to go. It was a testament to his character.â€ Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

Asthe party's nominee, McCain picked ""Country First"" as his slogan. But few political experts gave him much of a chance at defeating Democratic nominee Barack Obama â€“ a fresh and exciting figure in U.S. politics â€“ given the profound unpopularity of Bush and the war, and the financial crisis that threatened to wreck the economy.

In the end, McCain's attempt to revive the ""maverick"" brand didn't changes voters' perceptions. His campaign and foreign policy were painted as extensions of Bush's presidency, and it stuck.

Whether his pick of then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, chosen to help shore up the conservative base that distrusted him, hurt or helped remains a matter of debate. But some blame McCain's choice of Palin for the rise of right-wing populism that eventually led to Trump's election in 2016.

""One, Barack Obama was a very, very strong candidate, and that's the most important thing,"" McCain told The Republic in an interview in August 2017. ""Second, when the stock market collapsed, it really sent us into a real drop. Third of all, I guess Americans were ready for a change, too.

""But I'd like to emphasize the first thing I said: Barack Obama was an incredibly impressive candidate, and he did a great job campaigning,"" he said.

For some hard-right Republicans, McCain didn't hit Obama, the first African-American nominee of a major party, hard enough or often enough out of what they considered a fear of being tagged a racist.

â–º May 17: In new memoir, McCain talks Trump dossier, not tapping Joe Lieberman

McCain declined to make an issue of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama's former pastor in Chicago who had made a string of controversial political statements in his fiery sermons, including rejecting the slogan ""God Bless America"" for ""God Damn America.""

In another memorable moment, McCain corrected a woman at a town hall meeting who said she couldn't trust Obama because he was ""an Arab.""

""No, ma'am. He's a decent, family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues. And that's what this campaign is all about,"" McCain said.

McCain's honorable campaigning seems quaint when viewed through the lens of Trump's 2016 scorched-earth assault on his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Just eight years after McCain received the party's nomination, Republicans would chant ""Lock her up!"" at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.

But Rubio recalled McCain's exchange with the woman who said Obama was an Arab as ""an iconic moment"" in presidential campaign history.

""In the process of running in the 2008 election, there were multiple moments in that campaign where you saw him elevate above the moment and refuse to go in a direction that perhaps some wanted him to go,"" Rubio said. ""It was a testament to his character.""

Stature, seniority on Capitol Hill

McCain never settled his differences with the far-right wing of the Republican Party despite being the party's 2008 standard-bearer. At one point, Arizona party activists censured him as too liberal on issues such as immigration.

With his seniority and national profile, McCain's clout in the Senate grew. He got a reputation as a Senate heavyweight who could get things done.

In 2015, McCain, the classic Senate hawk on foreign policy, got his Capitol Hill dream job, taking the Armed Services Committee gavel.

As the panel's chairman, McCain was in his element, whether it was working to reform the Defense Department's weapons-acquisition process to curb waste, grilling Pentagon officials on policy or strategy or blasting disruptive anti-war demonstrators as ""lowlife scum"" as he ordered them out of the hearing room.

""This is a deeply passionate individual who has a sense of tackling injustice, whether it's the suffering in Syria or what (Russian President) Vladimir Putin has done,"" Rubio said. ""When he locks on, he's going to lock on. Very few things are going to move him off of it.""

The Cold War standoff between the United States and Soviet Union greatly influenced McCain's worldview. As a naval aviator, he was stationed on the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Enterprise off Cuba during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, and he was a relentless critic of Putin, whom he often called a murderer and a thug.

Putin officially sanctioned McCain in 2014. A few years later, a Kremlin spokesman said McCain was known for his ""maniacal hatred towards our country.""

McCain urged the United States to stand up to Putin's threat:

We need to be strong and steadfast.



Vladimir Putin is no fool. And he's going to figure out the profit and loss from actions that he can take.



We have to make it clear to him that the cost exceeds the benefit.



And that doesn't mean we're back in the Cold War. But it does mean that we take a realistic approach to Vladimir Putin and his ambitions.""

McCain's foreign-affairs outlook is set to live on through Arizona State University's McCain Institute for International Leadership, which the senator helped start in 2012 with unspent money from his 2008 presidential campaign.

Through studying and debating world issues, the institute aims to groom new generations of global leaders and scholars.

Spirit of bipartisanship

McCain's chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee was, like much of his work in the Senate, marked with a spirit of bipartisanship. He worked well with Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the committee's ranking Democrat.

The committee turned out annual defense authorization bills that would pass the Senate overwhelmingly.

""That's because all these years I've developed all these relationships with these guys and women, that we trust each other,"" McCain told The Republic.

Even before he became chairman, McCain was able to get many of his priorities included in the must-pass defense bill, including December 2014 language to allow a federal land swap needed for a massive copper mine near Superior, Arizona. The project is expected to provide jobs and an economic boost to the area.

""I think it has a lot to do with national security,"" McCain said at the time. ""This mine, when it's fully operational, will supply 25 percent of America's copper supply, and that is a national security issue.""

As the committee's chairman, McCain made overhauling defense acquisition one of his biggest priorities.

""In the last three National Defense Authorization Acts, Sen. McCain has championed sweeping measures to reform, streamline and improve the defense acquisition system,"" Julie Tarallo, McCain's spokeswoman, said in November. ""There is a long way to go to ensure America's weapons systems are delivered on time and at cost.""

Immigration reform failure

McCain's bipartisan efforts yielded mixed results on other issues.

Even though McCain never sat on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, his fellow Senate Republicans tapped him as the lead negotiator on a VA reform bill that he developed with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,the committee's then-chairman.

The compromise legislation rose from a nationwide scandal about wait times that unfolded at the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center in Phoenix.

The failure of comprehensive immigration reform to become law after years of trying was perhaps his biggest disappointment.

McCain worked on the issue for more than a decade. His belief in legislation that balanced border security with a foreign-worker program and a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants who have settled in the country hurt him politically with many anti-""amnesty"" voters in his own party.

""We ought to understand that Arizona is a state that is changing and, arguably, for the better.""

3VGET1QSZ1HOOCZC2K4WMCW77LO7WT,Judges Revive Catch-and-Release For Migrants With Children,"Administration officials are releasing thousands of migrants with young children into the United States, as required by judges, marking the return of catch-and-release policies for migrants with children.

Migrants with children are being released with ankle monitors so they can be tracked by border officials.

Officials admitted that the ankle-monitors do little to help enforcement officers find and repatriate the vast majority of the migrants who lose their asylum pleas, and that a large percentage of the first set of migrantsâ€™ children are not being reunified by their parents because of concerns about criminal activity. Also, some of those released parents reportedly prefer to leave their children with relatives in the United States to use schools and gain residency.

The initial wave of judge-ordered releases covers the migrants who brought 103 children younger than five. Of the 103, some 57 have been released and reunified with their children pending court hearings on the parentsâ€™ claims for asylum. However, 46 of the young children have not been returned to parents for a variety of reasons, including pending charges against their parents.

Officials will soon start reunifying roughly 2,000 parents with older children aged between 5 and 17, as required by judges.

Most of the migrants were separated from the children from April to June when President Donald Trump directed the end of catch-and-release for illegal migrants and asylum-seekers. This zero-tolerance policy required housing children in shelters while their parents were kept in detention until their legal claims were adjudicated. But a furious rage of protest about â€œfamily separationâ€ by progressives and media successfully pressured Trump to release parents of children pending their legal claims.

The reunification of the parents and children has highlighted several difficult issues, such as the useless of ankle bracelets.

â€œOn those individuals which we are required to release pursuant to the court order, generally, they will be placed on ankle bracelets to provide us a higher level of monitoring of their activities once they have been released,â€ said Matthew Albence, the Executive Associate Director of enforcement division at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. He spoke via phone at a July 10 press conference:

The use of the ankle bracelet is a tool which we use to hopefully encourage compliance from the individual that has been released to appear for their hearings â€¦ It has been effective with regard to ensuring appearance at hearing and meetings. It is not an effective removal tool. While we have a large number â€” over 80,000 â€” of individuals on [ankle bracelets] last year. That led to barely more than 2,400 removals, so it is not an effective removal tool, it is merely used to gain compliance with individuals going through the court process.

The ankle monitors are not a good substitute for detention, said Andrew Arthur, a former immigration-court judge who now works with the Center for Immigration Studies. He said:

If the [detained] alien is detained â€¦ the alien can be quickly removed [and be sent home]. If the alien is on an ankle monitor â€¦ he simply has to cut off the ankle monitor and disappear.

The revived catch-and-release policy is being enforced by judges, said Arthur. â€œGiven the Ms. L. [case] and the Flores settlement, Iâ€™m not sure how they would be able to detain family units for more than 20 days,â€ he said.

The judge-enforced revival of catch-and-release will invite more migration from Central American, Arthur wrote:

As U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) statistics reveal, the number of UACs and family units apprehended by the agency entering illegally plummeted after the inauguration of President Trump, falling from a high in FY 2017 of 22,934 (in November 2016) to a low of 2,115 (in April 2017). I wrote about this so-called â€œTrump effectâ€ in a May 2017 post. In a September 2017 follow-up, however, I noted that that effect appeared to be waning. That month, 7,152 UACs and family units were apprehended by the Border Patrol, according to CBPâ€¦ The administrationâ€™s efforts to stem the flow of aliens entering the United States illegally were beginning to have an effect by June 2018, when Border Patrol arrested 34,114 aliens along the border (a 15 percent decrease over the month before), including 5,115 UACs (an almost 20 percent decrease) and 9,449 family units (a slight decrease).

Agency officials can appeal the two legal decisions requiring catch-and-release, said Arthur. But that legal process would be slow because the Supreme Court will not return until October.

However, the inflow of migrants with children may be quickly reduced by new policy guidance from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Arthur said.

The new guidance makes clear that asylum law does not allow migrants who claim a â€œcredible fearâ€ of persecution by criminal gangs or violent spouses to file for asylum. It is â€œ very important because right now the grant rate for credible fear is 75 percent to 90 percent, and most of the people going through are claiming they will be harmed by criminal gangs or domestic abuse,â€ Arthur said.

â€œAssuming the guidance is faithfully adhered to, it would reduce the number of positive claims,â€ he added.

Migrants who enter the country illegally without children will be covered by Sessionsâ€™ zero-tolerance prosecution policy. That policy means single migrants are being processed en masse in courts and are quickly sent home.

But migrants can ask to apply for asylum even if they are caught sneaking across the border. That legal process takes longer than the 20-day limit set by judges for the shelter of children, allowing migrant who bring children to trigger catch-and-release.

Sessionsâ€™ credible-fear reform may reduce the inflow of parents with children to the point that nearly all can be kept in DHS-run family detention centers without catch-and-release.

The first parents released by the judges are the claimed parents of the 103 children under age 5. Of those, 57 have been released and given custody of their children.

The group includes a journalist from El Salvador, Jose Demar Fuentes, plus Olivia Caceres and their two young children, one-year-old Mateo and five-year-old Andree. Their story, according to KPBS station, is that:

Caceres entered the U.S. with Mateoâ€™s brother, Andree, now age 5, about a month after Fuentes and Mateo asked for asylum at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. The family had traveled across Mexico together, fleeing violence in El Salvador. They split up when Mateo began to show signs of dehydration. Caceres said the couple was in a rush to get their youngest son somewhere safe â€¦ Fuentes gave KPBS an interview from the detention center, and broke into tears multiple times when discussing his sons. Fuentes said he grew up without a father, and that there was nothing more important to him than being a present and involved parent.

The 46 under-5 children still in federal shelter include nine children whose parents are in federal or state custody facing various charges, and 12 children whose parents have been sent home. Officials have not said how many of those deported parents have declined to request the return of their children or have asked their children be assigned to relatives living in the United States.

Twenty-two of the 46 children could not be reunited â€œdue to safety concerns posed by the adults.â€ A July 12 statement said:

22 children have been found ineligible due to safety concerns posed by the adults in question:

11 adults have a serious criminal history (charges or convictions for child cruelty, kidnapping, murder, human smuggling, domestic violence, etc.);

7 adults were determined not to be a parent;

1 adult had a falsified birth certificate;

1 adult was alleged to have abused the child;

1 adult planned to house the child with an adult charged with sexually abusing a child; and

1 adult is being treated for a communicable disease.",https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/07/12/catch-and-release-returns-for-migrants-with-children/,"['Republican', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Republican', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Democratic']","['4', '5', '5', '4', '5']"

WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Donald Trump's repeated tongue lashings of NATO allies and his friendly overtures to Russian President Vladimir Putin are stirring questions at home and abroad about Trump's commitment to an Atlantic alliance that has been a pillar of U.S. security policy for more than half a century.

Might a reordering, or even a reduction, of U.S. forces in Europe be in the cards? Clues may come when Trump gathers Wednesday with NATO leaders in Brussels. The official agenda includes a plan for increasing the number of land, air and sea forces capable of reacting quickly in a European crisis, but overshadowing it are tensions generated by Trump's view that the Europeans are slackers leaning unfairly on the U.S. military.

At the risk of deepening the rift with traditional allies, Trump will then hold a summit in Finland with Putin. On his departure from Washington on Tuesday, the president remarked that he ""can't say right now"" if Putin is a friend or foe, but he predicted that his first summit with the Russian leader ""may be the easiest"" of all his meetings in Europe.

Such comments have stirred unease not just in Europe, but in Washington. A bipartisan resolution, set to be endorsed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, pointedly voices support for NATO as strategically important for the collective security of the trans-Atlantic region.

""Although the Atlantic alliance has weathered many crises over its lifetime, I now am concerned that the alliance will not survive Donald Trump,"" said Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, who served as senior director for European affairs on the National Security Council during President Barack Obama's first term.

""Because he isn't arguing with allies about policy. He's questioning the fundamental value of NATO to the United States. This antagonistic approach is generating an unprecedented debate in Europe and in Canada about whether the United States should be treated as friend or foe,"" she said.

The demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 prompted a partial drawdown of U.S. forces from Europe, but every administration since then has concluded that keeping a U.S. military presence there was important for wider U.S. security, political and economic interests, and as a sign of solidarity with Europe. NATO has been a key part of the long U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, for example, and it is expected to agree this week to take a bigger training role in Iraq.

Trump, who has also questioned the U.S. military presence in Asia, is challenging those assumptions. That has been most plain in his antagonistic approach to Germany, the main host of U.S. forces in Europe. He has criticized the Germans for not spending enough on their own defense and has castigated the country for what he calls an overly liberal immigration policy. He also has placed Germany at the center of his complaints about a U.S.-European trade imbalance.

Derek Chollet, executive vice president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank, says there is a clear connection between Trump's criticism of German defense spending and reports that the Pentagon has undertaken a review of the cost of keeping troops in Europe.

""You cannot read this any other way"" than looking at whether a U.S. troop reduction ""is a feasible option for punishing them for their apparent lack of will,"" said Chollet, who was the Pentagon's assistant secretary for international security affairs during Obama's second term.

He questions whether Trump fully understands the global significance of the U.S. military presence in Germany, including its hosting of the headquarters of U.S. Africa Command, which leads U.S. counterterrorism efforts in North Africa. Stuttgart also is headquarters for U.S. European Command. Among many other facilities, Germany hosts a U.S. military hospital at Landstuhl, the largest American hospital outside the United States.

In addition, NATO has proposed creating a new command in Germany to improve the way the alliance would move troops and equipment in a military crisis. Kay Bailey Hutchison, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, told reporters this plan will be approved at the Brussels summit.

Notwithstanding Trump's grumbles about America shouldering the defense burden of Europe, his administration plans to boost spending to support it.

In the aftermath of Russia's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014 and its subsequent military incursion into eastern Ukraine, the Pentagon ramped up joint exercises in eastern and central Europe and spent billions on what it calls the European Deterrence Initiative aimed at Russia. After spending $3.4 billion on that initiative last year, the Trump administration has proposed boosting it to $6.5 billion in the 2019 budget year.

Trump's Pentagon chief Jim Mattis is a former NATO commander and a leading advocate for sustaining the alliance, although he also has been pressuring allies to spend more on defense. Some of Mattis' predecessors were even stronger in their criticisms. Robert Gates, for example, said in Brussels in 2011 that European penny-pinching and distaste for front-line combat in Afghanistan was putting the future of the alliance at risk. Gates said NATO faced a ""dim if not dismal"" future, not least because of what he called a diminishing patience in Congress for spending on Europe's defense.

Trump, however, has taken this a step further by asserting that the Europeans are freeloaders taking advantage of American generosity.

In a new assessment of the NATO spending and burden-sharing issues, the Center for Strategic and International Studies called Trump's language ""uniquely divisive"" and said NATO members' contributions should be measured by more than simple budget numbers. The think tank was referring to the pledge at NATO's 2014 summit meeting that members would ""aim to move toward"" spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense by 2024. By its count, only four of NATO's 29 member countries met the 2 percent goal in 2017. They were the U.S., Greece, Britain and Estonia.

The report said a wider range of metrics should be used to measure an ally's contributions to collective defense. It cited as an example Denmark, which has not met the 2 percent goal in recent years but has made important contributions in other ways, including with troop deployments to Afghanistan and by sacrificing significant trade with Russia by complying with sanctions.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/trumps-attacks-nato-raise-questions-future-175551382--politics.html,"['Neutral', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Neutral']","['2', '1', '1', '1', '2']"

The mayor was quick to allude to Trump's mounting legal troubles one day after the president assailed Chicago's crime rate and immigration policies at a Tuesday night rally in West Virginia.

â€œFirst of all, we'll always be a welcoming city, because Chicago welcomed my grandfather, etc. But let me just say one thing, if I were Donald Trump, Iâ€™d spend my time figuring out which attorney Iâ€™m going to have,â€ Emanuel told Fox 32 Chicago.

One night earlier, Trump took jabs at Chicago's status as a high-crime city that also served as a sanctuary for immigrants.

""Take a look at Chicago. How about the mayor of Chicago? It's like a war zone. This is what those policies do,"" Trump said at the rally.

Chicago is known to have the some of the nation's most violent neighborhoods, with nearly 60 people shot and four people killed last weekend alone, Fox News reported.

But a researcher told Fox 32 that violence in the city's ""war zones"" is ""virtually all carried out by native-born Americans"" rather than immigrants.

Emanuel, meanwhile, was apparently preaching to the Democratic choir: A new survey showed that 70 percent of Cook County residents have an unfavorable view of Trump, the station reported.

Trump and Emanuel have a history of trading barbs.

In July, after Trump's Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Emanuel called for Trump's security clearance to be taken away, the Chicago Tribune reported.

â€œI donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ve ever thought this, but I did yesterday: Can you actually take away a presidentâ€™s security clearance, since they shouldnâ€™t be getting intel from the intel community?â€ Emanuel said, criticizing Trump's performance at the summit. â€œIâ€™ve never seen anything like this.â€

Amid Chicago's crime problems, Emanuel faces building pressure to take action or resign, the report said.

3PZDSVZ3J6Z1IV8F8LF2NHZ6N7U4NF,"Merkel, rebel minister agree migrant deal to avert govt crisis","Berlin (AFP) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel reached a deal Monday on migration with her rebellious interior minister, Horst Seehofer, defusing a bitter row that had threatened her government.

Both sides hammered out ""a truly good compromise ... after a tough struggle and difficult days,"" Merkel said, adding that it involved setting up holding and processing centres for asylum seekers near German borders.

""We have reached an agreement after very intense negotiations,"" Seehofer agreed, stressing that he intended to stay on in his cabinet post after earlier threatening to quit and gloating that ""it's worth fighting for your convictions"".

""We now have a clear agreement how to prevent illegal immigration across the Austrian-German border in future,"" said Seehofer, whose CSU is the traditional Bavaria state ally of Merkel's CDU party.

The deal still requires the consent of Merkel's other coalition partner, the centre-left Social Democrats, to become government policy.

It drew immediate fire from critics, such us Bernd Riexinger of the opposition far-left Die Linke party, who on Twitter slammed the plan for what he labelled ""mass internment camps"" and judged that ""humanity got lost along the way"".

Nonetheless, for now the deal suggested that Merkel -- in power for over 12 years, and the EU's longest serving leader -- goes on to live another day after surviving the latest bruising challenge to her authority.

- Immigration backlash -

Merkel has faced a strong backlash, and been weakened at the polls, over her 2015 decision to keep open German borders to a mass influx of migrants, many from war-torn Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, that led to more than one million arrivals.

Public anger and fear about the newcomers has given rise to the far-right, anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which entered parliament last year and threatens Seehofer's CSU in Bavarian state polls in October.

Seehofer, a long-time Merkel critic, had openly challenged her with a plan to order border police to unilaterally shutter German border crossings with Austria to many asylum seekers, effectively daring the chancellor to fire him.

The threat -- and Seehofer's subsequent warning he may resign -- had raised the spectre of an imminent break in the seven-decade-long partnership between their conservative CDU and CSU parties.

This would have deprived Merkel of her narrow parliamentary majority and forced her to either seek a new coalition partner or call a second election within a year, after scoring poor results in last September's vote.

That scenario scared all parties except the anti-immigration AfD which, polls suggest, could hope for further gains.

- Softening stance -

As Merkel won key concessions from EU partners on toughening migration rules, Seehofer and the CSU faced increasing pressure from other parties to avert a historic coalition breakdown.

The CSU softened its stance in the face of withering criticism across party lines and poor polling results, insisting that the alliance with the CDU must live on.

The flashpoint issue was Seehofer's demand to order German border police to immediately turn back all asylum seekers already registered elsewhere in the EU, and his threat to do so against Merkel's wishes.

Merkel rejected such unilateral German measures and pledged to reach bilateral deals instead with other EU states.

In Monday's deal, both sides agreed to set up closed ""transit centres"" -- similar to existing facilities at airports -- that would allow German authorities to speedily process applicants.

Those who are rejected could be sent back to their EU arrival country if that state agrees, says the joint CDU/CSU plan.

In cases where no such bilateral agreements exist, the asylum seekers would be sent back across the border ""on the basis of an agreement with Austria"" that was to be negotiated, it said.

While averting an immediate crisis, the plan also raised new questions -- especially when it comes to Italy, the main arrival country for migrants crossing the Mediterranean.

3FVBZG9CLKWS9B43MMXN6UCXKJ50HM,Why not wreck the planet? It could save your political skin,"Tom Chivers is a science writer who has worked at BuzzFeed and the Daily Telegraph newspaper. The opinions in this article belong to the author.

(CNN) There is a certain mindset in politics, present the world over and across the political spectrum, which distrusts expertise. That mindset is presently revealing itself in Australia, where this week a small group of conservative-minded members of parliament held the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hostage over climate policy .

Turnbull's center-right Liberal party had pledged to reduce emissions from Australia's energy companies more than a quarter (from 2005 levels) by 2030, a key part of its efforts to meet its international obligations.

But several of his own MPs, led by his predecessor as prime minister and long-term rival Tony Abbott, forced him into a climbdown by threatening to vote against the legislation. Turnbull's government barely has a majority in the House of Representatives, and losing such a key vote could have led to a leadership challenge. Cowed, he dropped the pledge, and on Tuesday narrowly survived the revolt.

Internal Liberal party politics are one thing. But the symbolism of the gesture is telling. Australia is a country where environmental damage is obvious, in the form of the hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic caused by use of CFCs decades ago, the steady bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef from warming, carbon-dioxide-acidified seas, and the ever more prevalent bushfires.

Yet for large parts of the political class here, and the people who vote for them, climate change is seen as a scam perpetrated by liberal, anti-business scientists.

One in five Australians, a poll last year showed, believe that climate change is a ""hoax."" Another poll in 2015 declared that Australia was the most climate-skeptical nation on Earth.

Abbott himself has said that the ""settled science"" of climate change is "" absolute crap "" and that efforts to reduce its impact are like ""killing goats to appease the volcano gods."" Another politician, the anti-immigration populist Malcolm Roberts, has clashed with scientist Brian Cox, claiming that NASA data was ""manipulated"" to make climate change appear worse than it was, to Cox's astonishment.

For the record, climate change is not a hoax. There is some debate over how extreme the warming will be, but the warming so far has been within predicted levels. NASA has not been falsifying data. This is conspiratorial, anti-scientific nonsense.

But anti-scientific nonsense is extremely appealing at the populist fringes of politics. In the US, President Donald Trump has also called climate change a hoax, perpetrated by the Chinese , and has been filling the Environmental Protection Agency with climate skeptics, including former chief Scott Pruitt, now resigned amid multiple ethics scandals

Trump is also anti-vaccine, associating with Andrew Wakefield, the disgraced, fraudulent British doctor behind the discredited research linking the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to autism, and weirdly claiming that multi-vaccine injections are bad because "" tiny children are not horses .""

British politics has its own share of climate skeptics and anti-vaccination conspiracy theorists, especially on the UKIP-led hard right. And the left is not innocent -- the left-wing populist leader of the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, once signed a parliamentary motion supporting the pseudoscientific alternative medicine homeopathy, tweeting that it ""works for some people ."" The Green Party is resolutely anti-nuclear and anti-genetically modified organisms.

What all these positions have in common is a distrust of what ""the experts"" are saying -- the relevant scientists who are almost uniformly convinced that climate change is real, human-made and dangerous; that vaccines are safe and highly effective; that homeopathy is ineffective, and that nuclear power and GMOs are important tools for powering and feeding the world.

Populism offers simple, intuitive alternatives to complex, messy reality. For example, immigrants or the EU are behind all your problems ; get rid of them and it'll all be OK. That makes populism almost directly opposed to science.

Scientific truths are complex. Understanding how an invisible, harmless gas can trap heat in the atmosphere because of its molecular shape is not easy. The claim that if a child gets ill shortly after being vaccinated, that doesn't mean the vaccine caused the illness, is counter-intuitive, as is -- conversely -- saying that just because someone gets better after taking homeopathy, that doesn't mean the homeopathy made them better.

Science deals in uncertainty, and in often counter-intuitive fact.

""Climate change is not dangerous; it's a liberal hoax"" is a more reassuring message than ""climate change is real and going to make things much worse."" It's also easier to understand. The only drawback is that it's false.

The public may have had enough of experts, but as the winter bushfires in Australia show, that doesn't mean the experts are wrong.",https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/20/opinions/populist-skeptics-science-opinion-intl/index.html,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['1', '1', '1', '1', '1']"
38Z7YZ2SB4KGTZKM929NLC4UXO3IQS,Fastest growing county in every US state,"CLOSE People are apparently feeling so good about the current economy that Americans quit their jobs in May at the fastest rate since 2001. Buzz60

The United States has added about 17 million people since the last major census in 2010, a 5.3% population growth. The increase has been steady over that time, at 0.7% to 0.8% a year. This growth, however, does little to reflect the constantly shifting landscape of this country, where over 1 in 10 people move each year. Examining population change at a more local level, the county level, reveals that nationwide there are places that have lost more than 10% of the population since 2010, while there are places that added more than 20% to their populations. While population growth rates vary, nearly every state in the country has at least one county or county equivalent where the population grew at a faster rate than the nation as a whole since 2010. Reviewing population change figures from the Census Bureau from July 2010 through July 2017, 24/7 Wall St. identified the fastest growing county in each state. In states that do not have counties, we reviewed what the Census Bureau treats as the equivalent to a county. For the United States as a whole, natural growth -- births minus deaths -- accounts for the largest source of population growth. Following natural growth, immigration from other countries accounts for the rest of the population growth. In most of the fastest growing counties in each state, however, the lionâ€™s share of population growth is due mostly to domestic migration. The reasons Americans move to a certain place differ from county to county. Some counties have booming economies, evidenced by job growth and low unemployment. Others benefit from ongoing migration patterns from the Snow Belt and Midwest to the Sun Belt. Still others represent affordable housing opportunities as home prices continue to rise in the post-recession housing market recovery. To identify the fastest growing county in every state, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the seven-year population estimate change from the U.S Census Bureauâ€™s Annual Estimates of the Resident Population from July 2010-July 2017. Only counties with a base population (from April 2010) greater than 10,000 were considered. If a county had a seven year population growth but either a two or three year population decline, it was excluded. Annual unemployment figures at both the state and county level are from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and are 2017 annual figures. (Photo: littleny / iStock)

35YHTYFL1HLOOGEDUTXCO2QAY04VFA,"Judge Kavanaughâ€™s Former Clerks: Diverse, and Deployed to Vouch for Him","Another touched on fashion advice. â€œEarly in my clerkship, the judge called me into his office and said he noticed that my collar was curling up in front,â€ wrote Eric Hansford, a clerk from 2011 to 2012 who is now an assistant United States attorney in Washington. â€œHe pulled down his tie, took the collar stays out his own shirt, and handed them to me. The next morning, I came in to find a pile of collar stays on my chair. I still use those collar stays.â€

An endorsement letter signed by 34 former clerks â€” â€œevery single one of Judge Kavanaughâ€™s clerks not prohibited by their current or pending employment from signing,â€ according to the letter â€” was also sent to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who is the committeeâ€™s ranking member.

â€œWe never once saw him take a shortcut, treat a case as unimportant, or search for an easy answer,â€ the letter reads. â€œInstead, in each case, large or small, he masters every detail and rereads every precedent. He listens carefully to the views of his colleagues and clerks, even â€” indeed, especially â€” when they differ from his own.â€

The letter points out that the former clerks now serve as â€œprosecutors, professors, state and federal public officials, and attorneys at private law firms, corporations, and nonprofits,â€ adding, â€œOur ranks include Republicans, Democrats, and independents.â€

Two of Judge Kavanaughâ€™s former clerks are married: John Bash, a clerk from 2006 to 2007, finished his year with Judge Kavanaugh a month before his wife, Zina Bash, signed on. Mr. Bash went on to clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia, and Ms. Bash, for Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. Mr. Bash is the United States attorney for the Western District of Texas, and Ms. Bash is senior counsel for Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general. Ms. Bash was previously Mr. Trumpâ€™s special assistant for regulatory reform, legal and immigration policy.

Mr. Bashâ€™s statement praised Mr. Kavanaughâ€™s â€œpersonal integrity, intellectual rigor, fairness, open-mindedness and fundamental decency.â€ Ms. Bash called Judge Kavanaugh â€œan enthusiastic role model to so many women.â€ In emails, the couple said they were not speaking in an official capacity.

Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, a progressive group urging Democrats to vote against any nominee on conservative groupsâ€™ list of preferred candidates, said the focus on Judge Kavanaughâ€™s staff is part of â€œa purposeful effort to cast himself in a light that is favorable to women because heâ€™s anticipating that his views on abortion and contraception are going to be major issues in his confirmation.â€",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/us/politics/kavanaugh-supreme-court-clerks.html,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Republican', 'Neutral']","['1', '2', '1', '1', '2']"
3511RHPADWWIV17S7KV0II6RAH1LRI,Mollie Tibbetts: Police charge man with murder of missing college student after body discovered,"Police have charged a man with murder after they discovered what is believed to be the body of a missing college student.

Cristhian Behena Rivera would face a mandatory life sentence if convicted of killing 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts, who had been missing for more than a month in the US state of Iowa.

Investigators announced Mr Rivera had been charged at a press conference hours after they found what is thought to be the University of Iowa student's body in a field covered in corn stalks.

Ms Tibbetts was last seen on 18 July in Brooklyn, her rural hometown of around 1,400 people, as she took a routine evening jog.

It is unclear whether or not she returned to the home where she was dog-sitting for her boyfriend and her boyfriend's brother. Her family reported her missing the following day.

Tibbetts' disappearance set off a massive search involving dozens of officers from the FBI, as well as state and local agencies.

Last week, vice president Mike Pence met privately with the Tibbetts family during a visit to Iowa and reportedly told them they were ""on the hearts of every American.""

Investigators say they used surveillance video in tracking down Mr Rivera and had obtained footage showing Ms Tibbetts jogging in a rural area near Brooklyn as well as the suspect's car.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents said in a statement Mr Rivera was a Mexican citizen who had been in the country illegally.

The agency believed the suspect had been living in the state for four to seven years prior to the incident.

He is now being held on a federal immigration detainer, investigators said.

Ms Tibbetts, a psychology major, would have started her junior year at college this week in Iowa City, around 50 miles east of Brooklyn.

She had been staying with her long-time boyfriend and working while home from school over the summer.

3087LXLJ6NY8VFDXRW9N390K44S0FO,"After New York's electoral upset, eyes turn to Massachusetts","BOSTON (AP) -- Ayanna Pressley knew it was going to be tough mounting a primary challenge to an incumbent Democratic congressman in Massachusetts, a state that often rewards politicians with near-lifetime jobs.

Then someone Pressley counts as a friend -- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- stunned the New York Democratic establishment, and the nation, with her primary victory last month over 10-term U.S. Rep. Joe Crowley.

Suddenly, the 44-year-old black Boston city councilor's efforts to unseat U.S. Rep. Michael Capuano -- another longtime white, male, middle-aged politician -- in the state's Sept. 4 primary seems less far-fetched.

""Alex and her race is an inspiring one because it challenges conventional wisdom and narratives about who has a right to run and when, and who can win,"" Pressley said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""We have to be disruptive in our democracy and our policy-making and how we run and win elections.""

The Massachusetts contest is yet another reminder of the rifts tearing at the Democratic Party, with more liberal, often younger voters calling for a newer, more diverse leadership.

Capuano, 66, said he understands the urge among some for new faces.

""If that's what people want. That's fine. That's not new: 'Throw the bums out' is in pretty much every campaign ever,'"" he told the AP. ""As a generic statement, that's one thing. It's a different thing when you take that generic statement and apply it to individuals.""

One challenge for Democratic voters in the state's 7th Congressional District may be finding policy differences between the two. Capuano is among the most liberal House members, not leaving much room on the left for Pressley.

It's a point Capuano, first elected to the House in 1998, has tried to hammer home, pointing to his high ratings with progressive groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP, Planned Parenthood and the AFL-CIO.

""My record is pretty clear. I'm one of the most progressive members of Congress and have been since I got here,"" Capuano said. ""I think I've effectively represented every constituent group in this district.""

Pressley said the argument that she and Capuano will vote the same way misses a bigger point about leadership and building coalitions -- a philosophy she said she's used during her years at City Hall to address issues like schools, transportation and public safety.

""This is Massachusetts. Every Democrat is going to vote the same way,"" Pressley said. ""The hate that is coming out of this White House will not be defeated by a reliable vote on the floor of Congress. The hate coming out of this White House will be defeated by a movement and a coalition.""

Paul Watanabe, professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, says the nation's unsettled political times mean few free rides anymore for incumbents facing challenges from within their parties -- a reality he said Capuano understands.

""Mike Capuano did not need a wake-up call like this to take this race seriously. I think he's taking it as a serious challenge and Ayanna Pressley is determined to try to do in Massachusetts what was accomplished in New York,"" Watanabe said.

""The lesson of the 2016 election at the highest level is all things are possible.""

Capuano has a fundraising edge. His campaign said he collected $680,000 in the past three months, bringing his cash total to $1.4 million. Pressley raised $370,000 during the same period, her campaign said.

One issue where there might be a sliver of daylight between the two is on the future of the federal government's chief immigration enforcement agency Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.

Pressley has called for defunding the agency. Capuano said he voted against the creation of ICE, but thinks changing policies is more important.

The district -- redrawn in 2011 to become Massachusetts' first ""minority-majority"" district -- includes a wide swath of Boston and about half of Cambridge as well as portions of neighboring Chelsea, Everett, Randolph, Somerville and Milton. It includes both Cambridge's Kendall Square -- experiencing a white hot development boom -- and the neighborhood of Roxbury, the center of Boston's traditionally black community. If elected, Pressley, who has served on the city council since 2010, would be the only black member of the state's congressional delegation.

Clarrissa Croppers, co-owner the Frugal Bookstore in Roxbury, said gentrification, particularly the price of housing, is one of her top issues.

""I understand that they want to clean up the area, but I don't want them to clean out the people who've been here for so long,"" the 37-year-old said.

""I'm going to vote for (Pressley); she's been a supporter of my business before she ran,"" Croppers added. ""I've not ever seen Mike come in here. You will see him closer to election time. They want to come out, shake hands and do photos, but where were you months and years before?""

Pressley's campaign is also a challenge to an unwritten ""wait your turn"" rule in the Massachusetts Democratic Party, where incumbents can hang onto seats for decades with few if any serious competitors.

The last successful Democratic primary challenge in Massachusetts came in 2014, when Seth Moulton defeated incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. John Tierney in the state's 6th Congressional District.

Pressley is aware she's bucking a tide.

3VZYA8PITPGGTIK8LKWEHX97FAE50A,Purged! Bernie Sanders No Longer Left Enough Because Hesitant to Abolish ICE,"Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is no longer left enough for some Democrats, because he has been reluctant to join calls to abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Thatâ€™s according to the New Republic, once a reliable center-left organ. Writer Sarah Jones has declared that Sanders is â€œundermining his position as the nationâ€™s most prominent left-wing politicianâ€ by suggesting that ICE should be reformed, rather than endorsing the total elimination of border enforcement.

Jones writes:

Sanders could be a source of consistent, left-wing pressure on party leadership, whether or not he runs in 2020. If he intends to build a lasting political movement out of the remnants of his last presidential campaign, heâ€™ll need to become an effective counterweight to the mainstream Democratic Party. But based on his ICE comments and the uneven results of his campaign efforts, Sanders no longer seems like such a sure figurehead for disgruntled Democratic voters.

While Sanders has inspired many on the left, including newest Democratic Party heroine Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, his refusal to abolish ICE outright, Jones argues, means that perhaps he was never such a thought leader after all. â€œ[D]espite his sudden popularity in 2015, Sanders has never been a figurehead to everyone in the American left. â€¦ He does not occupy the left-most band of the spectrum,â€ Jones writes.

She goes on to list his apparent heresies, including his reluctance to call for the nationalization of industry:

Itâ€™s certainly true that Sanders is to the left of most Democrats. But contrary to how heâ€™s often portrayed in the media, he is not a doctrinaire leftist. â€¦ Sanders is not a revolutionary. His views arenâ€™t even entirely consistent with democratic socialism, the political tradition he claims. Itâ€™s one thing to call for breaking up the big banks, and quite another to call for the nationalization of private industries.

The fact that Sanders stopped short of joining calls to abolish ICE turns out to be the latest heterodoxy â€” and, for Jones, it is the last straw. In fact, she says, Sanders is basically a â€œmainstream politicianâ€ who has no real claim to left-wing credentials but for the fact that American political discourse has shifted so far to the right.

In contrast, those who have passed the Democratsâ€™ new litmus test include Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

3W3RSPVVGT9ABTZ9BEQ5NTTBHG5LUM,The Goutte dâ€™Or â€“ emerging design hub of Paris,"â€œWhat I really like is the feeling of being in a village,â€ said furniture designer Fabrice Daigremont. â€œEveryone knows each other. If you need advice or to borrow a tool, you can just pop into one of the other workshops and someone will be able to help.â€ Daigremont, who designs and makes high-end lamps, tables and stools alongside his work as an architect, is talking about the Goutte dâ€™Or district of north Paris, where he has a showroom and workshop.

Itâ€™s just a few minutesâ€™ walk from the tourist-choked cobbles and souvenir shops of Montmartre, but could be a different world.

The Goutte dâ€™Or is a burgeoning creative hub, with young jewellery and fashion designers setting up shop next to textile workshops, fashion and accessories boutiques, makers of leather goods and upmarket furniture, like Daigremont.

Fashion label Maison ChÃ¢teau Rouge is another brand based in the area that has taken off, with its blend of African culture and contemporary cuts. The label has recently created a clothing and homeware line now being stocked in major French chain Monoprix.

But design hub is just one of the Goutte dâ€™Orâ€™s identities: itâ€™s also one of the last surviving traditional working-class neighbourhoods in the French capital, albeit one whose streets are fast gentrifying.

And itâ€™s known as â€˜Little Africaâ€™ thanks to a decades-long wave of immigration from former French colonies that has lent the area a cosmopolitan vibe: tiny restaurants serve up chicken in peanut-based mafÃ© sauce from Mali and spicy Senegalese fish stew, bissap (hibiscus) and plantain are on offer in the open-air market and fabric shops piled high with the traditional and colourful West African â€˜waxâ€™ fabrics, decorated with lively batik prints, brighten up the Parisian grey.

A new generation of artisans has taken inspiration from the areaâ€™s African aesthetic

The textile skills that immigrants from Africa have brought to the Goutte dâ€™Or are part of the reason this web of around 20 small streets â€“ wedged between boulevard BarbÃ¨s, rue Stephenson, rue Ordener and boulevard de la Chapelle â€“ is now thriving as a creative hub, explains Christian Pechereau, coordinator of Les Gouttes Dâ€™Or de la Mode et du Design.

This association was set up eight years ago to support, develop and communicate about the skills of a new generation of artisans, many of whom have taken inspiration from the areaâ€™s African aesthetic â€“ and all of whom want to create something new, and attract new customers.

Helped by some public funding, it also aims to aid the transformation of a neighbourhood whose social and economic difficulties â€“ from high levels of unemployment to drug dealing and other street crime â€“ have led to an off-putting reputation for visitors.

Creative hub

â€œOur goal as an association is to pool our resources and communicate better about the skills and savoir-faire we have in the area, to bring it to a wider audience,â€ said Pechereau, speaking among the mannequins and patterned samples in the associationâ€™s showroom, on the cobbled rue des Gardes, where several new retail premises have helped attract creative businesses to the area, giving it a more welcoming vibe.

Design destinations are good as they give the public a snapshot of the local industry â€“ Trevyn McGowan

The Goutte dâ€™Or is by no means the only neighbourhood to have seen the potential in local creativity. In Finlandâ€™s capital, which was World Design Capital in 2012, Design District Helsinki has been helping local creative businesses across the design spectrum to work together and attract tourists and locals alike to witness their design talents since 2005. It now has 220 members. â€œHelsinki has a strong design heritage and is using design to improve city life,â€ said Piia Lehtinen, president of the board of Design District Helsinki. â€œWe support the cityâ€™s image as a design city.â€

And in Cape Town, South Africa, the area around the Southern Guild gallery run by design duo Trevyn and Julian McGowan is emerging as a design focal point in the recently renovated V&amp;A Waterfront area of the city.â€œWeâ€™re big believers in community and collaboration and a hub helps that,â€ said Trevyn McGowan. â€œDesign destinations are good as they give the public a snapshot of the local industry and create a design-savvy and design-proud public, which is essential for the development of the industry.â€

Back in Paris, the Goutte dâ€™Or association organises its own events and teams up with initiatives like Paris Design Week in order to attract visitors and to show what an often-overlooked part of Paris has to offer.

The association is thriving, with around 40 members benefitting from link-ups with museums, social media campaigns and open-workshop events, which are starting to get the message across.

It hasnâ€™t been easy, however. â€œItâ€™s starting to change â€“ some people want to go off the beaten track â€“ but often the people who pass by donâ€™t have the spending power to visit these boutiques,â€ said Pechereau.

â€œThe association aims to draw visitors here so they can see that our designers make objects that are original and much cheaper than elsewhere,â€ Pechereau added, giving the example of jewellery designer Dominique Petris who uses everything from razor-shell clams to leather, antique glass and paste paper in her designs, and has been based in the Goutte dâ€™Or for 17 years.

Her creations sell more easily in a boutique in the chic 8th arrondissement of Paris, than in her own workshop in the rue des Gardes, Pechereau says. Two years ago members of the association formed a textile cooperative, which has allowed them to win high-profile contracts including making historically accurate period clothes for museums and costumes for operas.

The cooperative began with three members, now has nine, and has more than doubled its turnover in two years. There are plans to open a shared workshop space in 2018 to allow it to accept bigger contracts and grow further.

Saloum Fadel, who runs Fadel Couture, a textile workshop in the heart of the Goutte dâ€™Or, also helps to manage the cooperative. Having successfully steered his own business towards high-end work such as making prototypes for designers including AgnÃ¨s B, to weather a widespread downturn in the textile industry, Fadel sees the importance of highlighting local savoir-faire in order to aid economic growth.

Local artisans are benefitting from a renewed appreciation of the skills the Goutte dâ€™Or has to offer, says Fadel, who is originally from Mauritania but has been in France for almost 28 years. â€œThereâ€™s now an undisputable value attached to the â€˜Made in Franceâ€™ label â€“ businesses that moved production to China and Eastern Europe are coming back because the quality wasnâ€™t there and customers are more and more conscious of the conditions their clothes are manufactured in.â€

Fadel agrees with Daigremont that cooperation among neighbours is a big plus for the neighbourhood. â€œThere are people here from so many different nationalities,â€ he said. â€œThereâ€™s a real sense of solidarity in the Goutte dâ€™Or. Thatâ€™s where the idea for the cooperative came from. Thereâ€™s a richness in reaching out to other people, sharing and giving something back.â€

3ZVPAMTJWOL299TRWTYK5Q1JE0FGR7,'Nazis Go Home!' Police Arrest Dozens as Jeff Sessions Visits L.A.,"Police arrested 25 demonstrators protesting the Trump administrationâ€™s immigration policies ahead of Attorney General Jeff Sessionsâ€™ scheduled visit to Los Angeles on Tuesday.

Tuesdayâ€™s protest outside the federal courthouse in downtown Los Angeles comes hours before Sessions is expected to address the conservative Criminal Justice Legal Foundationâ€™s annual meeting. The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), and several other pro-open-border groups, led the protests through the cityâ€™s downtown core, before arriving at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel.

Scenes from protest are circulating on Twitter.

â€œAs a United Methodist, and heâ€™s a fellow United Methodist, this is not right, and this is not part of our Christian teachings or our values or our beliefs, said Rev. Allison Mack of North Hollywood United Methodist Church.

One man was spotting wearing a mask of President Donald Trump, holding a sign that reads â€œKnow your enemy.â€ â€œSessions, youâ€™re not welcome in our communities and your hatred is not welcome in our communities,â€ immigration activist Jose Montez said at the rally.

Immigrant rights advocates are demanding a judge order the release of immigrant parents separated from their children at the U.S. border and their reunification.

Attorneys on Monday asked the federal court in Los Angeles that is overseeing a longstanding settlement governing detention conditions for immigrant children to include their parents as plaintiffs.

The complaint filed by pro bono law firm Public Counsel on behalf of three Central American mothers whose children were taken from them by U.S. authorities in May argues that families need to heal from the trauma of forced separation together and outside the confines of detention.

Attorneys allege the mothers are fleeing persecution and seeking asylum in the U.S.

The Department of Justice declined comment on the matter.

The Trump administration has asked the court to let authorities detain families together during immigration proceedings to try to discourage illegal immigration.

3S37Y8CWI9IR5PHT0M6PJ0CXGJY4W6,Rep. Marshall: Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s message should be welcomed by the GOP for these reasons,"Just when we thought it was too good to be true that Democrats were still touting House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California as the face of their party, theyâ€™ve come back with an even greater gift for Republicans â€“ democratic socialist congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, running as a Democrat for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives from New York City.

Over the last several weeks we've seen a dramatic increase in discussion of socialism and what it actually means, sparked mostly by the Democrats onboarding of the 28-year-old Ocasio-Cortez after her surprise primary victory that made her a House candidate.

Many conservatives get angry at the sight of Ocasio-Cortez on TV news programs. I welcome her â€“ and the Republican Party should as well. We must appreciate the opportunity to contrast our free-market platform with the socialist ideas of a former bartender who has said she believes that ""unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs.""

Itâ€™s a no-brainer that every Republican should welcome a debate with this disciple of democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, with her many radical positions.

I was a physician in rural Kansas for almost 30 years before I was elected to Congress in 2016. So personally, I believe the most practical way we can crush the rise of democratic socialists is to tear apart their most popular proposal: Medicare for all.

There is no such thing as â€œMedicare for all.â€ That phrase in and of itself is a complete and total scam.

Medicare only exists because a free-market health-care system allows it to exist. Medicare can only function within a relatively open market system that still inspires America's best and brightest to become doctors, nurses, and health-care innovators.

If you want to see what â€œMedicare for allâ€ looks like, look no further than the last 25 years of the Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. I would encourage socialists like Ocasio-Cortez to ask a veteran dependent on the VA what he or she thinks of their government-run health care â€“ but Ocasio-Cortez won't do that.

It is no secret that despite the strides President Trump and this Congress have made, there is still much work to be done for our vets when it comes to offering them quality health care.

No pundit, politician or health-care professional can deny that due entirely to the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and government-mandated electronic medical records, more physicians and nurses are quitting or opting for early retirement than ever before.

What it all comes down to is control versus choice. The Democrats (socialists) fundamentally believe that Washington knows whatâ€™s best for you and your family â€“ better than you do. In contrast, the Republican Party still strongly believes that when given choices in the marketplace of products, ideas and health care, the individual knows whatâ€™s best for his or her family.

Socialized medicine means agencies would have the power to decide which doctor you take your children to, or what hospital should treat your aging parents and relatives. A vote for these socialist Democrats means rationing health-care services, waiting months to see a primary care physician, and waiting two to three years for joint replacement or a basic heart catheterization.

There will be a government-coded formula for deciding which patients â€“ if any â€“ will be treated for Stage 4 cancer, dialysis or an organ transplant. Socialists and the modern Democratic Party know that as soon as they control your health-care, they control you.

The key to the Democratic (socialist) success is that they need you to be convinced that you need them. Just don't ask them how they're going to pay the $3 trillion per year price tag.

At its core, socialism is a pseudo-religious belief that big-government central planning can take what it wants and give what it wants. It is that very same reason why socialism always ends up dying by the same sword â€“ tyranny.

Once socialism fails, there is nowhere else for the individual to turn. Because of the inevitable failure of socialism, the only people that prosper under its tyranny are the apparatchiks who control the central government. They always live well, while everyone elseâ€™s families descend into horrific poverty.

For example, Google ""Venezuela"" â€“ where some people in what was once a wealthy country eat out of dumpsters. Or research why China and Vietnam abandoned their failed â€œfive-year plans"" of government-controlled economies and turned to free enterprise incentives so that they could feed their people.

Countries quickly learned that in the measly five acres their farmers were permitted to grow corps for sale at free-enterprise-based â€œfarmers markets,â€ they produced more food than 100 acres they farmed for the state.

History is littered with the tattered remains of the socialist dogma of Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez and now the Democratic Partyâ€™s midterm platform.

Ocasio-Cortez and the socialists in Congress like to fly the banner of open borders and immigration. Well, I don't know a single immigrant in Kansas who dreamed of coming to the United States chasing the beaming light of socialism. Iâ€™ll be damned if I turn my country and my grandchildrenâ€™s future over to socialism.

Defeating the Democrats and their socialist poster candidates will remain our priority this fall, and we will succeed. In the meantime, Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are welcome back to my home state of Kansas anytime; they spend money in the state and get votes for the Republican Party.",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/08/30/rep-marshall-ocasio-cortez-s-message-should-be-welcomed-by-gop-for-these-reasons.html,"['Strongly Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Neutral']","['2', '1', '2', '2', '1']"
36GJS3V78W8LBLAEOOPB3ZFS4JLGJF,Melania Trump Is Redefining One of the World's Weirdest Jobs,"It was all Melania's idea. The statement rebuking her husband's immigration policy. The hastily arranged trip to the southern border. Even the jacket-oh, God, the jacket. From the beginning of her husband's term, First Lady Melania Trump has been mysterious, private to the point of secretive, seldom seen and even less often heard. As outrage over the Administration's policy of separating children from their parents peaked, the First Lady-herself an immigrant who came to America seeking a better life-took it upon herself to speak up. But the message was so inscrutable that the mystery only deepened.

On Father's Day, the First Lady released an unprecedented statement not so subtly taking issue with the policy. Without consulting her husband, she planned a June 21 trip to an unaccompanied-children's center in McAllen, Texas, according to her office. Whatever message was intended, it was overtaken by the words on the back of the green jacket she wore as she boarded the plane: i really don't care. do u?

Every First Lady bears the burden of having one of the world's weirdest jobs. It comes with no salary or fixed portfolio but plenty of star power, expectations and scrutiny. Most of the office's recent occupants have combined spouse-supporting symbolism with a set of pet policies. Melania Trump, by contrast, has offered only the merest glimpses of her life and the vaguest semblance of a platform. Which is why the jacket became a fresh token for speculation on the meaning of Melania. As with other women who put up with problematic men-from Hillary Clinton to Harvey Weinstein's assistants-we can't decide whether she's victim or accomplice. And her silence only deepens the mystery.

The enigma begins with the Trumps' unusual relationship. The President's third wife, 23 years his junior, cried on election night, according to Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury. She didn't move to Washington for nearly six months after the Inauguration so that their only child, 12-year-old Barron, could finish the school year in New York City. She and her husband sleep in separate rooms, according to the New York Times. Barron now attends a private school in the D.C. suburbs. Melania's parents, Slovenian citizens who are legal permanent residents of the U.S., are rumored to reside in the area.

In early May, 16 months after her husband took office, Melania unveiled her official program, a three-pronged mission to encourage healthy living, fight opioid abuse and counter cyberbullying. Then, on May 15, the White House announced that Melania was at a Washington-area hospital for a procedure to treat a ""benign kidney condition."" The procedure, a surgical treatment known as embolization, is a minor one, but she didn't resurface until 24 days later. Her husband tweeted a combative explanation for her postsurgery absence that amplified the rumors: ""During her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death, to face-lift, to left the W.H. (and me) for N.Y. or Virginia, to abuse,"" he wrote. ""All Fake, she is doing really well!""

Other public comments only deepen the mystery. On June 7, Rudy Giuliani, the President's lawyer, said the First Lady believed her husband's denial that he had trysted with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, in 2006. Said the First Lady's spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham: ""I don't believe Mrs. Trump has ever discussed her thoughts on anything with Mr. Giuliani.""

At the border shelter in McAllen, Melania asked children a series of factual questions: ""Where are you from?"" and ""How old are you?"" She didn't hug them or ask about their feelings. Then she got back on the plane, where the cable-news firestorm over the $39 jacket had already erupted. When she got off, she was wearing the jacket again. Worn by a civilian on the street, it would be a tart declaration of aloof detachment, a little bitchy, a little confrontational. But in the context of the trip, it was sharply at odds with her mission. The First Lady and her staff declined to offer an explanation. ""It's a jacket. There was no hidden message,"" Grisham said. The President then undermined that statement with a tweet claiming the jacket was a message to the ""Fake News Media.""

Donald Trump's Secret Service name is Mogul; Melania's is Muse. As a model and celebrity wife, she's surely accustomed to being looked at. Women, especially beautiful ones, have long understood that there's nothing so tantalizing as something you can't understand. Now Melania's actions raise the most tantalizing question of all. If she really doesn't care, what might she do next?",https://www.yahoo.com/news/melania-trump-redefining-one-world-101349079.html,"['Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic']","['1', '5', '2', '1', '3']"
3TD33TP5DMKEJBZZEWKK9PLCYSCAB7,Oregon's sanctuary state policies could be repealed in November,"Oregon could start allowing its law enforcement officers to cooperate with federal immigration officials if voters choose to repeal its sanctuary status in November.

A measure to repeal the so-called sanctuary state status â€“ which regulates how much local law enforcement officials can help federal immigration authorities â€“ will be on the November ballot, The Oregonian reported.

Oregon has been a sanctuary state since 1987, making the law the oldest in the nation. It prohibits law enforcement agencies from using â€œagency monies, equipment or personnel for the purpose of detecting or apprehending persons whose only violation of law isâ€ that they are in â€œviolation of federal immigration laws.â€

The Trump administration has been opposed to sanctuary cities and states, promising to crack down on them.

Andrea Williams, executive director of immigrant rights organization Causa Oregon, warned that if the sanctuary status is rescinded, police officers would begin to racially profile people in the state.

WHAT IS A SANCTUARY CHURCH? A LOOK AT THE POLICY AND ITS LEGALITY IN THE US

â€œNo Oregonian, including those who may be undocumented immigrants, should have to live in fear that doing basic things like going to work or school or reporting a crime to police could result in harassment or their families being torn apart,â€ Williams said in a statement.

The group Oregonians United Against Profiling said businesses such as Nike and Columbia Sportswear back opposition to the proposal, formally called Initiative Petition 22 (IP 22).

According to The Oregonian, two groups were instrumental in garnering more than 97,000 signatures by July 6 to get the initiative on the November ballot: Oregonians for Immigration Reform and Stop Oregon Sanctuaries.

NEBRASKA TOWN MIGHT BAR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS FROM JOBS, RENTING HOUSES

â€œAll are eager to end Oregon's sanctuary policy and see their state do its part to combat, not promote, illegal immigration by freeing our police and sheriffs to cooperate fully with federal immigration authorities to enforce U.S. immigration law,â€ Cynthia Kendall, Oregonians for Immigration Reform president, said in a statement to Fox News.

â€œVoters seldom get an opportunity to vote on immigration issues,â€ she previously told KOPB-FM. â€œWe should get to decide do we want to repeal this or not. My guess, and our polling shows, yes we want to repeal that.â€

Bob Dane, executive director of the right-leaning Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), praised the groupsâ€™ â€œherculean effortâ€ to get IP 22 on the ballot.

â€œOregon lawmakers have repeatedly demonstrated their contempt for concerns that Oregon citizens have about rampant illegal immigration,â€ Dane told Fox News.

Last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticized Portland while visiting the west coast city, dubbing it a â€œtraffickerâ€™s, a smugglerâ€™s or gang memberâ€™s best friendâ€ because of its sanctuary policies.

â€œThink about that: Police may be forced to release pedophiles, rapists, murderers, drug dealers and arsonists back into communities where they had no right to be in the first place,â€ Sessions said at the time. â€œThey should, according to law and common sense, be processed and deported.â€

Senate

â— IN-Sen: Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly's new ad features a constituent identified as Jordan McLinn describing how her four-year-old son Jordan was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and she had no hope he would survive. She then says she learned there was a drug out there that could help Jordan, but the family couldn't get it. McLinn praises Donnelly for his support for ""right to try,"" a recently enacted law that allows terminally ill patients to seek drug treatments that are still in the clinical trial stage.

Donnelly then appears and says it's his job to help people like Jordan. The spot then shows a clip of Trump signing the legislation and declaring, ""Sen. Donnelly, thank you very much.""

â— MO-Sen: The Club for Growth is up with what Politico reports is a $2 million ad against Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. The narrator argues that McCaskill and her husband got rich ever since she got elected, and hits the senator for spending ""big bucks chartering a private plane with public funds, a plane [the couple] co-owned."" The commercial goes on to declare that her husband has ""made a boatload investing in a Cayman Islands hedge fund.""

McCaskill's campaign quickly noted that her husband was already wealthy when they married four years before she was elected to the Senate, that she reimbursed the treasury when she used a private plane, and that her husband's hedge fund is based in Massachusetts.

â— MS-Sen-B: GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith is up with a spot declaring that she's kept the conservative values in the Senate that she had as a state senator and agriculture commissioner, including ""supporting conservative judges appointed by President Trump.""

â— ND-Sen: The NRSC recently launched their first TV ad of the cycle, and we now know they put $330,000 behind it.

â— WI-Sen: While businessman Kevin Nicholson's allies have spent many months and many millions of dollars running ads on his behalf ahead of the Aug. 14 GOP primary, the candidate himself is only going up with his first TV spot this week. Nicholson declares that he and his fellow Marines didn't serve in Iraq and Afghanistan ""to let career politicians waste this moment,"" adding, ""The fact that Congress won't build President Trump's wall, repeal Obamacare, and refuses to end illegal immigration is a disgrace to everything we've ever fought for.""

â— WV-Sen: The GOR firm Trafalgar Group is out with a poll giving Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin a 50-40 lead over Republican Patrick Morrisey. The poll did not include Don Blankenship, who is trying to get on the ballot as a conservative third-party candidate (but may not be able to). The result isn't much different than what Democratic and independent polls have shown since the GOP primary ended two months ago.

Manchin got some other good news when Politico reported that One Nation, a nonprofit close to the GOP leadership, had canceled $750,000 in planned TV and radio spending for the next week that was to attack the incumbent as weak on immigration. It seems extremely unlikely that Team Red could be backing away from this very red state this early in the cycle even with Manchin ahead in the polls, but we'll want to keep an eye out to see if other major outside groups redirect their resources.

Gubernatorial

â— AZ-Gov: While Republican Gov. Doug Ducey might not have appeared especially vulnerable at the start of this election cycle, things seem different now. The limited polling we've seen has shown a close race, and while it's mostly come from Democrats, Republicans haven't answered with any data of their own. What they have done is book TV ad time for the fall to shore up Ducey, an unexpected move given how many other governorships they have to defend this year.

In general, Arizona's looking more competitive than it has in some time. The state's open Senate race is naturally drawing more attention, but the governor's race has the chance to surprise us further. Ducey, as the incumbent in what's still a red state, retains the advantage, but regardless of which Democrat emerges from the Aug. 28 primary to take him on, that advantage has narrowed. As such, we're moving our rating from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

â— GA-Gov: On behalf of the local Fox affiliate, Opinion Savvy is out with a poll of Tuesday's GOP primary runoff that gives Secretary of State Brian Kemp a huge 55-37 lead over Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle. The poll was conducted Tuesday and Wednesday, so much of it would have been completed before Trump backed Kemp on Wednesday afternoon. Kemp is making the most out of Trump's unexpected endorsement, and he quickly put together a TV spot promoting it. Mike Pence has also announced that he'll hold a rally for Kemp on Saturday.

â— KS-Gov: Former state Sen. and 2006 nominee Jim Barnett is out with a TV spot ahead of the Aug. 7 GOP primary that focuses on him and his running mate and wife, Rosie Hansen, pretty much equally. The commercial features two people from Barnett's old company praising him and Hansen for having a great business partnership, declaring they support ""more money for schools"" and expanding Medicaid. While the narrators don't say the team is married, the commercial does show Barnett and Hansen at what appears to be their wedding.

â— MN-Gov, MN-08: MinnPost's Sam Brodey reported on Thursday that Rep. Rick Nolan, who is Attorney General Lori Swanson's running mate in Minnesota's Aug. 14 Democratic primary for governor, hired a former aide for his 2016 re-election campaign even though the aide had previously left Nolan's legislative staff after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment. The staffer, legislative director Jim Swiderski, left both posts without any public acknowledgment at the time about the allegations against him.

Eight women who had worked for Nolan in Congress or on his campaign spoke to MinnPost for the story, including three with specific allegations against Swiderski and five others who offered corroborating details. One intern, identified in the story as Rachel, says that Swiderski groped her multiple times while a former staffer, identified as Amanda, says that he'd sent her ""very creepy"" messages and comments on her appearance. Amanda complained about Swiderski to Nolan's chief of staff, Jodie Torkelson, and says that Torkelson acknowledged Swiderski's behavior was inappropriate; another woman also told Brodey she'd gone to Torkelson about Swiderski.

Several sources recount to Brodey that in mid-2015 Nolan, Torkelson, and district director Jeff Anderson agreed that Swiderski needed to leave the office. However, Anderson announced that Swiderski was resigning to pursue a presidential appointment to the Peace Corps, and the office even held a send-off party for him.

The next year, Swiderski was back in Minnesota, working remotely on behalf of Nolan's re-election campaign in the 8th District as an independent contractor; an unnamed source told MinnPost that the congressman was the one who suggested hiring Swiderski for a remote position. However, while Swiderski worked from his hometown, he'd frequently show up at campaign events, and word quickly spread that he was once again working for Nolan.

After the campaign's finance director complained, campaign manager Joe Radinovich, who is now running to succeed Nolan in the House, successfully urged Nolan to fire Swiderski. Radinovich's email to staffers, however, didn't mention the complaints and only explained that the campaign would take on Swiderski's tasks in-house. He added, ""I suspect we'll continue to see Jim volunteer and be involved in the campaign in other ways.""

Without referring to Swiderski by name, Nolan himself gave a statement to MinnPost acknowledging he had retained a ""separated employee"" as a ""vendor"" and emphasized that Swiderski had worked outside of the campaign office. Nolan added, ""In hindsight, the vendor should not have been retained by the campaign committee.""

Several of the women interviewed for MinnPost's story said the congressman was far from supportive during the entire episode. Rachel recounted that Nolan never acknowledged how Swiderski had treated her but did point out Swiderski's house when they drove past it, remarking, ""There's your boyfriend's house."" Other aides complained that Nolan and his senior staffers didn't seem to understand how serious Swiderski's behavior was, saying Nolan himself would tell ""off-color jokes and stories,"" including one from his days in the legislature in the early 1970s when, supposedly, blindfolded lawmakers would play a ""game"" of groping secretaries.

As of Thursday afternoon, Swanson hadn't addressed the story.

â— OH-Gov: The RGA has launched their first TV spot against Democrat Richard Cordray.

The narrator declares that after both Cordray and former Gov. Ted Strickland were ""thrown out of office"" (they both narrowly lost re-election in the 2010 GOP wave), Cordray ""left to become a top Washington bureaucrat."" The commercial accuses Cordray, who was serving as head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, of having ""secretly collected hundreds of millions of credit card accounts and mortgages,"" adding he ""failed to protect our information; it was hacked over 200 times."" Strickland isn't mentioned again, but Team Red evidently thinks that he's still unpopular enough from his 2016 Senate bid and time as governor that Cordray could be damaged with the slightest association with him.

The Columbus Dispatch did a fact-check on the RGA's spot and pointed out that, while the GOP wants to make Cordray sound like some Big Brother data collecting guy, the Bureau had every right to gather this information as part of its mission to guard against financial crime. The assertion that it was ""hacked over 200 times"" comes from Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget chief who became acting director after Cordray left to run for governor and very much does not have the Bureau's best interest at heart.

Mulvaney said there were 200 ""lapses"" under Cordray, but he never revealed the extent of the breaches. And in May, Mulvaney even announced that an independent review of the Bureau's cyber security had ""concluded that 'externally facing bureau systems appear to be well-secured.'""

â— TN-Gov: While Rep. Diane Black and businessman Randy Boyd have mostly attacked one another ahead of the Aug. 2 GOP primary, they're each out with a new spot taking aim at businessman Bill Lee. Two recent polls showed Lee in third place while Black and Boyd were ahead, so this could be sign they're both worried he's surging in the final weeks of the contest.

Black's commercial sarcastically asks if Lee would be voting in the Democratic primary because he'd ""see some familiar faces on the ballot."" The narrator says that Lee gave money to both former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean, who is the Democratic frontrunner, and former Gov. and Senate candidate Phil Bredesen. He then declares, ""Too bad disgraced [former Nashville] Mayor Megan Barry isn't on the ballotâ€”Bill Lee supported her too and she pushed sanctuary city policies, gun control and abortion.""

According to The Tennessean, Lee donated a total of $1,750 to the three of them since 2005, with his Barry contribution coming in 2015. That's a drop in the bucket compared to the thousands he's given Republican candidates, but of course Black doesn't care about that.

Neither does Boyd, whose spot accuses Lee of having ""donated to disgraced liberal Democrat Mayor Megan Berry, who supported sanctuary cities."" It also says Lee served as ""state president of a group that lobbied for amnesty for illegals,"" and argues that Lee ""didn't support Donald Trump in 2016,"" which is also a charge Black recently leveled against Boyd.

Boyd isn't letting up on his attacks on Black, though. He's out with a new spot declaring that in Washington, Black's ""net worth increased by more than $40 million,"" and argues that while ""enriching herself, D.C. Diane worked to raise our taxes by $160 million, while cutting her taxes by millions."" While we initially wondered if that last bit was actually Boyd attacking Black over the GOP's tax bill, his campaign says he was really going after her for a 2002 vote in the state legislature to raise a tax on cigarettes.

â— WI-Gov: With weeks to go before the Aug. 7 Democratic primary, both former state Rep. Kelda Helen Roys and attorney Matt Flynn are up with the first TV spots of the campaign.

Roys' ad, which the campaign says is a six-figure buy, features footage of Trump nominating Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court as she declares, ""Just when you don't think it can get any worse, it does."" Roys explains that abortion is still a crime in Wisconsin, and she doesn't believe she's still fighting the same fights as her grandmother. She goes on to say she tells her girls they can't look backwards, and she pledges ""to lead Wisconsin forward from day one.""

Flynn's first spot features him declaring he's the one veteran in the huge Democratic field and ""the only one taking a stand to stop the Foxconn deal."" Flynn goes on to take aim at GOP Gov. Scott Walker's much-criticized multi-billion tax incentive package to lure the electronics company to the Milwaukee area, saying it's happening ""all while Trump and Walker put Harley-Davidson jobs at risk."" Flynn pledges to use his first day as governor to go to court to stop the deal and put the funds in schools, health care, and roads.

House

â— AZ-02: Former Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick is up with a new spot ahead of the Aug. 28 Democratic primary staring Ron Barber, who represented this area from 2012 until his defeat in 2014, and his wife, Nancy Barber. The Barbers describe the 2011 shooting where then-Rep. Gabby Giffords was badly wounded in an assassination attempt at a constituent event and Barber was also injured. They say they're working hard to prevent these tragedies from happening, and praise Kirkpatrick for being ""committed to banning assault weapons and passing universal background checks.""

Former state Rep. Matt Heinz is also out with a spot focused on guns, but this one goes negative. The narrator charges that Kirkpatrick ""bragged she'd fight gun-safety advocates every inch of the way."" It then shows 2010 footage from Kirkpatrick's unsuccessful re-election campaign to a northern Arizona seat where she says, ""and that's why I have an A-rating with the NRA.""

â— CA-49: Republican Diane Harkey has released a poll from Public Opinion Strategies giving her a 46-43 lead over Democrat Mike Levin. Harkey's move comes a little more than a week after Levin dropped a survey from The Feldman Group that showed him up 49-46.

While both sides seem to agree this contest is close right now, the money chase has been very lopsided. Levin outraised Harkey $1 million to $318,000 during the last quarter, though she threw in another $72,000 of her own money. At the end of June, Levin held a wide $850,000 to $170,000 cash-on-hand edge.

â— FL-06: St. Pete Polls takes a look at the Aug. 28 GOP primary to replace Rep. Ron DeSantis and finds a very tight contest. Former state Rep. Fred Costello and businessman and Navy veteran John Ward each take 21 percent, while businessman and former Dick Cheney advisor Michael Waltz is just behind with 20. However, the money race is a lot more lopsided. Waltaz ended June with a $617,000 to $467,000 cash-on-hand edge over Ward, while Costello was left in the dust with just $51,000 to spend.

While this Volusia County-based seat went from 52-47 Romney to 57-40, national Democrats are excited about former deputy National Security Advisor Nancy Soderberg. Soderberg continues to be a strong fundraiser, and she ended June with a $982,000 war chest. Two other Democrats also had a credible amount of cash: radiologist Stephen Sevigny, who has self-funded much of his campaign, had $366,000 in the bank, while travel agency owner John Upchurch had $172,000 on-hand.

â— FL-07: State Rep. Mike Miller is up with his first TV spot ahead of the Aug. 28 GOP primary to take on Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy. The commercial features clips of Sen. Marco Rubio (who has endorsed Miller) and Gov. Rick Scott (who has not) praising him on taxes, education, and what Rubio calls ""individual liberty.""

â— FL-15: Former state Rep. Neil Combee is up with his first TV spot ahead of the Aug. 28 GOP primary, which features the candidate stressing fiscal responsibility. The narrator then tells the audience that Combee, who briefly served in Trump's Department of Agriculture before leaving to run for Congress, is the ""only candidate trusted and appointed by President Trump.""

â— FL-27: The National Education Association has endorsed state Rep. David Richardson in next month's Democratic primary.

â— GA-07: Georgia State University professor Carolyn Bourdeaux is up with a spot ahead Tuesday's Democratic primary runoff to take on GOP Rep. Rob Woodall. Bourdeaux tells the audience that she watched the GOP destroy the Affordable Care Act while her aging parents ""were struggling with the rising cost of healthcare,"" and Trump was ""the last straw"" for her. Bourdeaux then says she's running for her 6-year-old son and children like him.

Bourdeaux is taking on wealthy businessman David Kim on Tuesday in this suburban Atlanta seat. Bourdeaux narrowly outpaced Kim 27-26 in the first round in May, and Kim outspent her $460,000 to $351,000 from May 3 to July 4 (which the FEC defines as the pre-runoff period.) Whomever wins next week will be in for a tough race against Woodall in a seat that moved from 60-38 Romney to a smaller 51-45 Trump.

â— IL-12: Democrat Brendan Kelly is up with his first general election ad, which features him in a church bemoaning how ""We're deeply, deeply divided, and folks in southern Illinois are losing faith."" He continues by saying he came back home after serving in the Navy, and that as a prosecutor he's taking on corrupt politicians from both parties and ""the drug companies who started the opioid epidemic."" Kelly concludes by calling for new leaders in both parties and declares, ""It's time to restore our faith and save southern Illinois.""

â— IN-09: Freshman GOP Rep. Trey Hollingsworth brazenly carpetbagged into southern Indiana from Tennessee three years ago and won an open-seat GOP primary thanks to heavy super-PAC spending from his wealthy father. He wound up running well behind the top of the ticket in the general election, but his district's deep red lean was enough to ensure his victory.

There's a chance he may not be quite so fortunate this year. Democrat Liz Watson outraised him almost 2-to-1 last quarter, and 2018 is shaping up to be a much stronger year for Democrats than 2016. Hollingsworth can always fall back on his family wealth, and this district remains very conservative, but he's the kind of weak incumbent who could be vulnerable in a wave. It's very much a longshot for Watson, but we're putting this race on the big board, shifting it from Safe Republican to Likely Republican.

â— MN-02: CNN has unearthed a set of previously unnoticed broadcasts from Republican Rep. Jason Lewis' career as right-wing radio host, during which he unloaded a litany of misogynistic commentary. In his most disparaging remarks, he bemoaned the fact that he could no longer call women ""sluts""; opined that women were ""guided by more emotion not reason""; and even wondered whether women who consider the issue of birth control coverage when they vote are ""human being[s].""

In response to CNN's reporting, Lewis stood by his comments. A spokesperson refused to offer an apology, saying only, ""This has all been litigated before, and as Congressman Lewis has said time and time again, it was his job to be provocative while on the radio."" And indeed, Lewis' history of hate-filled rhetoric was well documented during his initial 2016 election.

However, Democratic attacks failed to stop Lewis from narrowly winning his first term in office alongside fellow woman-hater Donald Trump, who also carried Lewis' district by a similarly slim margin. Back then, Lewis refused to release his full radio show archive, claiming his comments would be taken ""out of context,"" but his views couldn't be clearer.

This year, Lewis faces a rematch against the woman he barely beat two years ago, Angie Craig. In the #MeToo era, when Democratic women have been especially fired up thanks in part to a backlash to Trump, renewed attention to Lewis' misogyny could very well help boot him from Congress.

â— NY-19: After attorney Antonio Delgado won last month's crowded and expensive Democratic primary to take on freshman GOP Rep. John Faso, Republicans immediately seemed worried about him, launching a scurrilous, racist attack over a rap album filled with social critiques that Delgado released a decade ago. But while Republicans had plenty to say about Delgado's lyrics, they fell silent when the DCCC released a post-primary poll showing Delgado up 49-42. This will be an expensive race (this Hudson Valley district straddles the pricey New York City media market), and Faso is well-financed, but Delgado is a strong fundraiser and charismatic speaker as well. This is going to be a top-tier race, which is why we're moving it from Lean Republican to Tossup.

â— OH-12: Republican Troy Balderson's latest ad tries to tie Democrat Danny O'Connor to Nancy Pelosi and ""dangerous"" Washington liberals who supposedly want middle class tax hikes and ""socialized medicine."" The narrator claims he abused his office as Franklin County recorder, alleging O'Connor used taxpayer money on ""a life coach, gifts for friends, and a radical left-wing group,"" the last of which Balderson doesn't even bother to name.

However, as the Columbus Dispatch noted, those charges are simply bogus. The ""life coach"" referenced was an attorney who provided leadership consulting for businesses and entrepreneurs, not anything resembling the motivational fitness instructor portrayed on-screen. Furthermore, O'Connor's campaign said the ""gifts"" referred to ""printing ribbon for the free veterans ID cards"" his office issued and the ""radical"" group was actually just a gender-equality group called the Women's Fund of Central Ohio. And of course, O'Connor has explicitly vowed not to support Pelosi for speaker if elected.

Balderson isn't the only one trying to link Oâ€™Connor to prominent progressive Democrats, and the Congressional Leadership Fund has dropped $253,000 on one such spot of their own. Their ad claims the ""liberal resistance"" wants to elect O'Connor as images of Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren are shown, alleging that Democrats supposedly want ""open borders.""

Meanwhile, O'Connor's latest ad decries how big corporate donors have come to dominate campaign spending, trying to ""buy elections."" He calls out Balderson for taking in $400,000 from PACs like those funded by the pharmaceutical, insurance, and oil industries, and O'Connor touts how he ""hasn't taken a dime of corporate PAC money.""

Lastly, the DCCC is making its first ad buy in the race, which the New York Times' Alex Burns reports is for roughly $250,000. Their spot hits Balderson for supporting a $2 trillion corporate tax break and backing cuts to Social Security and Medicare by raising the retirement age.

â— SC-01: State Rep. Katie Arrington's defeat of Rep. Mark Sanford in last month's Republican primary left her with almost no war chestâ€”and cracked the door just a bit for Democrat Joe Cunningham, who has raised some decent money. Arrington's position on oil drilling off the coast of South Carolina could also cause her problems in a coastal district that relies heavily on tourism and fishing. While Arrington said she supported offshore drilling during the primary, she's now unconvincingly arguing she's always been against it. Cunningham has attacked her over the issue, and Sanford hasn't made things better for his old foe by calling her new stance ""a complete lie.""

The last time this seat was open, Sanford won it 54-45 in a 2013 special election despite his past affair scandal, so it's still very tough turf for Team Blue, but Arrington's weaknesses make it worth keeping an eye on. As such, we're changing our rating from Safe Republican to Likely Republican.

â— TN-02: The group Defending Main Street, which was set up in 2013 to stop anti-establishment candidates from winning GOP primaries, is putting $97,000 behind a buy in support of Tennessee Air National Guard Lt. Col. Ashley Nickloes ahead of the Aug. 2 contest. Their ad extols Nickloes' military service, including her eight deployments since 9/11.

â— House: The DCCC added three more candidates to their Red to Blue List on Thursday: David Shapiro, who is challenging Rep. Vern Buchanan in Florida's 16th Congressional District; Liz Watson, who is facing Rep. Trey Hollingsworth in Indiana's 9th; and Ron DiNicola, who is taking on Rep. Mike Kelly in Pennsylvania's 16th. All three Democrats are competing for seats that Trump carried by double digits, but they're all bringing in a credible amount of money.

Chemnitz (Germany) (AFP) - Thousands of opponents and supporters of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's immigration policy marched Saturday through the eastern city of Chemnitz after a wave of racist violence that followed a knife killing.

The rallies, which drew 8,000 people according to police, ended peacefully although there was palpable tension at times during the evening.

Far-right protesters paraded with large portraits of victims of attacks perpetrated, they claimed, by asylum-seekers.

Some chanted ""Merkel must go"" and ""We are the people"" while waving German flags.

Anti-fascist demonstrators, meanwhile, brandished banners reading ""Chemnitz is neither grey nor brown"" and ""Heart instead of hate"".

There was a heavy police presence with reinforcements from all over Germany after they were outnumbered by thousands of neo-Nazis, football hooligans and other extremists earlier this week.

Sunday and Monday evenings saw outbreaks of street violence, triggered by the arrest of one Iraqi protester and one Syrian, suspected of stabbing a 35-year-old carpenter to death.

Following the arrests, mobs launched random street attacks against people they took to be foreigners, including an Afghan, a Syrian and a Bulgarian man.

Saturday's protests drew around 4,500 far-right supporters from various movements including the far-right anti-immigration alternative for Germany (AfD) party and the anti-Islam PEGIDA movement, according to police estimates.

Another 3,500 marched in support of Merkel's immigration policy, which has seen more than one million migrants and refugees allowed into Germany since 2015.

The government lent its support to the pro-migrant rally through Foreign Minister Heiko Maas who tweeted: ""The Second World War started 79 years ago. Germany caused unimaginable suffering in Europe. If once again people are parading today in the streets making Nazi salutes, our past history forces us to resolutely defend democracy.""

""We will not let right-wing extremists destroy our country and our democracy. Neither in Chemnitz, nor in Saxony nor anywhere in Germany. Our constitution must prevail. We must defend it. Now!"" added one of the Greens' leaders Cem Ozdemir in a tweet accompanied by a picture of him with demonstrators.

The violence and heated debate on immigration have brought back to the fore what has become the most challenging political issue for Merkel, especially in the former communist east of Germany where the AfD is the number one party in some towns and regions.

Following criticism of Merkel's earlier open door policy, her government has increasingly tightened asylum laws as conservative and far-right disquiet has grown.

After an initially jubilant welcome, the migrant influx sparked a strong backlash that saw a spate of hate crimes and swept once-fringe party AfD into parliament.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/thousands-protest-against-migrants-tense-german-town-185034920.html,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['1', '4', '1', '1', '2']"
3RSBJ6YZED8TYW5GTHBYTAW22YVOF7,New Yorker staffer resigns after falsely accusing ICE agent of having,"Image of Justin Gaertner that New Yorker fact-checker Talia Lavin posted about on Twitter, mistakenly implying that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent had a Nazi tattoo. ICE

The fact checker for the New Yorker who mistook a Marine veteran's tattoo for a Nazi symbol has resigned, saying the ""small mistake"" has ruined her life.

Talia Lavin is out of a job following her June 18 tweet that caused mass outrage.

""I feel like I made a small mistake and it's destroyed my life,"" she told New York Magazine's The Cut.

But the ink, ICE later explained, is really of a ""Titan 2"" symbol for his platoon when he served in Afghanistan.

Lavin posted a mea culpa on Twitter last week and announced she quit her job.

""To Justin Gaertner, I apologize, sincerely: all I saw in you was the photo ICE tweeted, and not the human being depicted inside it,"" she wrote. ""It was uncharitable, and the hasty deletion doesn't change that. I'm sorry and I have voluntarily resigned after three years at the New Yorker.""

Lavin said her decision came after she ""realized I had become a weapon used to discredit my colleagues and the vital work they do holding power to account.""

Her Gaertner tweet prompted a scathing response from ICE, which demanded she and the New Yorker apologize for ""baselessly slandering"" him.

Lavin slammed ICE, saying ""I do not think it is acceptable for a federal agency to target a private citizen for a good faith, hastily rectified error.""

She also noted, ""ICE also lied about me, saying I originated the scrutiny of Gaertner's tattoo, misspelling my name and misstating my job"" as the story quickly went viral.

""This has been painful and scary, and as I move into an uncertain and financially precarious future, I will be focusing on my writing and any other freelance work I can find,"" she wrote before asking for donations and linking to her PayPal page.",https://nypost.com/2018/06/26/new-yorker-staffer-resigns-after-falsely-accusing-ice-agent-of-having-nazi-tattoo/,"['Neutral', 'Strongly Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Democratic', 'Neutral']","['1', '3', '1', '5', '1']"
3JHB4BPSFLRNIYRJ583A8J5REAUQ9J,Illegal immigrant charged with first-degree murder in Mollie Tibbetts' death,"An illegal immigrant was charged with the murder of Iowa college student Mollie Tibbetts. (Image source: YouTube video screenshot.)

Shortly after finding the body of Mollie Tibbetts, the Iowa college student who had been missing for more than a month, authorities charged an illegal immigrant with her murder, according to Fox News.

Tibbetts went missing on July 18 after going on a jog. Cristhian Bahena Rivera has been charged with first-degree murder in her death. Police say Rivera led them to her body.

According to Fox News, they identified Rivera by way of surveillance footage that showed his car near the area Tibbetts took her jog and disappeared. Her body was found in a corn field, covered by corn stalks.

Rivera is now being held on a federal immigration detainer. Authorities believe the 24-year-old man had been living in rural Iowa for between four and seven years.

Rivera claims he blacked out during an altercation with Tibbetts, and then woke up at an intersection in Poweshiek County, realizing he had put her in the trunk of his car.

The suspect said he took her out of the trunk, saw blood on the side of her head, and dumped the body off in the corn field, according to court records.

An autopsy will be performed on the body to determine when and how Tibbetts died. Rivera is currently being held on $1 million bail.

The approximately 40 investigators that were working tirelessly to track Tibbetts down interviewed nearly 1,500 people in their investigation and received about 4,000 tips over the course of the 34 days between her disappearance and the discovery of her body.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/08/21/illegal-immigrant-charged-with-first-degree-murder-in-mollie-tibbetts-death,"['Strongly Republican', 'Republican', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Republican']","['5', '4', '4', '5', '5']"
39O6Z4JLX3F5O25YUN3YU9QH2WOVX7,Cynthia Nixon doesn't have much money left in her campaign,"Cynthia Nixon raised almost as much as Gov. Cuomo over the last month -- but she only has $441,000 left in her campaign account heading into the Sept. 13 Democratic primary, records show.

Cuomo, by comparison, has $24.46 million left -- a gargantuan financial advantage for the two-term incumbent.

Nixon raised $391,239 from July 13 to August 9, fueled by more than a thousand small donations.

""We are seeing a level of grass-roots momentum that Cuomo has failed to tap into during his entire two decade career in New York politics,"" said Nixon campaign manager Haley Prim.

Numerous bold-faced names popped up in Nixon's filing, including: ""The Closer"" actress Kyra Sedgwick ($10,000); Danny DeVito and his wife Rhea Pearlman ($5,000 each); ""Sex and the City"" co-star Kirstin Davis ($5,000) and actress Helen Hunt ($400).

Cuomo, one of the nation's most prodigious political fundraisers, collected $393,367 during the same period.

A Cuomo spokeswoman said that's because the governor has focused recently on raising money for other Democrats in races this year.

""With Trump and Republicans in Washington threatening New York's way of life - from health care and women's rights to immigration and tax reform - the governor is laser focused on taking back the U.S. House to protect the people of this state,"" said Cuomo campaign manager Maggie Moran.

Despite leading Nixon by 2-1 margins in public polls, Cuomo is spending big to ward off the insurgent, an eye-popping $7.4 million over the past month.

The lion's share went to TV ads touting his Excelsior Scholarship program and his positions opposing the NRA and President Trump.

Records filed with the Board of Elections Tuesday shows Cuomo spent about $5.5 million of the $7.5 million on TV ads.

His campaign also donated more than $400,000 to a variety of advocacy and constituent groups -- including $50,000 apiece to NOW New York City, Planned Parenthood, and the National Institute of Reproductive Health and $18,000 apiece to The Puerto Rican Family Institute and The Mohawk Valley Latino Association, among others.

The Nixon campaign spent less than a tenth of that -- $606,818.83 -- mostly on payroll, consultants and digital ads.",https://nypost.com/2018/08/14/cynthia-nixon-doesnt-have-much-money-left-in-her-campaign/,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['5', '1', '2', '1', '1']"
3YGYP13642R8J1ADJXBFVAAGFY5NRY,8 reality TV tragedies,"While reality TV keeps viewers entertained with often over-the-top and outrageous antics. But sometimes tragedy strikes and what was once entertainment turns serious.

Steve Irwin: ""Crocodile Hunter""

Although Irwinâ€™s nickname precedes him as the beloved personality who wrestled giant reptiles, his most important accomplishment is arguably instilling his spirited knowledge of wildlife to TV audiences across the globe.

The whole world let out a somber cry in September 2006 when he was fatally impaled in the heart by a stingrayâ€™s barb during the filming of an underwater documentary called â€œOceanâ€™s Deadliest.â€ He was 40-years-old.

The documentary was finally broadcast in January 2007 and dedicated to the memory of Irwin but made no mention of his death. The Australian conservationist is survived by his wife, who maintains his legacy alive owning and operating the Australia Zoo, and their two children.

Ryan Jenkins: ""Megan Wants a Millionaire""

The 2009 reality dating show following Megan Hauserman's search of a wealthy bachelor had only aired three episodes when it was suddenly canceled by VH1. The network axed the show because 32-year-old contestant Ryan Jenkins was sought in connection with the murder of 28-year-old swimsuit model Jasmine Fiore, whom he had married just days after wrapping up with the show.

The cancellation was just a precaution at the time because it was inconclusive whether Jenkins was directly involved in the murder. When police contacted Jenkins for questioning, he was on his way to his native Canada to deal with â€œimmigration issues."" By the time they found him in a remote hotel in British Columbia, he was hanging from a coat rack by a belt.

Although suicide isnâ€™t a confession, Jenkinsâ€™ activities around Fioreâ€™s death fill in the blanks sufficiently â€” surveillance cameras show he left their Vegas hotel with Fiore the night she died but returned alone, he moved thousands of dollars of his belongings out of his penthouse and into a storage unit and he made a phone call while on the road to his attorney who tried to get him to turn himself in.

In his house, police found dozens of unopened letters from Jenkins to Fiore, which showed jealousy and possessiveness.

Overall, it might have been less of an issue if Jenkins was eliminated in the early stages of â€œMillionaire,"" but the scary part was that he was a finalist.

Gia Allemand: ""The Bachelor""

Gia Allemand was a regular on â€œThe Bachelorâ€ franchise in 2010, placing third on that yearâ€™s season and competing in the debut season of the spinoff game show, â€œBachelor Pad.â€

Fans were saddened when the star was found dead of suicide in her New Orleans home in 2014. Some of her close friends said at the time that she was a troubled beauty wrestling with insecurities.

â€œI could tell there was some insecurity going. I donâ€™t know what she needed out of life. Itâ€™s sad,â€ said Reid Rosenthal, a contestant on Season 6 of â€œThe Bachelor.â€ Others said she had a magnetic personality.

""She was so full of life and love. She had that pull about her,â€ actor Jason London told Fox News in 2014. â€œShe was impossible to say no to.â€ The next season of â€œThe Bachelorâ€ kicked off with a tribute to Allemand, which included testimonials from cast members.

Diem Brown â€“ ""The Challenge""

Despite multiple bouts with cancer, Diem Brown always managed to be a familiar face on the reality game show series â€œThe Challenge.â€ Even before debuting on the show in 2006, Brown had one ovary and several lymph nodes removed due to cancer.

After six years in remission, her ovarian cancer returned. She controversially waited for treatment to preserve the eggs in her remaining ovary. â€œStoring eggs in a freezer makes me feel that if I leave this Earth, then at least a part of me will still be here,â€ Brown wrote in her blog for People.com.

She didnâ€™t hesitate to return to â€œThe Challengeâ€ after effective chemotherapy treatment put her cancer back in remission.

However, during her eighth season on the show, she collapsed on the set. Brown died three months later at 34-years-old due to complications from colon cancer. Brown founded a charity to help others battling diseases, which still operates today.

""Dropped""

In 2015, three French athletes were en route to a remote location in Argentina, where they would star in the new French reality survival series â€œDropped,â€ when their helicopters crashed in midair. Five people were aboard each aircraft and all 10 of them died as a result.

â€œThe brutal demise of our compatriots is an immense sadness,â€ said French President Francois Hollande in a statement. Among the athletes were Olympic medalists Camille Mufat and Alexis Vastine, and champion transatlantic sailor Florence Arthaud. The show was intended to be broadcast across Europe, but it was canceled in the wake of the accident.

Aiyana Jones: ""The First 48""

Although reality TV is presented as candid, it isnâ€™t unheard of for the stars to act differently because the cameras are rolling. Some believed this was the case in 2010 when 7-year-old Aiyana Jones was fatally shot during a routine SWAT raid while a film crew was taping for crime docuseries â€œThe First 48.â€

During a search for a homicide suspect, a police officer threw a flash grenade into Jonesâ€™ home. The lead police officer was confronted with â€œsome level of physical contactâ€ by Jonesâ€™ grandmother upon entering the duplex, which led to the officerâ€™s firearm discharging into Jonesâ€™ neck.

Jonesâ€™ grandmother denied any struggle with the officer and their attorney claimed it was a â€œcover-up.â€ Both sides turned to the tapes for answers but footage was only captured outside the home.

The officer was charged with involuntary manslaughter and reckless use of a gun but both cases were later dismissed.

â€œThe First 48â€ still came into question because the production team was accused of playing a role in the extreme procedures in place during the raid, particularly the use of flash grenades.

Shain Gandee: ""Buckwild""

â€œBuckwildâ€ had big shoes to fill when taking up the MTV time slot previously held by the â€œJersey Shore,â€ but the show was canceled after only one season because star Shain Gandee died.

The 21-year-old told friends he was going to drive offroad with his uncle and a friend after leaving a local bar at 3 a.m. Two days later, their lifeless bodies were found in a truck stuck in deep mud.

It was speculated that they chose to sleep there until the morning and kept the car running to stay warm, Gandeeâ€™s cousin told the Daily News. An autopsy confirmed they died of carbon monoxide poisoning

Although the filming of the showâ€™s second season commenced only a week before the mishap, no more episodes made. Hundreds attended Gandeeâ€™s funeral, which the production company of â€œBuckwildâ€ paid for as his family was unable to afford it.

Paula Goodspeed: ""American Idol""

â€œAmerican Idolâ€ contestants often call it a dream come true when they make it far on the singing competition show. Like the majority of contestants, Paula Goodspeed, a self-proclaimed pop star, had that very dream brutally squashed during her disastrous audition in 2006.

Judge Paula Abdul was politely vague saying, â€œIâ€™m speechless,â€ but Randy Jackson quickly translated that with his interpretation of the audition. â€œThat was terrible,â€ Jackson said.

Simon Cowell dropped the hammer by questioning whether someone could even sing with metal in her mouth in reference to her braces.

In the end, Goodspeed took the rejection hard, especially because she was infatuated with Abdul for years and modeled her appearance after her. Although Goodspeed said she would bounce back and continue singing, little could come from that promise because she died from an overdose two years later outside of Abdulâ€™s home.

Initial reports suggested that the harsh criticism sparked the downward spiral, but psychologists pointed out that she likely suffered from several serious mental health issues. It certainly didnâ€™t help that she was widely panned on the Internet.

A woman scaled onto the base of the Statue of Liberty on Wednesday, and is now in police custody along with seven others who were arrested during a protest at the landmark.

Liberty Island had to be evacuated while authorities spent two hours bringing down the protestor who climbed to the statue's foot and refused to descend on her own accord.

Anti-Trump group Rise and Resist hosted the demonstration, and its members displayed a banner reading ""Abolish ICE"" from Lady Liberty's pedestal. But protest organizer Martin Joseph Quinn told CNN that his group had nothing to do with the rogue member's ascension, saying while the protestor refused to come down:

""She climbed without our knowledge. It was not part of our action. We are deeply concerned for her safety.""

The protest took place along with numerous others around the US on Independence Day, challenging the Trump administration's zero tolerance policy while calling for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abrogated.

In Aurora, Colorado, roughly 100 demonstrators assembled outside an ICE detention facility, with protest organizer Corey Evans telling the press that ""it's kind of ironic that we are taking this day to celebrate freedom when we are enslaving people and holding them in these -- essentially -- concentration camps.""

Immigrant advocacy group Movimiento Cosecha Grand Rapids descended on the Michigan town's Fourth of July parade in another protest, calling the celebration inappropriate.

Member Jose Jimenez said, ""We cannot sit here in a parade or watch fireworks and celebrate freedom knowing that our families and children are being incarcerated at the border."" The group held signs reading ""We love immigrants,"" and ""No human being is illegal.""

But other political issues were also taken up by activist groups on Wednesday. In Atlanta, the NAACP met at southern monument Stone Mountain in hopes of having it destroyed, calling the Mount-Rushmore-type carvings of three Confederate figures ""the world's largest shrine to white supremacy.""

Fourth of July protests are becoming a trend in America. During a holiday meant to embrace the country's independence, various groups including numerous politicians and celebrities staged demonstrations in 2017 as well. Last year, singer Neil Young even released a resistance anthem.

The new holiday tradition appears to be gaining traction. On Tuesday, The New York Times published an opinion piece entitled, ""Forget the parades. Protest this Fourth of July.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/07/04/statue-of-liberty-evactuated-as-woman-scales-base-several-protestors-arrested,"['Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Neutral']","['1', '5', '2', '5', '4']"

The federal judge overseeing the reunification of more than 2,500 migrant families separated from their children praised the Trump administration on Friday for its work tracking down parents who had been deported.

U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw has at times lashed out at government attorneys when he felt they were moving too slowly to complete the reunifications he ordered on June 26. But with most reunifications now completed and both sides focusing on the 386 parents who were deported, Sabraw sounded thrilled.

""Both sides ... are really working collaboratively, which is absolutely essential,"" Sabraw said in his San Diego courtroom.

That's a big change from a week ago, when Justice lawyers argued that the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, should be responsible for tracking down hundreds of parents deported to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

Sabraw shot down that proposal, saying the government was ""100 percent"" responsible for finding the parents. He ordered the Trump administration to develop a comprehensive plan to do so.

On Thursday, the government submitted a six-page plan that designated administrators at the departments of Justice, State, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services responsible for overseeing efforts to find the deported parents. The plan outlines methods each department would use, and a system to coordinate with the government of each country to help locate the parents.

That process led to the government establishing contact with all but 26 of the 386 parents who had been deported. Sabraw repeatedly lauded the government for its progress.

""That would indicate to me that the government has put in an enormous amount of work in the last seven days,"" Sabraw said. ""Keep up the good work.""

Department of Justice attorney Scott Stewart said the remaining 26 parents could be more difficult to track down, but assured the judge that the government would keep trying.

""We continue and will continue those efforts in formulating, and now carrying out, the plan that we proposed,"" Stewart said.

Under an order from Sabraw, the ACLU also set up a committee of private law firms and non-governmental organizations that will follow up with each deported parent to make sure they understand their legal options. The collective will also help track down the remaining parents.

Friday's hearing marked the latest step following the decision by President Donald Trump to implement a ""zero tolerance"" immigration enforcement policy that resulted in the separation of more than 2,500 children from their parents.

The policy required that most people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally be charged with a criminal violation and sent to immigration detention centers or federal prisons to await deportation hearings. That prompted the government to keep them apart from their children, because a federal law and the 1997 Flores Settlement limit the detention of children to no more than 20 days.

Trump's policy was widely condemned, including by members of his own family, and the president signed an executive order June 20 ending the practice. A week later, Sabraw ruled that the practice may have violated the due process rights of the families and ordered the administration to reunite them within 30 days.

As of this week, the government has reunited 1,569 children with their parents at Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. Another 423 children were released from government custody because their parents agreed to place them with a sponsor living in the U.S., or because they turned 18.

Both sides are now focused on the 386 parents who were deported. The ACLU contends that parents should be allowed to return to the United States to make their case for asylum. The Justice Department has not agreed to that, saying parents will be given a choice: have their child sent to them in their home country, or waive their right to reunification to allow the child to fight for asylum in the United States.

3P7QK0GJ3U3LW67B7V78PP9HDT5Z22,"California Gov. Jerry Brown Sets Record of 1,018 Pardons in 8 Years","California Gov. Jerry Brown used his executive powers to issue 36 gubernatorial pardons on Friday, to hit a record of 1,018 pardons in eight years in office.

Although 22 of those were for murder and 13 for attempted murder or manslaughter, Brown said each of the pardons he provided went to individuals that had had â€œdemonstrated exemplary behaviorâ€ and lived â€œproductive and law-abiding livesâ€ following their convictions and time served in prison, according to the Fresno Bee.

Calmatters reported that by Brownâ€™s sixth year as governor in 2016, he had already forgiven 850 felons, more than California governors combined in the prior three decades. Combined with the 132 in 2017 and 36 so far this year, Brown has already issued 1,018 pardons. The governor is also expected to add to the total before leaving office, with his tradition of granting executive clemencies on Christmas Eve.

At least there of the governorâ€™s August pardons were for legal Cambodian refugees facing deportation for committing violent felonies. The Democrat governor moved in December to grant pardons to two other Cambodian men picked up in October immigration sweeps in Modesto and Davis, according to the Sacramento Bee.

The pardons have been described as acts of mercy to frustrate the Trump administrationâ€™s efforts to detain and deport immigrants with felony convictions that by law can result in the loss of legal residency status.

One of Fridayâ€™s pardons went to Vanna In, 43, who entered the United States legally at the age of 3 as a refugee of the Cambodian Khmer Rouge. Mr. In was sentenced on October 24, 1994 at the age of 17 for murdering a rival gang member in Fresno. He served six years in the California Youth Authority and was released in 2001, but lost his legal residency and was about to be deported for committing a violent offence, according to the Fresno Bee.

Gov. Brown supposedly learned of Mr. In through a change.org petition drive. After being released from the Youth Authority 17 years ago, Vanna In earned a masterâ€™s degree from Fresnoâ€™s Pacific Biblical Seminary and has worked as an ordained minister in vocational placement counseling with a local chapter of Hope Now For Youth.

Brown praised Vanna for living â€œ[a]n honest and upright life.â€ The pardon does not guarantee that Rev. In will recover his legal residency and avoid deportation, but the Bee reported it may help get an immigration judge overturn the order.

Brown also issued 31 commutations of sentence on Friday that will result in early releases from California prisons.

3LB1BGHFL3EFBFRJUOPLC5957CETYX,Convicted leaker Chelsea Manning to be barred from entering Australia,"Convicted leaker Chelsea Manning will be barred from entering Australia for a scheduled speaking tour set to start Sunday, her event organizer said Thursday.

The Australian government sent Manningâ€™s team a notice of intention to deny the convicted leaker's entry, said Think Inc. who is organizing the event. The organizers said they gave the government more than 10 letters of support from individuals and organizers who support Manningâ€™s visit to Australia.

""Ms. Manning offers formidable ideas and an insightful perspective which we are hoping to bring to the forefront of Australian dialogue,"" Think Inc. Director Suzi Jamil said in a statement.

All non-citizens visiting Australia must fall under the character requirements put out by the Migration Act. Anyone can be denied if they fail the character test.

Think Inc. is calling on her supporters to lobby new Immigration Minister David Coleman to allow her into the country, where sheâ€™s scheduled to speak at the Sydney Opera House and at two other events. While she can appeal, past precedent suggests the decision has already been made.

This isnâ€™t the first time Manning was denied entry to a country. Last year, she was barred from entering Canada, but was later allowed to appear at another event, Reuters reported.

After her trip to Australia, Manning is expected to travel to neighboring New Zealand. Immigration officials in New Zealand are expected to make a decision by Friday on whether to grant her a ""special direction"" visa.

She doesn't qualify for entry otherwise because she has a criminal conviction within the last 10 years for which she had a sentence exceeding 1 year, according to the country's visa rules.

Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison after she was found guilty of leaking military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks. She served seven years in prison before her sentence was commuted in 2017 by then-President Barack Obama.

The businessman had claimed Thursday that his application to join the party had been accepted after urging his supporters to follow so they could influence a future leadership contest.

But a spokesperson for the Conservative party told Sky News his application and that of Banksâ€™ spin-doctor Andy Wigmore had not been approved.

â€œOver 1.4m people follow Leave.EU online and we have urged them to join up and have their say,â€ he said.

Some Tory MPs, such as Antoinette Sandbach, spoke out against the move.

Meanwhile, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage is strongly opposed to Mr Bankâ€™s stance, writing on Twitter last Monday: â€œI would like to make something clear: I do not recommend joining Mrs Mayâ€™s Conservative Party.â€

He added: â€œThe Referendum Party and UKIP achieved a huge amount, none of which could have been achieved inside the Conservative Party. This issue is bigger than party politics.â€

3KL228NDMW4GM5GW69PN4EF5J8LGKE,"With governor's race, Georgia auditions as 2020 swing state","ATLANTA (AP) -- Move over, Ohio. Make room, Florida and Pennsylvania. Georgia wants in on the swing-state action.

The state's gubernatorial contest comes into greater focus Tuesday after Republicans choose between Brian Kemp, who is endorsed by President Donald Trump, and Casey Cagle, who is backed by the incumbent GOP governor. The victor in their party runoff will take on Democrat Stacey Abrams in her bid to become the first African-American woman elected governor in the U.S.

Abrams, a 44-year-old former state House leader, faces significant hurdles in a state that remains deeply conservative outside its metropolitan areas. No Democratic nominee for governor or U.S. Senate has carried the state since 1998. Bill Clinton was the last Democratic presidential candidate to win here -- in 1992.

Yet in the last decade, GOP standard-bearers have typically garnered no more than 53 percent of the vote. Some Republicans say that margin isn't enough as African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans and white transplants become a larger share of the electorate. The themes that will likely dominate the general election campaign for governor, including immigration and race, will help determine whether Democrats can become consistently competitive in the Deep South after years of stinging defeats.

""This is a light-red state,"" GOP pollster Mark Rountree said. ""I don't think Georgia will be a national afterthought for either side anymore"" regardless of what happens in November, Rountree adds.

A close loss for Democrats will still be a loss. ""There are no more moral victories in Georgia,"" says Democratic consultant Tharon Johnson. It's time for Democrats to capitalize on demographic changes and a ""talented candidate"" who should have plenty of campaign cash thanks to her national celebrity, he says.

Georgia's potential evolution toward swing-state status comes at a critical time for Democrats. Gains in coastal and Sunbelt states -- Virginia, North Carolina and potentially Arizona -- could offset growing challenges for the party in the upper Midwest, where Trump shocked many Democrats in 2016 by sweeping a band of states that Hillary Clinton's campaign had considered a ""blue wall.""

Ohio and Iowa are of particular concern for Democrats long-term, given that Trump's victory margin in both states neared double digits in 2016.

""These changes in states like Georgia aren't occurring in a vacuum,"" says Democratic pollster Zac McCrary. ""The party cannot afford to get in a situation where their only path to 270 (electoral votes) has to include Ohio, so we need to bring a state like Georgia online as a possibility.""

That reality and Abrams' candidacy have been enough to draw visits already from senators -- and potential Democratic presidential candidates -- Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who sought the Democratic nomination in 2016 and is considering a repeat bid, has also endorsed Abrams and told The Associated Press that he'd come to Georgia if Abrams asks.

Party interest spiked when Abrams won what initially was expected to be a competitive primary in May with 76 percent of the vote.

""I started getting a lot of calls then,"" recalls Johnson, the Democratic consultant. ""'Can she win?' Can she win?' they'd ask.""

The question is whether Republicans can continue to rely on a large share of the white vote outside Georgia's cities to ensure victory.

""Predicting the tipping point is impossible ... but if Stacey just tells people what she thinks, the votes are out there,"" says Democrat Jason Carter, who is former President Jimmy Carter's grandson and ran for governor in 2014, losing by eight percentage points.

Since Carter's loss, which he notes came in a midterm that was bad for Democrats nationally, Democrats have flipped several state legislative seats in the northern suburbs of Atlanta. In 2016, despite losing by five percentage points statewide, Clinton led Trump in the populous suburban Atlanta counties of Cobb and Gwinnett. No Democratic presidential nominee had done that since Jimmy Carter, himself a former Georgia governor, in 1976.

Abrams acknowledges she must piece together suburban swing voters, urban liberals, young voters and nonwhites from the cities and rural areas. But she insists the way to do it isn't by shying away from liberal policy positions -- something she says Georgia Democrats already tried in losing efforts.

So while she touts her deal-making with Republicans as a Democratic legislative leader, she unapologetically advocates expanding Medicaid insurance, enacting more stringent gun laws and spending more on education, job training and infrastructure. She criticizes Trump on immigration and other fronts, and she's expressed support for scrapping Confederate monuments around the state, including the depiction of Confederate leaders on Stone Mountain.

The state GOP and outside groups already have begun casting Abrams as an extremist, though most of her policy positions are not much different than Jason Carter's. But behind that rhetoric, even some Republicans say Abrams could be a bigger threat than previous nominees.

""You're going to get and give with Abrams,"" Rountree says, ""but their moderate, retread, old-ideas approach hasn't worked. ... They're being smarter this time.""

3PGQRAZX032EWFE45OKV20DJ5KSSYH,Hong Kong court upholds ruling in favor of same-sex couple,"Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal ruled Wednesday that the same-sex partner of a British expatriate is entitled to equal treatment under immigration law, marking a significant step for gay rights in the Chinese territory.

The unanimous judgment said the woman identified only as ""QT"" should be issued the same dependent visa that spouses and children of other foreigners working in the Asian financial hub are entitled to.

The ruling is seen as a landmark for Hong Kong, a Chinese territory and former British colony that maintains its own distinct Western-style legal system. Although same-sex unions aren't recognized under Hong Kong law, the city is broadly liberal in its social values and has a large foreign population.

""This judgment is a milestone for Hong Kong and a watershed moment for the rights of LGBTI people across Asia,"" said Jan Wetzel, senior legal adviser at Amnesty International, in an emailed statement. ""The government must now follow up and end the discrimination same-sex couples face in all walks of life.""

The ruling says the policy of accepting only opposite-sex spouses as eligible for a dependent visa ""constituted indirect discrimination.""

QT entered into a same-sex civil partnership in England with her partner, identified as ""SS,"" but was given only a visitor's visa when the couple entered Hong Kong in 2011. That did not permit her the right to work or study, despite SS meeting the financial and other requirements for sponsoring a dependent.

QT's application for a dependent visa was denied by a lower court but approved by the Court of Appeal. The immigration department appealed that ruling, arguing that Hong Kong law only recognized marriages between men and women, but Wednesday's judgment turned that down.

The Latest on immigration into Europe (all times local):

1:20 p.m.

Libya's coast guard says it has intercepted 40 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, near its shores, bound for Europe.

Coast guard spokesman Ayoub Gassim says a boat carrying 31 men, eight women and a child was stopped on Saturday off the coast of the western city of Zuwara. He said Sunday that the migrants â€” who are from Morocco, Egypt, Syria and Nigeria, were taken to a naval base in Tripoli.

Libya has emerged as a major transit point to Europe for people fleeing poverty and war in Africa and the Mideast, as human traffickers take advantage of the country's lawlessness.

Libyan authorities have stepped up efforts to stem the flow of migrants with the help of training and money from European nations. Aid workers, however, say migrants who are returned to Libya often risk facing beatings, rape or slavery.

He called on ""the international community to act decisively and quickly so similar tragedies aren't repeated"" and said the ""safety, respect of rights and the dignity of all must be guaranteed.""

36U4VBVNQPVLERUMGYN1952AN36RUK,The key moments in John McCain's life,"Image copyright Getty Images

Born on the eve of World War Two, John McCain came of age with the dawn of the US as a global superpower.

His lifetime spanned an arc across what Henry Luce once predicted would be the American Century - a time when US political, military and cultural power was unrivalled across the globe.

He fought in Vietnam and suffered the ravages of captivity as the US itself was wracked by doubt and anger over an inability to achieve victory in South-East Asia.

He became a rising star in US politics, only to nearly succumb to the temptations and corruptions of money and influence in American democracy.

He mounted an anti-establishment presidential campaign that presaged the anger and longing for authenticity that would later sweep through US politics.

He won the Republican presidential nomination as that fervour began to curdle, turning against him and the established order in his party.

In McCain's last days, he offered a full-throated defence of the idea that an internationalist, engaged American nation could serve as a guide to friends and a bulwark against foes - and railed against the man, Donald Trump, who campaigned against this world view.

McCain exits the stage at what is, perhaps, the twilight of the American century, when the nation has focused inward, concerned about potential dangers of immigration, the entanglements of multilateralism and the challenges of a global economy.

Here are six moments of McCain's life that reflect the American history he lived through.

Released from prisoner of war camp

14 March 1973

The image is striking. A gaunt McCain, aged 36, dressed in rumpled civilian clothes, marching along with fellow American prisoners of war to a US military transport plane that would take them to freedom.

More than five years of captivity in a Vietnam prison had aged him. McCain's hair had been dark when his jet was shot down by a surface-to-air missile during a mission over Hanoi. Now it was grey and white.

He walked with a limp - the product of injuries sustained from ejecting from his damaged plane, as well as torture at the hands of his Vietnamese captors. At a White House reception a month later with President Richard Nixon, McCain relied on crutches to walk.

He never fully recovered from his wounds. The limp would mostly disappear, but for the rest of his life he was unable to raise his arms above his head.

Political consultant Mark McKinnon, who advised McCain during his 2008 presidential run, describes helping brush the candidate's hair while they were waiting behind a van together before a public event in New Hampshire.

""It was just a vulnerable moment of this proud soldier,"" he said. ""And so I combed his hair, and he left to walk into the crowd. I turned away and just wept.""

Although McCain would remain in the military for eight years after his return to the US, the day of his release from Vietnam marked the pivotal moment of a military career that was seemingly ordained from birth.

Both his father and his grandfather were Navy admirals, the latter commanding a carrier group that fought against Japan in World War Two

McCain followed in their footsteps, attending the US Naval Academy, where friends said he sometimes struggled with the military tradition he was expected to follow.

""He felt like he didn't have a choice,"" says Frank Gamboa, one of McCain's roommates when the two men were midshipmen at the US Naval Academy. ""One of the burdens of having a family legacy is you can't be your own self.""

Throughout his time at the academy, McCain rebelled. He earned the nickname ""John Wayne"" McCain for his attitude and popularity with the opposite sex. He collected demerits the way some people collect stamps. He seemed perennially on the verge of failing out of school, and graduated near the bottom of his class.

McCain did occasionally use his family background as a shield. Gamboa describes one instance where McCain upbraided a senior classmate for being abusive to a Filipino steward during dinner - a bit of insubordination that could have landed him with a disciplinary report.

When the man asked for his name, McCain replied: ""John S McCain III. What's yours?"" Upon hearing the name, according to Gamboa, the man skulked off.

As a prisoner of war McCain had another opportunity to use his family name to avoid trouble - and declined. When his captors learned he was the son of an admiral, he was offered early release. McCain refused - insisting that those who were captured before him should go first.

""The interrogator told McCain things certainly are going to go very bad for you,"" Gamboa says. ""And that's when they started torturing him. It was a momentous and courageous decision to literally turn down freedom for the sake of his fellow POWs.""

McCain would spend years in solitary confinement, being tortured by the Vietnamese. He would eventually relent and sign a ""confession"" he had committed war crimes. He never sought or received special treatment because of his parentage, however, and when he left Vietnam he did so with his fellow prisoners.

Elected to Congress

2 November 1982

McCain made his entry into politics by winning an open seat in a reliably Republican Phoenix-area US congressional district. He had moved to Arizona shortly after marrying his second wife, Cindy, and spent some time working for her father, a wealthy Phoenix businessman, where he made the kind of influential connections that would help support his congressional bid.

""I was not at all surprised that he went into politics,"" Gamboa says. ""He had no more career left in the Navy. He wasn't going to get the assignments that he would need to make admiral, so remaining as a captain until retirement was not in his interests.""

The highlight of his first campaign was a Republican primary debate, when one of his opponents questioned McCain's ties to his newly adopted home state.

McCain, his temper flashing, shot back.

""Listen, pal, I spent 22 years in the Navy,"" he said. ""My grandfather was in the Navy. We in the military service tend to move a lot. We have to live in all parts of the country, all parts of the world. I wish I could have had the luxury, like you, of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of Arizona, but I was doing other things. As a matter of fact, when I think about it now, the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi.""

McCain would go on to win the primary by 6% over his nearest competitor. He would win more than double the votes of his Democratic opponent in the November general election.

In his 2002 memoir, McCain said that he thought his debate performance won the election - although it wasn't part of a grand campaign strategy.

""I was just mad and had taken a swing,"" he wrote.

McCain arrived as a freshman congressman in Washington with strong connections already in place. Prior to leaving the armed forces, he had served as Navy liaison to Congress and had forged ties with politicians and staffers in the Capitol. It was the same position McCain's father held when McCain was a teenager.

But McCain ""was always different,"" says biographer Elizabeth Drew. ""He was different in the prison camp and different in Congress.""

While his record in the House was fairly conventional, ""he was never just one of the boys,"" Drew says. ""There were pictures all over the place of this man, bedridden in a prison camp, so he always stood out from your run-of-the-mill politicians.""

McCain was elected president of his congressional class. On one of his first high-profile votes, he broke with his party and president, Ronald Reagan, in opposing a US military deployment to Lebanon - a position that would be vindicated just a month later, when 241 US Marines and 58 French soldiers were killed in a suicide attack on their military compound.

In his second term, he landed a plum position on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1985 he would return to Vietnam with legendary CBS television presenter Walter Cronkite, where he posed for photographs by a monument to the anti-aircraft battery that shot down his plane.

A US political magazine labelled him a ""Republican on the rise"".

A year later, he would run for, and win, a seat in the US Senate from Arizona. He replaced Barry Goldwater, the godfather of the US conservative movement and the Republican presidential nominee in 1964.

It was an office he held for the remaining 31 years of his life.

Cleared in corruption scandal

20 November 1991

One of the realities of American politics is that candidates and officeholders have to engage in a nearly endless effort to raise the funds necessary to run for office and win re-election.

It was a lesson McCain learned as he was courting Phoenix-area businessmen and wealthy donors prior to his first run for Congress. And it was one of those businessmen, banker and real-estate developer Charles Keating, who nearly destroyed McCain's political career.

The scandal that engulfed him grew out of the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s, when a combination of lax financial regulation and business corruption led to the collapse of more than a thousand financial institutions. Keating feared his firm, Lincoln Savings and Loan, was being targeted for increased scrutiny from government regulators and in danger of failing.

He urged his friends in the US Senate - men whose campaigns he had supported - to convince federal officials to go easy on Lincoln. One of those men was McCain, who in addition to taking campaign contributions from Keating, had gone on several vacations to the Bahamas courtesy of the businessman.

McCain sat in on two meetings between senators and regulators to review the matter. The five senators, simply by their presence, showed regulators that Keating had powerful friends. McCain said he only wanted to make sure Lincoln was being treated fairly.

In the second gathering, McCain learned that Lincoln was being referred to the justice department for criminal prosecution. At that point, the Arizona senator dropped the matter - but he had held his hand close to the flame. It wasn't long before the whole matter went public, and McCain felt the heat.

Lincoln collapsed, US taxpayers were out more than $2bn in deposit insurance payments, and Keating was indicted and convicted of fraud. McCain and the other four senators in the meetings became the face of corrupt political influence and the corrosive effects of campaign contributions.

They were given a nickname, the Keating Five, and the Senate Ethics Committee opened an investigation into the matter.

After originally bristling at the scrutiny - snapping at reporters who questioned his actions - McCain changed tactics, holding press conferences and openly admitting he acted improperly. In the end, the Senate investigation largely exonerated McCain, finding only that he had shown ""poor judgement"" in the matter.

McCain would later call the Keating scandal a ""hell of a mess"" and an ""asterisk"" that would haunt his political career.

""This stayed by his name,"" says Drew, ""and it bothered him a lot.""

The senator would go on to make campaign finance reform one of his central legislative goals. His work would eventually lead to passage of a landmark bill in 2002 that curtailed the influence of unregulated donations to political party committees as well as limited political speech by independent groups. The latter provision would eventually be struck down by the Supreme Court.

Brooke Buchanan, who worked on McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and later served as communications director in his Senate office, says fund-raising was the part of politics McCain found particularly distasteful.

""That was something throughout his career, his view of money in politics and the corrosive aspect of it,"" she says. ""He did not keep those opinions to himself.""

South Carolina defeat

19 February 2000

In 2000, George W Bush was the establishment pick for the Republican presidential nomination - back when that actually meant something.

McCain almost won anyway.

The Arizona senator ran a low-budget, media-friendly campaign best known for the candidate's free-wheeling style, as he toured New Hampshire - a key early primary state - on a bus nicknamed the ""Straight-Talk Express"".

He won the state by 18 points, a stunning victory that sent the Bush campaign scrambling and set up an electoral showdown two weeks later in the South Carolina primary.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption US Senator John McCain and his wife Cindy speak with reporters as they travel from Columbia to Sumter, South Carolina 07 Jan 2000

If McCain could post a win there, the veneer of inevitability that had insulated Bush would crumble, and ease McCain's path to the nomination. An earlier 50-point Bush national lead had vanished in the New England snow, and South Carolina was now a dead heat.

McKinnon, who worked on the Bush team in 2000, says McCain ""just kicked our butts in New Hampshire"".

It wasn't a mortal blow, however, and the Bush team made the decision to go negative on McCain and go hard. If their man was going to lose, he'd do it swinging.

On the record, Bush's supporters began criticising McCain's Senate voting record and attempting to undermine his reformer credentials. Their candidate adopted the slogan: ""A reformer with results"".

Off the record, things turned ugly. Rumours started spreading - fuelled by anonymously delivered pamphlets, emails and automated phone calls - that McCain had fathered an illegitimate, interracial child. (McCain and his wife had adopted a girl from Bangladesh, and her photograph was used in some of the material).

There were other elements of the whisper campaign - hushed questions about McCain's mental health, wild claims he was a ""Manchurian candidate"" programmed by his North Vietnamese captors, and rumours that he slept with prostitutes.

""It got really nasty,"" McKinnon says, admitting the Bush campaign knew there were third parties ""doing all sorts of crazy stuff"" but had no part in it. ""It would have been a crime if we had co-ordinated.""

McCain didn't help himself with South Carolina conservatives either, saying at one point that he believed the Confederate battle flag, which at the time flew over the state's capitol, was a ""symbol of racism and slavery"".

He later backed off that statement, calling the flag part of the South's ""heritage"", managing to disappoint both sides on a divisive topic.

He also criticised Bob Jones University, the South Carolina Christian college that prohibited interracial dating, where Bush had recently given a speech.

""McCain was not very good at cultivating evangelical support, and he thought they were intolerant,"" Drew says.

""He denounced them and their role in politics, which might have been correct, but it wasn't the political thing to do.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 'A reformer with results' appears on George W Bush campaign signs ahead of South Carolina's primary

When the Bush fusillade began, McCain's first response was to hit back. His campaign aired a television spot comparing Bush to then-President Bill Clinton - a move the then-Texas governor called ""as low a blow as you can give"". McCain would later order an end to his negative adverts after a woman at a town hall forum told him her son had become distraught after receiving a Bush campaign call that labelled the Arizona senator a liar and a cheat.

Bush ended up taking the South Carolina primary by 11 points. The Arizona senator would win a few more contests, but the well-financed and organised Bush machine regrouped and ground him down.

Those heady days after New Hampshire in 2000 were probably as close to the presidency as McCain came in his life. Bush, with a strong conservative tailwind, went on to defeat Al Gore later that year.

""If the campaign had ended in South Carolina a day or two earlier, McCain would have won,"" McKinnon says. ""And he would have won the presidency.""

McCain went back to the Senate and focused on passing campaign finance reform, biding his time until 2008, and making the kind of establishment connections to ensure his next bid for the presidency would begin from a position of strength.

Rejects Obama conspiracy theories

10 October 2008

By the time of McCain's trip to Lakeville, Minnesota, for the kind of town hall forum he'd been doing throughout the campaign, his 2008 presidential bid was in trouble. He was trailing in the polls, and the stock market was in freefall.

McCain's surprise pick for vice-president, little-known Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, was ""going rogue"" - lashing out at Democrats, questioning Obama's patriotism and accusing him of ""palling around with terrorists"".

She was giving voice to a Republican base growing increasingly unsettled and angry at the prospect of an Obama presidency after eight years of Republican rule. Some conservative talking heads and grassroots fringe groups were questioning Obama's citizenship, religious affiliation and eligibility to run for president.

It all came to a head at a high school gymnasium in Lakeville.

When one supporter said he was ""scared"" of an Obama presidency, McCain replied that the then-senator from Illinois was a decent person. The audience booed, as members of the crowd shouted that the Democratic nominee was a liar and a terrorist.

Then an older woman with frazzled white hair said she could not trust Obama, adding she had ""read about him"" and ""he's an Arab"". McCain shook his head and took the microphone back.

""No, ma'am,"" McCain said. ""He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign is all about.""

Brooke Buchanan, McCain's campaign press secretary, was standing by him at the Lakeland event and says she could tell it was a fiery atmosphere in the high school gym that day - and that McCain would probably pay a political price for his answer.

""We dealt with that the entire campaign because there is a Republican base who believed in that,"" Buchanan says. ""But at that point it didn't matter. It wasn't the right thing, and it wasn't the way that Senator McCain wanted to run his campaign.""

Over the course of the Obama presidency, the anger and resentment within portions of the Republican base that McCain had tried to confront in Minnesota grew more prominent. The party started to look more like Palin - a harbinger of Mr Trump's unvarnished conservative populism - and less like the Arizona senator.

""McCain was trying to carve out a new kind of Republican party, trying to move it to be a more centrist, forgiving kind of party,"" Drew says. ""He was leading a movement to do it. But in the end, there were forces bigger than them.""

'No' on Obamacare repeal

28 July 2017

It was the middle of the night when Brooke Buchanan's phone rang. It was McCain. She no longer worked for the senator, but the two still talked almost daily.

""Get up,"" he said. ""Turn on your TV. We're going to be making some news.""

The US Senate was considering whether to repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act, a comprehensive health-insurance regulation law that was Obama's signature legislative achievement.

The fate of the bill hung in the balance, as only one more ""no"" vote would kill the legislation and McCain was one of the few remaining undecideds. It was almost 1:30 in the morning.

As Buchanan watched on her television, McCain walked out on to the Senate floor and turned to the clerk tabulating votes. He held out his right arm - the one that hadn't been repeatedly broken in Vietnam - and gave a quick thumbs-down.

""No,"" McCain said quietly, then sat down at his desk in the Senate chamber, as Republicans gasped and Democrats erupted in cheers. McCain - who had flown back from Arizona for the vote after undergoing emergency surgery for his recently diagnosed brain tumour - had bucked his party's leadership one last time.

He had defied President Trump, the man who had stunned Washington when he questioned McCain's heroism as a prisoner of war.

""I just had a huge grin on my face,"" Buchanan says. ""I was proud of him for it. It was a tough decision to take, but again it was one of those times when the true McCain shined.""

Buchanan says McCain voted no, in part, to allow other Republican senators who had misgivings about the repeal legislation, including his friend Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, to vote in favour and avoid angering the pro-repeal Republican base.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption McCain on his way to the healthcare vote he would eventually kill

""He figured he had nothing to lose,"" she says.

It was McCain's most direct break with Mr Trump, but since then he stepped up his criticism. He denounced the president for striking a deferential tone with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki and the senator has condemned Mr Trump's attacks on the FBI and US intelligence services.

He also took swipes at him in a memoir released shortly before his death.

""The appearance of toughness, or a reality show facsimile of toughness, seems to matter more than any of our values,"" he wrote. ""Flattery secures his friendship, criticism his enmity.""

He also, according to the New York Times, told friends he did not want the president at his funeral - a final rebuke of the man who won the office McCain sought twice, but never achieved.

""I don't know if they've ever made them like McCain or they ever will,"" McKinnon says.

""He was great, but also vulnerable. He was not perfect, but he was the first one to admit that.

""He had low moments when he was a prisoner of war and low moments when he was in the Senate, but he never shied away from saying he was an imperfect human being, but at the end of the day it's my job to serve this country, and that's what he did.""

VIGIL HONORING MOLLIE TIBBETTS, MURDERED IOWA STUDENT, DRAWS HUNDREDS

Tibbettsâ€™ body was found by investigators on Tuesday in the Deep River area of Poweshiek County, covered in cornstalks.

Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, was charged with first-degree murder on Tuesday in Tibbettsâ€™ death. Heâ€™s being held on a $5 million cash-only bond. During his first court appearance Wednesday afternoon, Rivera looked stoic and refused to speak when given the chance. Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation special agent Rick Rahn said authorities believe this was a ""premeditated"" attack.

Tibbetts, a 20-year-old University of Iowa student, vanished on July 18 when she was jogging in her Brooklyn, Iowa neighborhood.

Police confirmed on Tuesday that Rivera was seen on surveillance footage driving back and forth in a Chevy Malibu in the area where Tibbetts was running.

While a source told Fox News on Wednesday that the vehicle was not registered to Rivera â€” sparking concerns others may have been involved â€” the Malibu was how investigators tracked down the man, who Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said has been in the U.S. illegally.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/23/autopsy-finds-iowa-student-killed-by-sharp-force-injuries.html,"['Republican', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['4', '4', '5', '5', '4']"
3XABXM4AJ2NN4T890GXW8NAGU4CQ8U,"Democrats calling for ICE to be abolished include Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren and others","Some Democrats have joined the call to abolish the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency â€“ especially under President Trumpâ€™s administration.

ICE was created through the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security in wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in 2001. According to its website, ICE â€œwas granted a unique combination of civil and criminal authorities to better protect national security and public safety in answer to the tragic events on 9/11.â€

Housed within DHS, ICE is in charge of executing hundreds of federal immigration statutes.

As more Democrats push back on the Trump administrationâ€™s immigration policies â€“ including the â€œzero-toleranceâ€ policy for illegal immigrants that resulted in thousands of children being separated from their families until the president signed an executive order â€“some are seemingly warming up to the idea that ICE should be eradicated or completely redone.

While some Democrats see calling on ICE to end could be a winning way to rally the partyâ€™s base in the 2020 presidential primaries, others have waffled on the idea or been unsupportive completely.

Trump suggested that Democrats who continue to push for abolishing ICE will â€œget beaten so badlyâ€ in the 2018 midterm elections in an interview with Fox News.

â€œYou know ICE, these are the guys that go in and take MS-13, and they take them out because theyâ€™re much tougher than MS-13, like by a factor of 10,â€ Trump said. â€œYou get rid of ICE, youâ€™re going to have a country that youâ€™re going to be afraid to walk out of your house.â€

From lawmakers to congressional candidates, read on for a look at some Democrats who have begun to call for the abolition of ICE.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, New York

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, seen as a potential 2020 contender, told CNN in late June that she believes ICE should be abolished. The New York Democrat said ICE has â€œbecome a deportation forceâ€ and said we â€œshould get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works.â€

Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont

In a series of tweets, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said â€œit is time to do what Americans overwhelmingly want: abolish the cruel, dysfunctional immigration system we have today and pass comprehensive immigration reform.â€

ICE and other agencies would need to be restructured, Sanders continued.

â€œCongress must do what the American people want. Let us create a humane and rational immigration system,â€ Sanders said.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts

Speaking at a rally in Boston on June 30, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., slammed Trumpâ€™s immigration policies, saying he â€œseems to think that the only way to have immigration rule is to rip parents from their family ... treat rape victims and refugees like terrorists and to put children in cages,â€ according to Real Clear Politics.

â€œThe presidentâ€™s deeply immoral actions have made it obvious we need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom, starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our morality and that works,â€ Warren said.

Rep. Earl Blumenauer, Oregon

While comparing ICE to broken phone app or computer program, Rep. Earl Blumenauer said of ICE to â€œshut it downâ€ in a June 24 blog post. He noted that he voted against the creation of the agency in 2002.

TOP DEMOCRATIC SENATOR BUCKS CALLS TO ABOLISH ICE: â€˜WE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO NEED IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENTâ€™

â€œWe should abolish ICE and start over, focusing on our priorities to protect our families and our borders in a humane and thoughtful fashion,â€ Blumenauer said. â€œNow is the time for immigration reform that ensures people are treated with compassion and respect. Not only because it is the moral thing to do, but itâ€™s better policy and will cost less.â€

â€œTo regain the trust of the American people, itâ€™s time we abolish ICE,â€ he added.

Rep. Adriano Espaillat, New York

Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., was one of three lawmakers who introduced legislation that would abolish the federal immigration agency.

â€œWe are pushing to bring an end to ICE as the agency has strayed too far from its original mission, intent and purpose,â€ Espaillat said in a statement. â€œIn the era of President Trump, ICE has been granted an unlimited range to terrorize Latino communities around the country, regardless of citizenship or status.

â€œWe are witnessing a human rights crisis, and our bill would bring forward a new model and dismantle ICE once and for all,â€ he said.

The Democrats who brought the bill forth â€“ which included Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and Pramila Jayapal of Washington â€“ ultimately said they would not vote for it, accusing House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, of creating a â€œpolitical stunt.â€

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, Washington

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., told Democracy Now she would â€œlove to see ICE go.â€

And in an interview with The Hill, Jayapal said she supports calls â€œto take a rogue agency and completely get rid of it and start over,â€ adding that â€œnobodyâ€™s saying, â€˜Donâ€™t have the functions that are necessary for the enforcement of immigration laws.â€™â€

â€œWe need to set up a commission that looks at the alternatives to ICE and really starts to understand how do we have these functions in a way that is accountable, transparent and humane,â€ she said.

Rep. Jim McGovern, Massachusetts

On his re-election campaign website, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., says â€œitâ€™s time to abolish ICE.â€

â€œWe need to start a fresh conversation. If there are elements that work, we can maintain and strengthen those aspects. Otherwise, we need to thoroughly re-evaluate and re-think immigration enforcement,â€ he said.

Rep. Mark Pocan, Wisconsin

Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., has done more than just call for eradicating ICE; heâ€™s written legislation that would do just that.

WHAT TRUMPâ€™S â€˜ZERO-TOLERANCEâ€™ IMMIGRATION POLICY MEANS FOR CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM FAMILIES AT BORDER

â€œUnfortunately, the president has created this situation where ICE isnâ€™t doing what it was created to do. Itâ€™s being used used as his own personal police force, and in those actions itâ€™s actually making us less safe because the critical functions of ICE can no longer happen when the president has them going after people in churches and workplaces,â€ Pocan told Fox News. â€œItâ€™s just been made a mess.â€

Rep. Nydia Velazquez, New York

Rep. Nydia Velazquez, who represents New Yorkâ€™s 7th congressional district, said getting rid of ICE would be â€œan important step.â€

â€œICE is being used to terrorize immigrant communities and carry out President Trumpâ€™s immoral â€˜zero-toleranceâ€™ policy,â€ Velazquez said in a statement. â€œMoreover, the agencyâ€™s almost myopic focus on harassing and targeting immigrants distracts from priorities most Americans actually share â€“ like cracking down on transnational criminals and sex traffickers.â€

â€œAt this point, modest reforms at the margins of the agency are insufficient. The time has come to abolish ICE,â€ she continued.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, echoed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez â€“ a young congressional candidate who stunned the political world when she beat longtime incumbent Rep. Joe Crawley in New Yorkâ€™s Democratic primary â€“ in calling for the eradication of ICE. He said while every nation needs a â€œsensible, transparent immigration regulationâ€ agency, ICE is not that for the U.S.

â€œICEâ€™s time has come and gone. It is broken,â€ de Blasio told WNYC in an interview. â€œICE has been sent on a very negative, divisive mission, and it cannot function the way it is. So I think that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is right. We should abolish ICE. We should create something better, something different.â€

Gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, Florida

Even before he became the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Florida, Andrew Gillum expressed his desire to abolish ICE.

Gillum, the progressive Tallahassee mayor, said he supports â€œa comprehensive immigration overhaul that includes abolishment of ICE in its current form to be replaced with a more compassionate and focused agency that actually keeps us safer,â€ the Orlando Sentinel reported.

â€œDonald Trump has turned ICE into a police and child separation agency â€“ not a border enforcement agency that treats people humanely and compassionately,â€ Gillum said. â€œA decision between security or compassionate immigration policy is a false choice; we can have them both, and I promise to fight for that as Governor.â€

Gillum faces Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis, who has been endorsed by Trump, in November.

Gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon, New York

Former â€œSex and the Cityâ€ star Cynthia Nixon, who is challenging New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, has called ICE a â€œterrorist organizationâ€ in calling for it to be dissolved.

â€œICE has strayed so far away from its mission. It is supposed to be here to keep Americans safe, but what has turned into, frankly, is a terrorist organization of its own that is terrorizing people who are coming into this country,â€ Nixon said during an event at a Manhattan church.

â€˜ABOLISH ICEâ€™ GOES MAINSTREAM AS GILLIBRAND, DE BLASIO BACK CALLS

Previously, she told â€œThe Viewâ€ that ICE should be abolished because it has â€œstrayed so far from the interests of the American people and the interests of humanity.â€ She said it wouldnâ€™t need to be replaced with anything else.

Already in the primary, Nixon has been credited with pushing Cuomo to the left on some issues. Cuomo has said he doesnâ€™t support abolishing ICE but did call them a ""bunch of thugs"" during a gubernatorial debate.

Congressional candidate Randy Bryce, Wisconsin

A Democrat running for outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryanâ€™s congressional seat in Wisconsin, Randy Bryce called for the abolishment of ICE.

Bryce accused ICE of having â€œgrown power hungry, sucking up more and more federal resources and directing them towards the deportation of children and families, who are otherwise completely law-abiding,â€ on his campaign website.

WOMAN ESCORTED DOWN AFTER SCALING STATUE OF LIBERTY FOLLOWING ANTI-ICE PROTESTS

â€œAccordingly, Randy believes that ICE should be abolished, and Congress should explore which existing agency could best house immigration and customs enforcement, so that only those who pose a true threat to our countryâ€™s security face deportation,â€ his website said.

Congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York

Abolishing ICE is part of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s platform as she runs for Congress in New York. Ocasio-Cortez, who is only 28, beat the incumbent Rep. Joseph Crowley in New Yorkâ€™s Democratic primary in June.

â€œAs overseen by the Trump administration, ICE operates with virtually no accountability, ripping apart families and holding our friends and neighbors indefinitely in inhumane detention centers scattered across the United States,â€ Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s campaign website states. â€œAlex believes that if we are to uphold civic justice, we must abolish ICE and see to it that our undocumented neighbors are treated with the dignity and respect owed to all people, regardless of citizenship status.â€

According to the liberal Mother Jones magazine, Ocasio-Cortez was one of the first congressional candidates in 2018 who called for the eradication of ICE.

3VIVIU06FLUP8KMUH92643KPNLKMIJ,WashPost: Trump Trims Obama's Legal Immigration Surge,"Increased oversight by President Donald Trumpâ€™s officials has trimmed the immigration spike created by former President Barack Obama during 2016 and 2017, according to the Washington Post.

According to the Washington Post:

The number of people receiving visas to move permanently to the United States is on pace to drop 12 percent in President Trumpâ€™s first two years in office, according to a Washington Post analysis of State Department data. â€¦ The shift in legal immigration is a reversal of the trend under President Barack Obama. During Obamaâ€™s time in office, immigrant visas increased by 33 percent, surging to 617,752 in fiscal 2016, the highest level in decades.

The Post noted that the legal immigration from Muslim countries is â€œon track to fall by nearly a third,â€ and it also cited criticism that the reduction â€œis really a Make America White Again agenda.â€

Administration officials told the Post that Trumpâ€™s policy is designed to help American workers and to upgrade security checks:

â€œIf youâ€™re empowering people to spend more time vetting an application, and youâ€™re not having a culture of getting to â€˜yesâ€™ but having a culture of make the right decision, itâ€™s axiomatic that you will not be able to process applications for immigration benefits at the same speed,â€ the official said.

But Trumpâ€™s deputies are still approving more immigrant visas than were approved during the first six years of Obamaâ€™s tenure, the Post notes.

The Post analysis only looks at about half the annual inflow into the United States.

The visa count examined by the Post only includes people arriving as family chain-migrants sponsored by prior immigrants, diversity visa-lottery arrivals, some foreign workers, and â€œspecial immigrants.â€ But many additional foreigners arrive in the United States via other methods and later â€œadjust statusâ€ from a visitor, temporary worker or even an illegal to become a legal resident.

The combination of both inflows ensured â€œapproximately 1.13 million aliens obtained Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, compared to 1.18 million in FY 2016,â€ according to the Department of Homeland Security.

That is a huge number. In comparison, roughly 4 million Americans turn 18 each year, so the federal government is importing roughly one new immigrant for every four new American adults.

After five years of legal residency in the United States, legal residents can apply for citizenship. According to the DHS:

A total of 703,000 aliens were naturalized in FY 2017, compared to 753,000 in FY 2016. Naturalizations increased from 106,000 aliens in the first quarter of FY 2017, to 159,000 in the second quarter, 207,000 in the third quarter, and 232,000 in the fourth quarter (see Table 3). The first and second quarter numbers were 32 percent and 11 percent lower, respectively, than the same quarters in FY 2016, while the third and fourth quarter naturalizations were 7.9 and 2.1 percent higher in FY 2017.

More data can be found here.

Trumpâ€™s immigration reform plan would further cut immigration levels by ending the inflow from diversity visas, some chain-migration categories and asylum requests. That agenda is being blocked by Democrats and some GOP legislators in Congress. But Trump has used his legal authority to curb illegal immigration over the Mexican border and sharply lowered the inflow of legal immigration via the refugee agencies. He has also blocked a business push in Congress for another amnesty of â€˜dreamersâ€™ and other illegals.

Pro-migration groups say the current inflow is too small and too slow. The expanded oversight in the Trump administration is a â€œsecond wall,â€ claimed a pro-migration advocacy group, the National Partnership for New Americans:

In just the last two years, a record setting 1,957,384 immigrants in the U.S. have applied to naturalize and become U.S. citizens. However, in the same period, the backlog of lawful permanent residents waiting for their citizenship applications to be processed increased from 367,009 to 734,209, a shocking 100.05% increase in the number of pending applications in two years. The exploding citizenship backlogs of the Trump administration have become a â€œSecond Wallâ€ that prevents lawful permanent residents from becoming voting U.S. citizens.

The group wants federal officials to approval all citizenship requests within six months, saying:

In response to the increasing backlog, NPNA and our partners in the Naturalize NOW Campaign are launching a national campaign, in conjunction with the release of this report update, to reduce the backlog and the waiting time for USCIS to process applications to six months, consistent with past practice, and to encourage naturalization for the millions of eligible [Lawful Permanent Residents].

Democrats want more immigrants because they expect the immigrants will vote for big-government progressive policies. Business groups â€” including those with close ties to the GOP â€” want more immigration because it helps investors by cutting wages, boosting consumption, and spiking real-estate prices. In practice, the federal governmentâ€™s immigration policy inflates the supply of labor â€” and so reduces the cost of labor â€” to help boost company sales and investorsâ€™ returns.

The Washington Post echoed those the business demands for more imported consumers and more wage-cutting workers:

Trumpâ€™s economic argument against immigration comes as the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent, the lowest level in nearly two decades. Some American businesses are clamoring for workers, and the slowing of legal immigration could further strain a job market in which a record 6.6 million positions are unfilled.

Trumpâ€™s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is nudging up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffettâ€™s railroad workers.

Four million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market â€” but the government provides green cards to roughly 1 million legal immigrants and temporary work-permits to roughly 3 million foreign workers.

The Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with foreign labor. That process spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. The policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kidsâ€™ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.

That cheap-labor economic strategy has stalled wage-growth since the 1960s:",https://www.breitbart.com/2018-elections/2018/07/02/washpost-trump-trims-obama-legal-immigration-surge/,"['Republican', 'Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Strongly Republican']","['5', '5', '5', '5', '4']"

The Oath Keepers group bailed on their plans to demonstrate outside U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters' field office, but that didn't keep her supporters from showing up and burning an American flag.

""You're not going to intimidate our queen, Maxine,"" the protesters can be heard chanting in the KCBS-TV video.

Dozens of Waters' supporters turned out Thursday afternoon to counter-protest against the Oath Keepers who had planned an armed demonstration outside the lawmaker's South Los Angeles office, KCBS reported.

The Oath Keepers had planned an armed demonstration to protest against the Waters who they called a ""terrorist inciter"" in a tweet, pointing to comments the liberal firebrand made at a rally last month.

The group notified police just before 2 p.m. that their protest was canceled. No one was injured or arrested at the demonstration.

The protesters, some armed with baseball bats and metal objects, claimed they were there to protect Waters and show their support for her.

""She is the queen of Los Angeles if you don't believe me ask anyone,"" one protester told KCBS.

One group, chanting ""black power,"" stopped a pickup truck as it approached the protesters, according to CBS News.

Some of the demonstrators opened the vehicle's door, which appeared to be occupied by two men, and grabbed the flag that was being flown on a pole in the truck's bed.

The men in the pickup sped off.

Protesters stomped on the flag and set it on fire, while someone else stoked the flames.

""This is not the American flag, this is their flag,"" some cheered.

""F*** the government, America was never great,"" others yelled, according to KCBS.

Waters has denied that she incited violence against Trump administration officials.

""If you see anybody in a cabinet from in a rest in a department store at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd, and you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome,"" Waters said last month during a toy drive.

After hearing that Oath Keepers had planned to protest outside her office Thursday, Waters shared a statement on Twitter that called for counter-protesters ""to not be baited into confronting"" the group ""with any demonstrations in opposition -- such an occurrence would only exacerbate tensions and increase the potential for violence.

""The Oath Keepers would like nothing more than to inflame racial tensions and create explosive conflict in our community... In order to ensure the peace and security of our community, it is best and preferable if no other demonstrations are scheduled.""

37SOB9Z0STFQCZMQWUU40K3B4PPL3Q,How President Trump Is Spurring Mayors to Speak Up on National Issues,"A bipartisan group of 16 mayors from across the country took a bus to the Mexican border last week to bring awareness to family separations taking place under the Trump Administration's zero-tolerance policy.

It was an unusual undertaking for a group of mayors, who are typically more concerned with potholes than national policy.

But experts say that Donald Trump's presidency is accelerating a trend that had begun even before he took office of local officials getting more involved in national issues. All politics is no longer just local, it seems.

""I think what you're seeing is the power of mayors coming together,"" said Miami Mayor Frances Suarez, a Republican who recently criticized the family separation policy in a letter to the editor in the Miami Herald. ""We as cities contain about 80 to 85% of the entire population of the U.S. in our cities. ... We can start having a bigger voice as a national group.""

It's not just the family separation policy. Local elected officials have also pushed back against Trump by declaring their areas ""sanctuary cities,"" where local police will not report potential immigration violations to the federal government; passing resolutions condemning Trump policies; and declining a traditional visit to the White House.

One reason for the trend is the increasing power that Democrats wield in bigger cities. Pushing back against an unpopular Republican president can win local support, which is especially crucial in areas where the races are essentially decided in party primaries.

""Many of the big cities are so Democratic that the real contest is among Democratic candidates,"" notes John Kincaid, a professor of at Lafayette and the director of the Meyner Center for the Study of State and Local Government.

For mayors who are looking to run for higher office, picking a fight with the president can also be a way to move onto bigger issues. In the current Congress, there are 43 former mayors -- 35 in the House and 8 in the Senate -- a total of about 8%.

Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, South Carolina, and an organizer of the border bus tour, said he's trying to reflect the thoughts of his constituents.

""My city is 43% African American and I'm a black mayor, but we have citizens from 200 different countries that speak 90 different languages,"" he said. ""We're a microcosm of a global society.""

Other mayors said they were moved to act by the seriousness of the family separation issue.

Mayor Keisha Bottoms of Atlanta, who signed an executive order that would bar Atlanta's city jail from accepting Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, noted that her seven-year-old daughter was reading a news article about family separations over her shoulder recently.

""She asked me 'What does sobbing mean?' because there was a story about children sobbing after being separated from their parents,"" she said.

Bottoms said that spurred her to do more.

""Watching the news over the past few weeks and watching these families separated in this very inhumane way really made me think about what it would be like when I look into the faces of my children and say what we did as a city,"" she said. ""I wanted to make sure that we weren't inadvertently complicit in this policy.""

Kincaid said this kind of mayoral activism has deep historical roots, noting that some local officials in the antebellum era avoided efforts to help authorities catch runaway slaves, while more recently city councils declared themselves nuclear-free zones or divested from South Africa during Apartheid.

Austin, Texas Mayor Steve Adler, who endorsed and helped to pass a resolution that requires police to inform individuals of their right to withhold their immigration status from officers, said it's just the nature of the job to try to do something.

""People expect their city government to actually solve problems, not to get lost in debates. They expect mayors to perform,"" he said. ""At the local level, when I go to the grocery store, I'm surrounded by my constituents telling me what they want to happen.""

Benjamin agreed. ""People in Washington like to talk a lot,"" he said. ""Mayors act.""",https://www.yahoo.com/news/president-trump-spurring-mayors-speak-194006478.html,"['Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Republican']","['4', '5', '5', '5', '4']"
39O6Z4JLX3F5O25YUN3YU9QH250XV3,Democrats Campaign to Raise Wages While Pushing Cheap Labor Immigration,"Nearly Half of Americans: Illegal Immigration Crushes Wageshttps://t.co/gWsx91Ow6Q â€” John Binder (@JxhnBinder) July 1, 2018

In a recent case of wage stagnation caused by illegal immigration chronicled by Breitbart News, American workers in the California construction industry had their wages cut in half after floods of illegal aliens inundated the state since the late 1990â€™s.

â€œThe reality is that a person that was hired as a laborer in 1988, I paid $15 an hour and within a month if I could leave him on the job alone, he got $20 an hour,â€ a whistleblower explained. â€œIf I hired somebody that already knew how to do certain types of labor or certain types of operations, they would get $20 an hour.â€

â€œNow, the average wage in Los Angeles for construction workers is less than $11 an hour,â€ the whistleblower said.

In widely cited research by the Center for Immigration Studies, researcher Steven Camarotta revealed that for every one percent increase in the immigrant population of a U.S. workersâ€™ occupation or field, the workersâ€™ weekly wage is reduced by about 0.5 percent. In a workforce where the immigrant population makes up about 10 percent of all workers, U.S. wages are reduced by five percent.

The Democratsâ€™ plan to abolish immigration enforcement would reverse the current tighter labor market that Trumpâ€™s â€œBuy American, Hire Americanâ€ agenda has delivered, likely spurring an immediate depression of wages.

Between 1973 and 2017, wages for American workers grew by only ten percent. This means that wages grew by only 0.2% every year over the past more than four decades.

Meanwhile, since 2005, the U.S. has continued to bring in more than a million mostly low-skilled foreign nationals every year. Over the last decade, the U.S. imported more than ten million foreign nationals to the country, exceeding the population of New York City.

3LVTFB9DE602X8ERJE9K00REIEDGQ6,Jumaane Williams found guilty of obstructing ambulance,"City Councilman Jumaane Williams was convicted Monday of blocking an ambulance to protest the deportation of his friend -- but was found not guilty of obstructing police efforts to move him out of the street.

The lieutenant governor candidate and dozens of other protesters stood in front of the FDNY vehicle, which was trying to take immigrant-rights activist Ravi Ragbir to the hospital.

Ragbir fainted Jan. 11 during a check-in with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who had just ordered his immediate deportation.

Although Williams faced up to a year in jail, Judge Steven Statsinger sentenced him to time served, which amounted to a few hours he had spent in custody.

""I believed and I still believe, sir, your heart was in the right place,"" the judge told Williams shortly after the jurors reached their verdict in Manhattan Criminal Court. ""Your moral compass, which is otherwise, as far as I can tell completely accurate, just went a little awry.""

It took the panel of six jurors about two hours to find Williams, 41, guilty of obstructing emergency medical services and to acquit him of obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct.

Jury foreman Eric Declercq said that Williams wasn't justified in impeding the ambulance.

""We felt Mr. Williams was a good guy,"" Declercq said. ""But he can't stand in front of an ambulance. No one has that right.""

The ambulance, which defense lawyers Ron Kuby and Rhiya Trivedi referred to as a deportation vehicle, was called at Ragbir's request.

The panel said that the not guilty verdict partly stemmed from concerns over the police's role in the deportation.

Juror number 5, Adam Swire, said the EMS response appeared to be by the book, while the police response raised ""a real question as to whether city resources were being used to enforce a federal immigration action.""

Williams, who is running for lieutenant governor, was the only protester to press for trial. The 17 others took dismissal deals.

On the stand, Williams said he felt morally compelled to stop an illegal deportation. On cross-examination by prosecutor Ryan Hayward, Williams conceded that he didn't know at the time whether there was a medical emergency.

Ragbir, who is from Trinidad, was convicted of wire fraud in 2000, prompting the deportation order, which he has been fighting for more than a decade.",https://nypost.com/2018/08/06/jumaane-williams-found-guilty-of-obstructing-ambulance/,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['5', '5', '4', '4', '5']"
3GV1I4SEOA7P9I98FWS27NFVEGRL6W,Immigrants drop out of nutrition programs over citizenship fears,"Legal and illegal immigrants alike are turning down government help to buy infant formula and healthy food for their kids because they fear that Team Trump could ban them from ever getting a green card if they get aid, a report said Monday.

President Trump recently proposed denying citizenship or even green cards to any immigrants who accepted federal benefits, including welfare, children's health insurance, Obamacare and the Women, Infants and Children federal nutrition program.

And local health providers and advocates across the US, including in the Big Apple, say they're getting calls from panicked immigrant families demanding that they be dropped from the WIC program, Politico reported.

Zach Hennessey, vice president of programs at Public Health Solutions, a large health non-profit in New York City, said his agency was struggling to deal with immigrants.

They want eligible people to be able to get benefits, but if they advise them to do so they may end up hurting them in the long run.

""Without a draft rule being released, we don't think it's wise to frighten people or tell them that they're in the clear,"" he told the website.

Trump's plan is the brainchild of senior adviser Stephen Miller, the 32-year-old immigration hardliner who was also one of the principal architects of the president's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy at the southern border.

That policy led to the forced separation of more than 2,500 children from their parents, part of the administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.

The administration would implement the policy by executive order, which means it would not require Congressional approval.

It's one part of Miller's goal of slashing the number of legal immigrants entering the US each year.

Immigration lawyers and advocates said it would be the biggest change to the legal immigration system in decades, and estimate that more than 20 million immigrants could be affected.

Agencies in at least 18 states told the website that enrollment has dropped up to 20 percent because people fear losing their eventual path to citizenship.

Advocates say the policy change could also put babies who are US-born citizens at risk of problems including low birth weight that might eventually lead to increased health care costs.

Called the #EveryFamilyIsHoly campaign by Christ Church Cathedral, statues of the Holy Family are in front of the church in an â€œICE detentionâ€ chain link cage to â€œbring awareness to the humanitarian atrocities from our nationâ€™s â€˜zero-toleranceâ€™ immigration policies on the border and here in Indianapolis.â€

The display was set up weeks after thousands of minors were separated from their families at the border. After national outrage from both sides, Trump signed an executive order in late June allowing families to remain together in detention.

Stephen Carlsen, dean and rector of Christ Church Cathedral, told Fox News the demonstration will remain outside the downtown Indianapolis church however long it's needed.

â€œHoly Scripture is clear about how we are to treat people trying to find safety for their families â€“ we are to show mercy and welcome them,â€ Carlsen said in a statement.

â€œThe Holy Family today calls us to stand with all families seeking safety and a future for their children,â€ he continued. â€œWe will not stand by while children are being taken from their parents, and families are being taken from our communities and congregations.â€

WHAT TRUMPâ€™S â€˜ZERO-TOLERANCEâ€™ IMMIGRATION POLICY MEANT FOR CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM FAMILIES AT BORDER

Carlsen said the church puts out a crÃ¨che â€“ the Nativity scene that often includes the Holy family, shepherds, the star of Bethlehem and angels â€“ every year around Christmas as a â€œsymbol of a homeless family with nowhere to go and where Christ was born.â€ That display, he said, â€œchallenges us on how we treat the most vulnerable peopleâ€ â€“ which he hopes the new display will do, too.

She went missing on July 18 while jogging in her hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa. USA TODAY

The arrest of a reported undocumented immigrant in the murder of a 20-year-old Iowa college student has reignited a debate over the dangers â€” real and perceived â€” posed by illegal immigration.

During a Wednesday morning discussion about the case on Fox &amp; Friends, a favorite of President Donald Trump, commentator Tomi Lahren summed up what many conservatives have been arguing since government officials reported that the man charged with killing Mollie Tibbetts had entered the country illegally from his native Mexico. On Wednesday, the suspect's attorney filed court documents declaring his client is here legally, reported the Des Moines Register.

""Illegal immigration kills Americans,"" Lahren said. ""It's Mollie Tibbetts (today), and it could be your daughter, your sister, your friend tomorrow.""

Missing from that discussion was any proof that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes or acts of terrorism than native-born Americans. Immigration experts, including academic researchers, have said that's because all available national crime statistics show immigrants commit fewer crimes, not more, than those born in the U.S. Even opponents of increased immigration lack evidence linking immigrants to higher crime rates.

""There's 100 years of data from all different sources that all point in the same direction,"" said Walter Ewing, senior researcher at the American Immigration Council, which advocates on behalf of immigrants. ""If you don't believe one study, there's 10 more behind it that say the same thing.""

Ewing and others acknowledge that assessing the criminality of immigrants has always been difficult because statistics are hard to come by. Local police do not list the immigration status of those arrested, meaning it's impossible to determine exactly how many crimes are committed by legal immigrants, undocumented immigrants and native-born citizens.

Immigration researchers have spent decades trying to work around the problem.

One method uses prison data to determine the immigration status of convicted criminals. Those who are foreign-born make up more than 13 percent of the U.S. population, but the Department of Justice released a report in January that found only 5.6 percent of inmates in federal, state and local prisons are foreign-born.

More: Cristhian Rivera, charged in Mollie Tibbetts' death, worked at Iowa GOP family farm

The libertarian Cato Institute used similar data when it concluded that the incarceration rate for native-born Americans is 1.53 percent compared to 0.85 percent for undocumented immigrants and 0.47% for legal immigrants. When Cato subtracted people in prison solely for immigration violations, the incarceration rate for undocumented immigrants fell to 0.5 percent.

Ewing used another approach to look at national immigration trends. From 1990 to 2013, both legal and undocumented immigrants came pouring into the U.S. The percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born increased from 7.1 percent to 13.1 percent. Yet over that time, violent crime rates plummeted 48 percent across the country.

In 2014, a team of university professors took a different approach. They examined crime habits of juveniles convicted of felonies in Arizona and Pennsylvania. Their study found that native-born juveniles were more likely to become repeat offenders than immigrant juveniles.

Department of Homeland Security statistics offer another way to look at the question. Nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children have received deportation protections under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which Trump is in the process of ending.

DACA enrollees are required to maintain a clean criminal record to remain in the program. In the six years since the program started, only 2,127 DACA enrollees (0.27 percent) have been removed from the program after committing crimes or being identified as gang members, according to data from Homeland Security.

Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that has advised the White House on ways to limit legal and illegal immigration, said each of those approaches contains significant flaws. For example, she said the number of immigrants in U.S. jails and prisons may be low because some criminal immigrants get deported and others are released into the community by sanctuary cities.

Vaughan's team has researched the question of immigrant criminality for years and concluded it's impossible to determine whether immigrants commit crimes at a higher rate than the native-born. Vaughan said the answer doesn't even matter.

""Kate Steinle's parents I'm sure don't care one bit whether the crime rate in San Francisco is higher or lower than anywhere else,"" she said, referring to the 32-year-old who was shot and killed by an undocumented immigrant in 2015. ""The issue is not crime rates. The issue is what we do with that small fraction of immigrants that is committing crimes and causing problems.""

Trump repeatedly mentioned Steinle's death on the campaign trail. And during his State of the Union Address in January, he introduced the parents of two teen girls killed by undocumented immigrants allegedly belonging to the MS-13 gang, an international gang formed in Los Angeles and mostly made up of Salvadoran immigrants.

Moira O'Neil, who studies the public perception of immigration for the FrameWorks Institute in Washington, D.C., noticed how Trump used the age-old tactic of repetition during that speech to drive home his point. He mentioned the MS-13 gang four times, and said the word gang five times.

""It's very effective,"" said O'Neil. ""People are hearing that over and over and over again.""

O'Neil said immigration advocates have not been able to match the Trump administration's rhetoric when framing the immigration debate. She said Trump has been hammering the notion that immigrants are criminals, while Democrats and other immigration supporters have been unable to keep up.

As a result, she said the public may associate immigrants with crime, leading to a stereotype that sticks.

""Think about it like exercising,"" O'Neil said. ""Every time he says MS-13, that association between immigrants and criminality is being activated in their minds. The way to counter that is to remind people of a very positive vision that lots of people have about immigrants. They are us. They are human beings.""

3IV1AEQ4DSV6I64W5QDNBMYUG08J82,Migrant crisis: EU leaders split over new migrant deal,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why is the Aquarius migrant rescue ship empty?

EU leaders have differed sharply over how a new deal on curbing irregular migration will work.

The agreement foresees the creation of secure centres to receive migrants.

France's president said his country would not set any up as it was not the EU country where migrants landed first.

Italy's prime minister - who had held up agreement at the Brussels summit - said centres could be anywhere within the EU. EU President Donald Tusk warned of difficulties to implement the deal.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of a ""significant step forward"" but said more must be done to resolve disagreements.

A common policy at last?

By Katya Adler, Europe Editor, BBC News, in Brussels

So has Europe's migrant crisis now been solved? In a word, no. On two fronts. Firstly, that of preventing illegal migration and saving migrant lives.

Take for example the processing centres that are to operate inside and outside the EU. The idea behind those is to put economic migrants off coming to Europe as they'll know only those with a legal right to asylum or refugee status can stay. But these processing centres are voluntary. We don't know where or when (or if) they will be operational - and in the meantime, migrants will keep making that perilous journey across the Mediterranean.

The second failure is more of a half-failure, and it's a political one. Let's face it - with the sharp drop in arrivals to Europe, the stresses and strains between EU countries are clearly political. The fact that leaders like Germany's Angela Merkel leave this summit claiming that ""a significant step forward has been taken"" is a hint that, in true EU summit style, leaders have papered over the cracks.

But is Europe North, South, East and West united now over a common migrant and asylum policy moving forward? Absolutely not.

Who gets what from the deal?

The deal is being billed as a lifeline for Mrs Merkel, who has faced a political crisis at home where a key ally, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, has threatened to start turning away migrants who have already registered elsewhere.

Italy also differed with Spain and Greece who agreed to take back migrants registered on their territory who had travelled on to Germany.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had earlier taken the rare step of blocking the conclusions of the summit's joint communique until the leaders had settled the migration issue.

The 28 EU leaders agreed several other measures, including:

Strengthening external border controls, with more funding for Turkey and countries in North Africa

Exploring the possibility of ""regional disembarkation platforms"", designed to thwart people-smuggling gangs by processing migrants outside the EU

Boosting investment in Africa to help the continent achieve a ""socio-economic transformation"" so people no longer want to leave in pursuit of a better life in Europe

Where would the secure centres be built?

The centres are meant be set up by EU states on a voluntary basis, but there are no details on which nations might host them or take in refugees.

French President Emmanuel Macron said they would be in countries where migrants initially arrived in the EU, and that France would not have any as it is ""not a country of first arrival"".

But Mr Conte told reporters that all EU states would be able to establish the centres, ""including France"". He suggested Mr Macron had been ""tired"" when he spoke.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte took issue with France's President Macron over the specifics of the deal

About 56,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, the International Organization for Migration says, compared to more than a million in 2015.

Several Central European states have so far rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy.

How have aid agencies responded?

John Kasich and President Donald Trump. (Image source: Columbus Dispatch video screenshot)

As President Donald Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich continue to publicly feud, Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike DeWine is carefully avoiding that conflict and focusing on issues important to Ohio voters, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer.

Trump partially blamed Kasich for Republican Troy Balderson's congressional race victory being so tight, even with an endorsement from the president.

Both Trump and Kasich are highly popular in Ohio, so DeWine has to court both of their supporters without alienating large portions of the GOP voter base.

""It's really not even so much about personalities in the sense of who endorses who,"" DeWine told the Enquirer. ""But ultimately, the voter needs to walk into the booth and make his or her own decision, and we're talking directly to those voters.""

Trump and Kasich differ sharply on healthcare. Kasich was and continues to be an ardent supporter of Medicaid expansion, while Trump has been trying to dismantle Obamacare since day one of his presidency.

DeWine, who could only get Kasich's support by saying he would continue Medicaid expansion if elected, has taken a middle ground of promising to continue Medicaid expansion but also to manage the costs by implementing work requirements.

""He came out for Medicaid expansion,"" Kasich said. ""I had a very direct conversation with him and he came out for it, so yeah, I'm going to be supporting Mike.""

As for Trump's stance on inflammatory issues like immigration policy and border security, DeWine has little incentive to get involved -- Ohio voters have somewhat different priorities than the nation as a whole.

""Mike DeWine has his own outlook for Ohio,"" said GOP strategist Mark Weaver. ""It doesn't really involve talking about what the president is talking about right now.""

Trump hasn't spoken much about DeWine, nor DeWine about Trump, but the president did acknowledge DeWine positively while campaigning for Balderson, calling the Ohio attorney general ""terrific.""

DeWine initially supported Kasich in the 2016 Republican primary, but eventually put his support behind Trump because he did not want Hillary Clinton to win the presidency.

The most recent poll available on the Ohio governor's race, a Marist College poll from June 22, shows DeWine leading Democratic candidate Richard Cordray 46 percent to 42.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/08/14/oh-gov-gop-candidate-dewine-avoids-trump-kasich-conflict-has-his-own-outlook-for-ohio,"['Neutral', 'Republican', 'Democratic', 'Republican', 'Republican']","['2', '1', '2', '3', '1']"

Developing now, Friday, August 24, 2018

The Trump Organization and two senior company officials may face criminal charges stemming from the hush money former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, according to a report

A war of words between President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions broke out over a FOX News interview where Trump slammed Sessions for never taking 'control' of his Justice Department; Sessions has vowed the DOJ would not be influenced by politics

The attorney for Mollie Tibbetts' accused killer dismissed claims that his client is an illegal immigrant as 'rhetoric'

THE LEAD STORY - CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR TRUMP ORGANIZATION? - The Manhattan district attorneyâ€™s office in New York City may push for criminal charges against the Trump Organization and two senior officials at the company over hush money that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen paid to an adult-film actress, according to a report ... Investigators led by District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. would look at how the company accounted for its reimbursement to Cohen for the $130,000 he paid to Stormy Daniels, who claims to have had an affair with President Trump, the New York Times reported. Two officials with knowledge of the matter told the Times that the possible action was still in its early stages and no decision has been made on whether the state investigators will go after the Trump Organization.

TRUMP VS. SESSIONS: Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired back Thursday at President Trump for saying he â€œnever took control of the Justice Department,â€ putting out a sharp statement vowing the agency wonâ€™t be â€œimproperly influencedâ€ by politics ... Trump had made the comments in a wide-ranging interview with â€œFOX &amp; Friends.â€ The president, on the heels of the conviction of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, continued to fume over Sessions' recusal from the Russia investigation. Sessions countered in a written statement, saying, in part: â€œWhile I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.â€

The president for months has railed against Sessions over his recusal, but the attorney general has hung on, occasionally pushing back publicly. The president discussed Sessions when asked in the Fox News interview if he would fire his AG and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after the midterms. He didnâ€™t rule it out, but said he wanted to stay â€œuninvolved.â€

The latest public spat between Trump and Sessions came as New York's attorney general is reportedly looking to open a criminal investigation into whether Michael Cohen violated state tax law. The Associated Press reported that New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood recently requested a criminal referral from the state tax department to investigate and potentially file charges against Cohen, the former personal attorney for Trump.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT 'RHETORIC': The attorney of Mollie Tibbetts' suspected killer fought back Thursday night against investigators' statements that his client, Cristhian Rivera, is an illegal immigrant, calling it ""rhetoric"" ... ""That's your rhetoric on it,"" attorney Allan Richards told Fox News' Martha MacCallum on ""The Story."" Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said Wednesday that Rivera, 24, has been in the U.S. illegally, and lived in Iowa for four to seven years. MacCallum argued that his immigration status is ""just a fact,"" but Richards pushed back â€” continuing to refer to it as the anchor's ""point of view."" ""You want to jump to say theyâ€™re facts,"" Richards said. ""Have these people been under oath? Have these people provided the opportunity to Cristhian to present his point of view on the matter?""

'PURE POLITICS': U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., told FOX News on Thursday night that charges filed against him and his wife, Margaret, were â€œpure politicsâ€ and that he never used campaign funds for personal spending ... Hunter and his wife were indicted on charges of illegally converting $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses and filing false records. They pleaded not guilty on Thursday. Speaking to FOX Newsâ€™ Martha MacCallum exclusively on â€œThe Story,â€ Hunter said many of the trips in question â€œwere fundraisers.â€ Still, he conceded, â€œMy campaign did make mistakes. There was money spent on things, not by me but by the campaign, and I paid that back before my last election. I paid back $60,000 after I did an objective audit. This is pure politics.â€

Rep. Duncan Hunter's opponent: Hunter lost his way in DC

PARADISE IN PERIL: As Hurricane Lane battered and drenched parts of Hawaii, emergency crews rescued five California tourists from a home they were renting in Hilo ... In an interview with the Associated Press, tourist Suzanne Demerais said a tiny waterfall and small stream flowed near the home when she first arrived with four of her friends from the Los Angeles area. But the stream turned into a torrent and the river rose rapidly over 24 hours. Hawaii County firefighters, who were in touch with the home's owner, decided to evacuate the group before the water rose further. They floated the five out on their backs, Demerais said.

""It was quite an experience because we weren't planning to have a hurricane during our vacation time,"" Demerais said. Hurricane Lane, which was still offshore, has lashed the Big Island with nearly 20 inches of rain in about 24 hours. It was packing maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, making it a Category 3 hurricane. Forecasters say it will move close to or over portions of Hawaii's main islands on Friday, bringing dangerous surf of 20 feet.

3IJ95K7NDYUHUB1Z3MH3W6W9D3QGNJ,US border agents halt migrant family prosecutions,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The cost of detention v the alternatives

A US border security chief says he has temporarily stopped launching criminal prosecutions of migrants who illegally enter the country with children.

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told reporters in Texas the prosecution referrals were suspended last week.

He said it followed an order last week by President Donald Trump calling for an end to migrant family separations.

But Mr Trump had suggested the families would instead be detained together.

The Republican president bowed to public pressure last Wednesday, signing his executive order to ""keep families together"" in migrant detentions.

Mr McAleenan maintained that the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" tactics were still in effect, although the commissioner's guidance to his agents largely leaves the policy in limbo.

What does this mean for families?

The CBP chief said parents cannot be prosecuted if US officials no longer intend to separate them from their children, who are legally not allowed to be kept in adult detention facilities.

He said his agency and the Department of Justice must figure out how to prosecute the parents without splitting them from their children, the Associated Press news agency reported.

The border official's decision paves the way for US immigration enforcement to revert largely to the approach under the Obama administration.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Drone footage shows a ""tent city"" immigration centre

It means US border agents who stop undocumented adult migrants accompanied by children will hand them a court summons and allow them to go on their way, rather than hold them in a detention facility. Adults unaccompanied by children will still be detained.

Mr Trump repeatedly lamented this ""catch and release"" policy before his administration began in April criminally prosecuting adult migrants and holding their children separately to deter border crossings.

On Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the reality was that the US did not have the space to hold all the undocumented families coming across the US-Mexico border.

""We're not changing the policy,"" she told reporters. ""We're simply out of resources.""

What is the Trump administration proposing?

Mr Trump earlier said that the US needed ""a nice simple system that works"".

""We want a system where, when people come in illegally, they have to go out,"" he said.

The Pentagon confirmed on Monday that two Texas military bases will be used as temporary camps to house the immigrants.

But Defence Secretary Jim Mattis did not specify whether the facilities - Fort Bliss and Goodfellow Air Force Base - would house migrant families together.

US media earlier reported that one of the bases would be used to house migrant families and the other would shelter undocumented children who enter the US unaccompanied by an adult.

Meanwhile, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions talked tough on immigration at a school police officers' conference in Reno, Nevada, on Monday.

America's top law official said that refusing to prosecute adults who illegally enter the US ""would be a disservice to the people of this country"", reports the New York Times.

He told the audience that lax border enforcement would ""encourage more adults to bring more children illegally"".

However, he also said the Trump administration would ""do everything in our power to avoid separating families"".

What's the latest on families already divided?

The government has yet to reunite parents with more than 2,000 children who have been taken away since last month and sent to holding cells, converted warehouses, desert tents or foster care around the US.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sought a federal court injunction in San Diego, California, on Monday to stop the administration from separating undocumented immigrant parents from their children.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump signed an executive order halting separations but thousands of children remain separated from their families

It said that Mr Trump's order to end separations contained ""loopholes"".

Court papers filed by the ACLU contained numerous accounts of parents unable to locate or communicate with their children after they were separated by border officials.

In one declaration filed with the brief, a mother identified only by her initials E.J.O.E. said the government told her she would be reunited with her son as she applied for asylum.

But she says she was deported without her eight-year-old boy.

More than 20 separated children are at a US government tent camp in Tornillo, Texas.

At least 40 such men and women were abruptly shown the door by Uncle Sam, wreaking havoc on their dreams of becoming Americans, immigration attorneys told The Associated Press.

""It was my dream to serve in the military,"" said reservist Lucas Calixto, an immigrant from Brazil who is suing the Army.

""Since this country has been so good to me, I thought it was the least I could do to give back to my adopted country and serve in the United States military.""

Pentagon and Army officials declined comment, citing the pending litigation.

""Immigrants have been serving in the Army since 1775,"" said retired Army Reserve Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, an immigration rights lawyer from Alaska.

""We wouldn't have won the revolution without immigrants. And we're not going to win the global war on terrorism today without immigrants.""

During an interview with British tabloid The Sun, Trump said, â€œI think whatâ€™s happened to Europe is a shame. I think the immigration allowing the immigration to take place in Europe is a shame. I think it changed the fabric of Europe. And unless you act very quickly, itâ€™s never going to be what it was, and I donâ€™t mean that in a positive way. I think youâ€™re losing your culture.â€

3NRZ1LDP7XOHOD8H9TIKL2HAOUPPZP,"Tibbetts murder suspect eluded a flawed system, says Melania Trump's immigration lawyer","Melania Trump's immigration attorney - and frequent critic of her husband's policies - says the federal employment verification system that's become a talking point in the Mollie Tibbetts murder case is unreliable and vulnerable to fraud.

â€œThis is a perfect example of how we cannot trust employers to involve themselves in the policing of immigration,â€ said Michael Wildes, author of a new book about immigration called â€œSafe Haven in America.""

Wildes said the federal system intended to flag those not authorized to live or work in the country can't be counted on, as shown by Tibbetts murder suspect's Christhian Riveraâ€™s apparent ability to beat the system by working under someone elseâ€™s name.

Wildes, who also represented Melania Trump's parents, told Fox News employer verification programs like E-Verify, and another program that depends on checking the Social Security Administration database, are vulnerable.

Rivera, the 24-year-old Mexican national who has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of the 20-year-old Iowa college student, was hired to work at Yarrabee Farms four years ago, after he passed employment eligibility vetting, the employers said.

Rivera reportedly submitted another identity, which evidently showed up on the Social Security Administrationâ€™s system as legitimate. The Social Security Administration itself reported several years ago that just under two million immigrants worked in 2010 using a Social Security number that was not theirs.

Wildes, a former federal prosecutor, said the solution to illegal immigration and to keeping dangerous people out of the country is to have tighter cooperation among local, county and state law enforcement agencies and immigration officials.

But Wildes also criticized what he called the politicizing of the Tibbetts murder.

â€œWe should not scapegoat all immigrantsâ€ because of Riveraâ€™s crime, Wildes said, denouncing â€œthe political discourse on immigration and the lack of real advancement for our safety and economic needs.â€

Wildes said employers often are left to â€œact on good faith,"" relying on documents that prospective workers present as legitimate, and running them through government programs.

â€œThey go beyond just the ritual of collecting documents to also making sure the documents are verified, but theyâ€™re not forensic experts,â€ said Wildes, adding that itâ€™s nearly impossible for people who lack the training to spot fraudulent documents.

This is a perfect example of how we cannot trust employers to involve themselves in the policing of immigration. The [verification system] supported the notion that [Rivera] was permitted to work here, how is that possible? - Michael Wildes, immigration attorney

The owners of Yarrabee Farms said at first that they had run Riveraâ€™s documents through E-Verify, which checks prospective workers I-9 forms through federal databases to confirm their legal status and eligibility to work.

Later, however, they said they had not used E-Verify, but relied on the Social Security Administration. They told reporters Rivera had showed them a state-issued photo ID and a social security card - in someone elseâ€™s name.

""We screen every applicant through the Social Security Administration social security number verification service,"" Dane Lang said at a news conference Wednesday. ""What we learned in the past 24 hours is that our employee is not exactly who he said he was.""

""Our family member who handles the verification process believed the systems were the same,"" Lang said, referring to SSA and E-Verify.

There were conflicting reports about Riveraâ€™s immigration status, and how long he has been in the U.S.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Michael Bars told ABC News: ""A search of records by USCIS revealed Rivera did not make any DACA requests nor were any grants given. We have found no record in our systems indicating he has any lawful immigration status.""

Riveraâ€™s attorney, Allan Richards, refuted that, claiming in a court document that his client has legal status.

Most, though not all, people with legal status have permission to work in the United States. If Rivera did have legal status, it is unclear why he would have hidden his true identity while seeking work.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/23/tibbetts-murder-suspect-eluded-flawed-system-says-melania-trumps-immigration-lawyer.html,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Republican', 'Democratic']","['5', '5', '5', '5', '5']"
372AGES0I5NDVVOHL3YOTC1EHZNXRA,US Attorney General Jeff Sessions says his office 'will not be improperly influenced' amid attacks from Trump,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said his office ""will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,"" amid a fresh round of attacks by President Donald Trump.

The attorney general spoke out in the wake of a Fox News interview in which the president said Mr Sessions had failed to take control of the Justice Department and had erred in recusing himself from the Russia investigation.

In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, the attorney general said: ""I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the President's agenda.""

""While I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,"" he added. ""I demand the highest standards, and when they are not met, I take action.""

Mr Trump lashed out at the attorney general in a Fox and Friends interview aired on Thursday morning, calling it ""incredible"" that Mr Sessions ""never took control"" of the Justice Department.

He also returned to his familiar complaint about Mr Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian meddling in the US election. Mr Sessions stepped down from the investigation last year, when it was revealed that he failed to his disclose contacts with the Russian ambassador during his Senate confirmation hearing.

""Even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself, and then you wouldn't have put him in,"" Mr Trump told Fox's Ainsely Earhardt on Thursday.

""He took the job and then he said I''m going to recuse myself'. I said, 'What kind of a man is this?'"" the president added

Senator Lindsey Graham told Bloomberg that morning that it was ""very likely"" Mr Trump would replace the attorney general soon.

Mr Sessions reportedly arrived at the White House on Thursday afternoon, shortly after issuing his response, to discuss criminal sentencing reform with the president and adviser Jared Kushner.

Mr Trump and Mr Sessions have sparred repeatedly since taking office, despite sharing similar outlooks on issues like illegal immigration and drug policy. Mr Sessions was one of the president's earliest supporters during the campaign, but has angered Mr Trump by recusing himself from the Russia investigation, and by refusing to prosecute Mr Trump's campaign rival, Hillary Clinton.

""'GOP Lawmakers asking Sessions to Investigate [former FBI Director James] Comey and Hillary Clinton',"" Mr Trump tweeted in April, quoting a Fox News report.

32K26U12DO6RQW0H3N2M02NPMNOVDZ,Trump Calls Out Theresa May's Brexit Deal in Chaotic Start to U.K. Visit,"(BLENHEIM PALACE, England) -- Dishing up a fresh dose of chaos on his European tour, President Donald Trump left behind a contentious NATO gathering in Brussels and moved on to Britain, where a pomp-filled welcome ceremony was soon overshadowed by an interview in which Trump blasted Prime Minister Theresa May, blamed London's mayor for terror attacks against the city and argued that Europe was ""losing its culture"" because of immigration.

Trump, in an interview with The Sun newspaper, said he felt unwelcome in London because of protests, including plans to fly a giant balloon over Parliament on Friday that depicts him as an angry baby in a diaper.

""I guess when they put out blimps to make me feel unwelcome, no reason for me to go to London,"" he said.

Trump, in the interview given before he left Brussels for the U.K., accused May of ruining what her country stands to gain from the Brexit vote to leave the European Union. He said her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, would make an ""excellent"" prime minister, speaking just days after Johnson resigned his position in protest over May's Brexit plans.

Trump added that May's ""soft"" blueprint for the U.K.'s future dealings with the EU would probably ""kill"" any future trade deals with the United States.

""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the U.K., so it will probably kill the deal,"" Trump told the paper.

Trump, who has compared his own election to the June 2016 referendum in which a majority of British voters supported leaving the EU, complained that, ""The deal she is striking is a much different deal than the one the people voted on.""

He also told the tabloid that he'd shared advice with May during Britain's negotiations with the EU and she ignored it.

Details from Trump's interview with the paper became public as Trump was attending a black-tie dinner with May to welcome him to Britain with pomp and pageantry.

As for Johnson, Trump said: ""I think he would be a great prime minister. I think he's got what it takes. He added, ""I think he is a great representative for your country.""

On Thursday night, hundreds of demonstrators chanted outside the U.S. ambassador's residence where Trump was staying on the outskirts of London, providing a preview of the forceful protests expected on Friday.

Trump acknowledged he didn't feel welcome in the city, and blamed that in part on Mayor Sadiq Khan, who gave protesters permission to fly the 20-foot-tall balloon depicting Trump as an angry baby.

Trump also blamed recent terrorist attacks there on Khan, who is a Muslim. The president claimed Europe is ""losing its culture"" because of immigration from the Middle East and Africa.

""Allowing the immigration to take place in Europe is a sham,"" he said. ""I think it changed the fabric of Europe and, unless you act very quickly, it's never going to be what it was and I don't mean that in a positive way.""

In sharp contrast to the president sharp words, Trump's first event in England was an oasis of warm greetings at an evening reception at Blenheim Palace, birthplace of Winston Churchill, the larger-than-life British leader cited by the president as a model of leadership. That was just one of several helicopter rides on the agenda for Trump, whose staff opted to keep him largely out of central London and the swarms of demonstrators who are likely to provide some of the defining images of his first official trip to the U.K.

Trump's Marine One departure from the ambassador's residence was met by jeers from demonstrators banging pots and pans, and another pack of protesters lined roads near the palace. Some of their signs read: ""Dump Trump,"" ""Lock Him Up,"" and ""There Will Be Hell Toupee."" Police worked overtime, their days off cancelled.

Trump was greeted at the palace by May, whose government has been rocked by resignations from ongoing tumult over Brexit.

The outdoor arrival ceremony at Blenheim -- Trump wore a tuxedo and first lady Melania Trump a butter-yellow, chiffon off-the-shoulder gown -- was a grand affair marked by a military band in bearskin hats, hundreds of business leaders in black tie and gorgeous setting sunlight.

The mood was far less jovial in Belgium earlier in the day.

During his 28 hours there, Trump had disparaged longtime NATO allies, cast doubt on his commitment to the mutual-defense organization and sent the 29-member pact into frenzied emergency session.

Then, in a head-snapping pivot at the end, he declared the alliance a ""fine-tuned machine"" that had acceded to his demands to speed up increases in military spending to relieve pressure on the U.S. budget. But there was little evidence other leaders had bowed to his wishes on that front.

Trump claimed member nations had agreed to boost their defense budgets significantly and reaffirmed -- after days of griping that the U.S. was being taken advantage of by its allies -- that the U.S. remains faithful to the accord.

""The United States' commitment to NATO remains very strong,"" Trump told reporters at a surprise news conference following an emergency session of NATO members held to address his threats.

Neither Trump nor NATO offered specifics on what Trump said he had achieved. French President Emmanuel Macron quickly disputed Trump's claim that NATO allies had agreed to boost defense spending beyond their existing goal of 2 percent of gross domestic product by 2024.

""There is a communique that was published yesterday; it's very detailed,"" Macron said. ""It confirms the goal of 2 percent by 2024. That's all.""",https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-calls-theresa-may-apos-004427355.html,"['Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['2', '2', '3', '1', '1']"
3T2EL38U0N2DJU9H8O9OOMR9LDLXQ9,War hero and presidential candidate John McCain dies at 81,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, who faced down his captors in a Vietnam prisoner of war camp with jut-jawed defiance and later turned his rebellious streak into a 35-year political career that took him to Congress and the Republican presidential nomination, died Saturday after battling brain cancer for more than a year. He was 81.

McCain, with his irascible grin and fighter-pilot moxie, was a fearless and outspoken voice on policy and politics to the end, unswerving in his defense of democratic values and unflinching in his criticism of his fellow Republican, President Donald Trump. He was elected to the Senate from Arizona six times but twice thwarted in seeking the presidency.

An upstart presidential bid in 2000 didn't last long. Eight years later, he fought back from the brink of defeat to win the GOP nomination, only to be overpowered by Democrat Barack Obama. McCain chose a little-known Alaska governor as his running mate in that race, and turned Sarah Palin into a national political figure.

After losing to Obama in an electoral landslide, McCain returned to the Senate determined not to be defined by a failed presidential campaign in which his reputation as a maverick had faded. In the politics of the moment and in national political debate over the decades, McCain energetically advanced his ideas and punched back hard at critics -- Trump not least among them.

The scion of a decorated military family, McCain embraced his role as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, pushing for aggressive U.S. military intervention overseas and eager to contribute to ""defeating the forces of radical Islam that want to destroy America.""

Asked how he wanted to be remembered, McCain said simply: ""That I made a major contribution to the defense of the nation.""

One dramatic vote he cast in the twilight of his career in 2017 will not soon be forgotten, either: As the decisive ""no"" on Senate GOP legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, McCain became the unlikely savior of Obama's trademark legislative achievement.

Taking a long look back in his valedictory memoir, ""The Restless Wave,"" McCain wrote of the world he inhabited: ""I hate to leave it. But I don't have a complaint. Not one. It's been quite a ride. I've known great passions, seen amazing wonders, fought in a war, and helped make a peace. ... I made a small place for myself in the story of America and the history of my times.""

Throughout his long tenure in Congress, McCain played his role with trademark verve, at one hearing dismissing a protester by calling out, ""Get out of here, you low-life scum.""

But it was just as notable when he held his sharp tongue, in service of a party or political gain.

Most remarkably, he stuck by Trump as the party's 2016 presidential nominee even when Trump questioned his status as a war hero by saying: ""I like people who weren't captured."" McCain declared the comment offensive to veterans, but urged the men ""put it behind us and move forward.""

His breaking point with Trump was the release a month before the election of a lewd audio in which Trump said he could kiss and grab women. McCain withdrew his support and said he'd write in ""some good conservative Republican who's qualified to be president.""

By the time McCain cast his vote against the GOP health bill, six months into Trump's presidency, the two men were openly at odds. Trump railed against McCain publicly over the vote, and McCain remarked that he no longer listened to what Trump had to say because ""there's no point in it.""

By then, McCain had disclosed his brain cancer diagnosis and returned to Arizona to seek treatment. His vote to kill the GOP's years-long Obamacare repeal drive -- an issue McCain himself had campaigned on -- came not long after the diagnosis, a surprising capstone to his legislative career.

In his final months, McCain did not go quietly, frequently jabbing at Trump and his policies from the remove of his Hidden Valley family retreat in Arizona. He opposed the president's nominee for CIA director because of her past role in overseeing torture, scolded Trump for alienating U.S. allies at an international summit, labeled the administration's zero-tolerance immigration policy ""an affront to the decency of the American people"" and denounced the Trump-Putin summit in Helsinki as a ""tragic mistake"" in which the president put on ""one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.""

On Aug. 13, Trump signed into law a $716 billion defense policy bill named in honor of the senator. Trump signed the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act in a ceremony at a military base in New York -- without one mention of McCain.

John Sidney McCain III was born in 1936 in the Panana Canal zone, where his father was stationed in the military.

He followed his father and grandfather, the Navy's first father-and-son set of four-star admirals, to the Naval Academy, where he enrolled in what he described a ""four-year course of insubordination and rebellion."" His family yawned at the performance. A predilection for what McCain described as ""quick tempers, adventurous spirits, and love for the country's uniform"" was encoded in his family DNA.

On October 1967, McCain was on his 23rd bombing round over North Vietnam when he was shot out of the sky and taken prisoner.

Year upon year of solitary confinement, deprivation, beatings and other acts of torture left McCain so despairing that at one point he weakly attempted suicide. But he also later wrote that his captors had spared him the worst of the abuse inflicted on POWs because his father was a famous admiral. ""I knew that my father's identity was directly related to my survival,"" he wrote in one of his books.

When McCain's Vietnamese captors offered him early release as a propaganda ploy, McCain refused to play along, insisting that those captured first should be the first set free.

In his darkest hour in Vietnam, McCain's will had been broken and he signed a confession that said, ""I am a black criminal and I have performed deeds of an air pirate.""

Even then, though, McCain refused to make an audio recording of his confession and used stilted written language to signal he had signed it under duress. And, to the end of his captivity, he continued to exasperate his captors with his defiance.

Throughout, McCain played to the bleachers, shouting obscenities at guards to bolster the spirits of fellow captives. Appointed by the POWs to act as camp entertainment officer, chaplain and communications chief, McCain imparted comic relief, literary tutorials, news of the day, even religious sustenance.

Bud Day, a former cellmate and Medal of Honor winner, said McCain's POW experience ""took some great iron and turned him into steel.""

McCain returned home from his years as a POW on crutches and never regained full mobility in his arms and leg.

He once said he'd ""never known a prisoner of war who felt he could fully explain the experience to anyone who had not shared it."" Still he described the time as formative and ""a bit of a turning point in me appreciating the value of serving a cause greater than your self-interest.""

But it did not tame his wild side, and his first marriage, to Carol Shepp, was a casualty of what he called ""my greatest moral failing."" The marriage to Shepp, who had been in a crippling car accident while McCain was imprisoned, ended amiably. McCain admitted the breakup was caused by ""my own selfishness and immaturity.""

One month after his divorce, McCain in 1981 married Cindy Hensley, the daughter of a wealthy beer distributor in Arizona.

In one day, McCain signed his Navy discharge papers and flew west with his new wife to a new life. By 1982, he'd been elected to the House and four years later to an open Senate seat. He and Cindy had four children, to add to three from his first marriage. Their youngest was adopted from Bangladesh.

McCain cultivated a conservative voting record and a reputation as a tightwad with taxpayer dollars. But just months into his Senate career, he made what he called ""the worst mistake"" of his life. He participated in two meetings with bank regulators on behalf of Charles Keating, a friend, campaign contributor and savings and loan financier later convicted of securities fraud.

As the industry collapsed, McCain was tagged as one of the Keating Five -- senators who, to varying degrees, were accused of trying to get regulators to ease up on Keating. McCain was cited by the Senate Ethics Committee for ""poor judgment.""

To have his honor questioned, he said, was in some ways worse than the torture he endured in Vietnam.

In the 1990s, McCain shouldered another wrenching issue, the long effort to account for American soldiers still missing from the war and to normalize relations with Vietnam.

""People don't remember how ugly the POW-MIA issue was,"" former Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey, a fellow Vietnam veteran, later recalled in crediting McCain for standing up to significant opposition. ""I heard people scream in his face, holding him responsible for the deaths of POWs.""

Over three decades in the Senate, McCain became a standard-bearer for reforming campaign donations. He denounced pork-barrel spending for legislators' pet projects and cultivated a reputation as a deficit hawk and an independent voice. His experience as a POW made him a leading voice against the use of torture. He achieved his biggest legislative successes when making alliances with Democrats.

But faced with a tough GOP challenge for his Senate seat in 2010, McCain disowned chapters in his past and turned to the right on a number of hot-button issues, including gays in the military and climate change. And when the Supreme Court in 2010 overturned the campaign finance restrictions that he'd work so hard to enact, McCain seemed resigned.

""It is what it is,"" he said.

After surviving that election, though, McCain took on conservatives in his party over the federal debt and Democrats over foreign policy. McCain never softened on his opposition to the U.S. use of torture, even in the recalibrations of the post-9/11 world. When the Senate in 2014 released a report on the CIA's harsh interrogation techniques at secret overseas facilities after the 9/11 attacks, McCain said the issue wasn't ""about our enemies. It's about us. It's about who we were, who we are and who we aspire to be. It's about how we represent ourselves to the world.""

During his final years in the Senate, McCain was perhaps the loudest advocate for U.S. military involvement overseas - in Iraq, Syria, Libya and more. That often made him a critic of first Obama and then Trump, and placed him further out of step with the growing isolationism within the GOP.

In October 2017, McCain unleashed some his most blistering criticism of Trump's ""America first"" foreign policy approach -- without mentioning the president by name -- in describing a ""half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.""

Few politicians matched McCain's success as an author. His 1999 release ""Faith Of My Fathers"" was a million seller that was highly praised and helped launch his run for president in 2000. His most recent bestseller and planned farewell, ""The Restless Wave,"" came out in May 2018.

3XAOZ9UYR095TTOO1VOHTDN8GBYQ1S,"Trump Requests Detention Space, Tent Cities to Detain 12K Illegal Aliens","President Trumpâ€™s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking to house and detain up to 12,000 illegal aliens in Department of Defense facilities.

In a letter to the Defense Department, DHS officials have asked that enough detention space be made available for the agency to detain up to 12,000 illegal aliens, specifically border crossing family units.

DHS officials say that if the Defense Department does not have the facilities to house that number, DHS is requesting that the agency identify land space to build â€œsemi-separate, soft-sided camp facilities capable of sheltering up to 4,000 people, at three separate locations,â€ the letter states.

Preferably, DHS officials say they want these tent cities built in regions closest to the U.S.-Mexico border, in either Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, or California.

At the least, DHS officials are requiring that facilities be found and converted or tent cities be built in the next 45 days to accommodate 2,000 illegal aliens.

For weeks, the Trump administration has worked closely with the Pentagon to find more detention space for border crossers in order to at least temporarily end the process known as â€œCatch and Release,â€ where illegal aliens are released into the U.S. while they await their immigration hearings.

""Detaining the asylum-seekers and border-crossers in tent citiesâ€¦ would speed up the court processâ€¦ most significantly, the construction of tent cities would, at least temporarily, end Catch and Release."" https://t.co/uExGiVgnVA â€” John Binder (@JxhnBinder) April 25, 2018

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has already asked the Defense Department to find detention space to detain 20,000 unaccompanied alien children who crossed the southern border alone.

For months, Breitbart News and immigration experts have noted that DHS could deal with the ongoing illegal immigration surge at the border by having deployed troops build tent cities on the border.",https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/07/01/trump-requests-detention-space-tent-cities-to-detain-12k-illegal-aliens/,"['Republican', 'Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Neutral']","['5', '5', '5', '5', '5']"
3XQ4XW3ODAUOVULXC3D0TWCEQS62ST,Minnesota Twins' Fernando Rodney leaves game to become U.S. citizen,"CLOSE Bryce Harper got emotional as he reflected on what it meant to win the Home Run Derby in front of his home crowd at Nationals Park. USA TODAY

Fernando Rodney became a U.S. citizen on Monday. (Photo: Jordan Johnson-USA TODAY Sports)

The Minnesota Twins raised some eyebrows Sunday when they brought Fernando Rodney into the game in the fifth inning, an unconventional spot for a closer who had not pitched that early in a game in more than a dozen years.

Then, in an Instagram post Monday, Rodney revealed the reason behind his early appearance: He had to travel to Miami that afternoon to finalize his U.S. citizenship.

""After 19 years in this wonderful country today I am blessed to say that I am an official US Citizen,"" Rodney wrote in the post. ""Today I fly the American Flag but in my heart always hold my Dominican Flag. I want to thank all those who have been with me throughout the process and especially thank the @twins organizations for allowing me to catch my flight.""

Amid speculation that the Twins were trying to showcase Rodney for a trade or using an unusual mid-game strategy, Twins manager Paul Molitor explained after the game that the 41-year-old had to catch a flight to Miami for an immigration hearing Monday morning. It wasn't until Monday that Rodney revealed the hearing was the final step in his journey to citizenship.

Rodney only faced two Tampa Bay Rays hitters Sunday, striking out Carlos Gomez before inducing an inning-ending groundout from Mallex Smith, but the Twins later rallied to an 11-7 win.

""It worked out pretty well because he got a couple of really big outs,"" Molitor said, according to The Minneapolis Star Tribune.

3ZXNP4Z39S38DINDY6XUD1FR9EK7L0,Why you should be skeptical that a progressive primary victor can't win in Nebraska,"Long before the primary was decided, most prognosticators concluded that Eastman would be a weaker nominee that Ashford. Observers argued that the GOP would be able to portray Eastman as too liberal for Omaha, a problem that the more moderate Ashford would in theory be able to avoid. However, despite the conventional wisdom, it's far from clear that Ashford was actually the better bet.

Back in 2016, Ashford lost to Bacon 49-48, which was almost identical to the margin of Hillary Clinton's close defeat in the district, so he may not have had the crossover appeal his supporters believed he'd have this year. And Ashford's fundraisingâ€”a practice he openly disdainedâ€”was always weak, even as an incumbent and despite all his connections. Even though he'd been running for almost a year, his total haul at the end of the first quarter of the year put him at 97th among credible Democratic challengers.

But while Ashford was certainly an imperfect candidate, he was at least a known one. The only thing many national observers know about Eastman is that she beat a Blue Dog-endorsed former congressman while running to the left, so it's pretty easy to caricature her as something like a progressive version of a tea partier. But like most caricatures, it would be inaccurate. Eastman's support for universal health care, tuition-free college, and gun safety reform are about where the Democratic base is now, and these policies tend to poll well with the larger public, too.

The GOP certainly won't waste time trying to portray Eastman's support for expanding Medicare to all as some malign scheme to impose punitive taxes and turn America into a grim socialist hellscape â€¦ but it's not like they don't already plan to use that line of attack in every competitive race they can. It will be up to Eastman to push back and make a positive argument about her views rather than let the GOP define her.

One further potential concern for Eastman is that her fundraising up until now has been pretty slow (she was 152nd on the list), but undoubtedly her ability to bring in money was constrained by the fact that she was running against an establishment favorite in a primary. Now that she's the nominee in a competitive seat, she should have a much easier time raising the cash she'll need.

Senate

â— FL-Sen: Republican Gov. Rick Scott and his allies have continued to rain down money on Florida's Senate race, and Scott's latest Spanish-language TV ad ups his total spending to a huge $8 million after just a month in the race. Outside groups have also chipped in $3 million on his behalf, bringing the total Republican spending to nearly $12 million.

Meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson has yet to go up on the air, but he was sitting on a $10 million war chest as of April 1. While political science research has found the effects of ads diminish very quickly, Scott's enormous personal wealth could let him air all the ads he could want, and Nelson will need every dollar he can get.

â— IN-Sen: Senate Majority PAC has launched their first TV ad against newly minted GOP nominee Mike Braun, which they're backing with a $500,000 buy. The spot capitalizes on a recent AP report that portrayed Braun's business practices in a negative light, focusing on how he was a hypocrite when it came to outsourcing jobs overseas and that he faced lawsuits over unsafe working conditions and wage theft.

â— NV-Sen, NV-04: The Professional Fire Fighters of Nevada union has endorsed Republican Sen. Dean Heller's re-election bid and former Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford's campaign to regain his old 4th District.

â— WI-Sen: Wisconsin Next PAC has dropped $500,000 for an ad buy on TV, radio, and digital on behalf of Republican state Sen. Leah Vukmir. The TV version highlights her recent endorsement from the state GOP and labels her a consistent conservative.

Gubernatorial

â— CT-Gov: Democratic firm Tremont Public Advisors has conducted an online poll that included candidates who recently dropped out, but they did test one plausible general election matchup that has good news for Democrats. The pollster finds businessman Ned Lamont, the Democratic front-runner, with a 50-40 lead over Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton, who just won the Republican endorsement ahead of the August primary. However, there's been little general election polling to compare with this.

Meanwhile on the Republican side, attorney Peter Lumaj dropped out after failing to obtain the 15 percent support at the recent GOP convention needed to proceed to the primary without having to gather voter signatures.

â— FL-Gov: A new internal poll from Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, conducted by Change Research, argues that, unlike other surveys of the August Democratic primary that have shown him a distant third, he's actually a somewhat close second. The poll finds wealthy Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine in front at 20, but Gillum and former Rep. Gwen Graham are tied at 13 apiece, while businessman Chris King is well behind at just 3. Undecided voters make up a majority of the sampleâ€”52 percentâ€”so these numbers suggest a potentially volatile race as well.

(As an interesting aside, this poll was conducted online and also featured an informed ballot portion that included candidate photos, a methodology we don't think we've seen before.)

Speaking of King, he's looking to burst his way out of the caboose with his first flight of TV ads. According to Politico's Marc Caputo, he's reserved $823,000 in four broadcast markets across the state (Gainesville, Orlando, Panama City, and West Palm Beach), and Caputo suggests that more may come.

His initial spot is a little more catchy than most: A waiter asks a man in an expensive suit if he'd like ""more sugar, sir?"", to which the well-heeled patron responds, ""Yes, of course."" The server then proceeds to dump an entire bag of granulated sugar into the man's mug. At this point, King intervenes to explain, ""It's the same old politics: Big Sugar buys influence in Tallahassee and then pollutes our environment."" King goes on to vow never to ""take a dime"" from the sugar industry and promises to expand Medicaid, support affordable housing, and increase community college opportunities.

â— GA-Gov: With less than week to go before Georgia's primaries, Atlanta-based TV station WXIA has released a new poll from SurveyUSA of both the Democratic and Republican contests, as well as two potential general election matchups. Among Democrats, former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams has a wide 43-24 lead on former state Rep. Stacey Evans, a similar gap to Abrams' 33-15 advantage in a University of Georgia poll last month.

Meanwhile, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle is the front-runner on the GOP side, with a 35-17 lead on Secretary of State Brian Kemp. State Sen. Hunter Hill is the only other candidate in double digits with 10, while the fourth main player, businessman Clay Tippins, is at just 8. If Cagle can't snatch enough of the undecided vote to clear 50 percent, he'd face a runoff with the second-place finisher on July 24.

Cagle would also begin the general election with a similar lead on both Democrats: 46-41 versus Abrams and 45-41 over Evans. But this poll shows there's a real chance he'll have to spend another two months fighting for his party's nomination, while there's no possibility of a Democratic runoff since there are only two candidates competing.

â— MN-Gov: In a reflection both of his weakness with party activists and his belief that he doesn't need them in order to win the Republican nomination, former Gov. Tim Pawlenty announced this week that he would not compete for the state GOP's endorsement at its convention next month. A Pawlenty spokesperson offered the lame excuse that his candidate's ""late entry into the race effectively precluded a fair fight"" for the endorsement, but the reality is that delegates are likely to favor Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson, who was the Republican nominee for governor in 2014.

But unlike in other states, where winning a convention might come with tangible benefits (such as guaranteeing a spot on the primary ballot), in Minnesota, the principle outcome, at most, is that some or perhaps all of those who don't win might choose to drop out. The emphasis here is on ""choose"": No one is obligated to quit, or even to contend for the party's endorsement in the first place. Candidates are free to forge on to the August primary no matter what happens at the convention, and that's exactly what Pawlenty plans to do. And with his greater resources and name recognition, he's the favorite, even if Johnson wins the Republican endorsement.

Meanwhile on the Democratic side, the SEIU State Council has endorsed state Rep. Erin Murphy, who is relying on a win at the June state party convention.

â— NV-Gov: Clark County Commissioner Steve Sisolak's latest Democratic primary ad features Rep. Dina Titus bemoaning the attacks against him as false. Titus claims Sisolak is a ""progressive Democrat"" who supports a woman's right to choose and will stand up to Trump and the NRA.

â— SC-Gov: Palmetto PAC, which is supporting Gov. Henry McMaster in the GOP primary, has debuted a TV ad attacking former state cabinet official Catherine Templeton. The spot uses footage of Trump uttering his classic, ""You're fired,"" to call Templeton a failure who was fired from three government positions.

â— WY-Gov: Businessman Sam Galeotos has unveiled his first TV ad ahead of the Aug. 21 Republican primary. The spot focuses on his business success, saying he's a conservative who wants to create jobs by getting government out of the way of small businesses.

House

â— CA-45: Democratic pollster PPP has conducted a hypothetical general election survey of California's 45th District for the progressive group End Citizens United, and their results have good news for Democrats. The poll has UC Irvine professor Katie Porter, a Democrat, with a 46-43 edge over Republican Rep. Mimi Walters. However, they did not release any results for the top-two primary, where Porter and fellow UC Irvine professor and Democrat Dave Min are likely in a competitive race for the chance to face Walters.

â— CT-05: Businessman Rich DuPont has announced he'll continue to the August primary after attaining enough support to do so at the recent Republican convention. He'll face former Meriden Mayor Manny Santos, who has the party's endorsement, and retired psychology professor Ruby O'Neill.

â— KS-02: State Sen. Dennis Pyle has decided to make a late GOP primary bid to succeed retiring GOP Rep. Lynn Jenkins, whom he actually lost to by a relatively decent 57-43 in a 2010 primary challenge when she was seeking her second term. Pyle joins a GOP field that includes Army veteran Steve Watkins and state Sens. Steve Fitzgerald and Caryn Tyson.

Republicans have struggled to find a strong contender for this 56-37 Trump district, while likely Democratic nominee Paul Davis continues to stockpile his cash. However, a hardline conservative like Pyle may not be the GOP's white knight. Despite holding a state Senate seat that backed Trump by 71-23 and Romney by 68-29, Pyle massively underperformed with a 58-42 re-election victory in 2016, while he only won by a razor-thin 50.7-49.3 margin in 2012. His association with the failed budgetary policies of former Gov. Sam Brownback could make him similarly vulnerable if he becomes the GOP nominee in the 2nd District.

â— MT-AL: Attorney John Heenan has launched his first TV ad ahead of the June 5 Democratic primary. It features a woman whose bank tried to foreclose on her house, but she says Heenan took on her case and successfully stopped them. The ad argues Heenan will fight for Montana families.

â— NM-01: Former deputy Bernalillo County Assessor Damian Lara's first Democratic primary ad shows the candidate detained in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency van driving along a highway while he talks about the danger of letting Trump get his way on deporting undocumented immigrants. Lara promises to stand up to Trump and stop him from terrorizing immigrants.

â— NY-19: Retired Army intelligence officer Pat Ryan has begun airing his first TV ad ahead of next month's Democratic primary, and it packs a powerful punch on the issue of gun safety. Ryan relays how, after he came home from the Iraq War, he started a company to develop technology to protect soldiers. The ad then shows him in a warehouse where he holds up an assault rifle and says, ""... we were protecting them from weapons like this.""

Ryan bemoans how assault rifles are on our streets and in our schools, asserting that if children are going to go up against them, they should have the same body armor as soldiers. While he provides a voice-over, the spot shows several young children suiting up in military gear while they go to school, and Ryan closes by offering a far more serious solution: ""Or we could just get rid of assault rifles.""

â— OH-12: On behalf of the progressive group End Citizens United, Democratic pollster PPP took a look at the August special election and found Republican Troy Balderson leading Democrat Danny O'Connor 45-43. This is the first poll of the general election we've seen since both candidates won their primaries last week, so we're still eager for more data about how things are looking in this 53-42 Trump seat.

â— TX-02: With Honor Fund, a super PAC that backs veterans in both parties, is out with a spot praising retired Navy SEAL Dan Crenshaw and bashing state Rep. Kevin Roberts, his rival in Tuesday's GOP runoff. The narrator asks what ""politician Kevin Roberts"" thinks of Crenshaw's service before playing a recording of Roberts asking, ""You want to get bad policy? Send a bunch of people who have never worked in the real world."" The narrator takes umbrage at that and reminds the audience that Crenshaw lost his eye in Afghanistan only to deploy two more times, but Roberts worked in a law firm.

As the Houston Chronicle recounts, Roberts' ""bad policy"" line came at a forum a few weeks ago after Crenshaw touted his Harvard degree and work in public policy. Roberts insisted afterward Crenshaw started attacking him over it a few days later that he was only talking about business experience, which he compared favorably to Crenshaw's Ivy League master's degree. The whole thing is reminiscent of John Glenn's ""Gold Star Speech"" during his debate with Howard Metzenbaum in the 1974 Ohio Senate Democratic primary. (Spoiler alert: Glenn won.)

â— TX-21: The Club for Growth has thrown down another $140,000 on a TV spot for next week's GOP runoff that tries to connect businessman Matt McCall to Nancy Pelosi in a pretty indirect way.

The narrator argues that McCall ran for Congress twice and ""got swamped,"" which is true, and says that if he loses again, it will make Nancy Pelosi speaker. The ad doesn't mention that McCall's two losses were in primaries against retiring Rep. Lamar Smith, though they're probably right that McCall would be a weaker general election candidate in this 52-42 Trump seat than the Club-backed Chip Roy. Still, it's hard to see this seat being the district that decides control of the House.

The rest of the spot argues that McCall ""uses the same fake news attacks against Chip Roy that liberals use against Donald Trump."" We're not sure what that means, but hearing ""Speaker Pelosi!"" and ""Fake News!"" spoken in anger in a primary ad may be all Republican voters are looking for.

Legislative

â— Special Elections: Johnny Longtorso recaps Tuesday's proceedings, in which Democrats and Republicans swapped a pair of seats in Pennsylvania:

Alabama SD-26: Democrats had no trouble holding this one: David Burkette defeated Republican DJ Johnson by an 89-11 margin. Alabama HD-04: This was a Republican hold. Parker Moore defeated Democrat Juanita Allen Healy by a 67-20 margin, with independent Pete Willis taking 12 percent. Pennsylvania HD-48: Republicans scored a pickup here: Tim O'Neal defeated Democrat Clark Mitchell Jr. by a 54-44 margin, with Libertarian Demosthenes Agoris taking the remaining 2 percent. Pennsylvania HD-68: This was an easy Republican hold. Clint Owlett defeated Democrat Carrie Heath by a 76-24 margin. Pennsylvania HD-178: Democrats picked this one up. Helen Tai defeated Republican Wendi Thomas by a 50.4 to 49.6 margin.

Primary Recap

â— ID-Gov: Lt. Gov. Brad Little defeated Rep. Raul Labrador 38-31 to win the GOP primary to succeed retiring Gov. Butch Otter; physician and developer Tommy Ahlquist, who began airing ads a year before the primary and decisively outspent his primary foes, came in third with 27 percent. Little will be the clear favorite in this very red state against former state Rep. Paulette Jordan, who upset wealthy 2014 nominee A.J. Balukoff 59-40. Idaho is a very red state, but if Jordan pulls off another upset in November, she would become the nation's first Native American governor.

Little, who hails from a famous ranching family, was the choice of much of the state political establishment. Otter backed him early, and Sen. Jim Risch and Rep. Mike Simpson both endorsed him as well. All three candidates represented different wings of the party: Little appealed to more establishment types, Labrador was a prominent tea partier, and Ahlquist portrayed himself as a businessman outsider. But Ahlquist and Labrador also both hailed from the state's large Mormon community, and they may have cost one another votes.

It's also worth noting that with Labrador's defeat, four of the six GOP House members who have run for statewide office have lost their primaries. Last week, both Todd Rokita and Luke Messer lost in Indiana's Senate race, while Evan Jenkins was defeated in the West Virginia Senate primary. Ohio's Jim Renacci and Pennsylvania's Lou Barletta did win their Senate primaries, though they had the full support of the White House and party establishment against underwhelming foes.

â— OR-Gov: State Rep. Knute Buehler defeated businessman Sam Carpenter 47-29 to win the GOP primary to take on Democratic Gov. Kate Brown. Carpenter had been going after the self-proclaimed ""pro-choice"" Buehler on abortion, and he was trying to establish himself as the main anti-abortion candidate. But retired Navy pilot Greg Wooldridge took 19 percent of the vote, and he and Carpenter seem to have split the same group of voters too much to give either of them a chance against Buehler.

Oregon is usually a reliably blue state, but Team Red hopes that Buehler can be the first Republican to win the governorship since Vic Atiyeh was re-elected in 1982. While Buehler used most of his war chest on the primary, he's close to plenty of big donors, and he should have plenty of money in a state that has no contribution limits. Still, he'll face an uphill climb against Brown in what's looking like a tough year for the GOP nationwide. Interestingly enough, this will also be the second time the two have tangled: Back in 2012, Brown beat him 51-43 in her re-election campaign for secretary of state.

â— PA-Gov: Wealthy state Sen. Scott Wagner beat businessman and retired Army Ranger Paul Mango 44-37 in the GOP primary to take on Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, while attorney Laura Ellsworth finished with 19.

Wagner had the state party endorsement and a big spending edge over Mango, so it wasn't a surprise he prevailed. The contest between the two was exceptionally bitter, though. One Mango ad accused Wagner of being a ""slum lord"" and a ""deadbeat dad,"" while Wagner's daughter countered by calling Mango ""not half the man my father is"" in a spot for the state senator. But unlike some other defeated GOP primary candidates, Mango encouraged his party to come together and beat their common Democratic foe.

The battle between Wolf and Wagner will likely be another pricey and nasty fight, but the governor starts as the clear favorite. Most polls show Wolf with a positive approval rating, and that's usually enough for an incumbent to win in a friendly political year. Wagner is also a hardcore conservative who has a volcanic temper (back in June he aggressively tried to grab a Democratic tracker's phone, bloodying the tracker in the process; state Attorney General Josh Shapiro declined to bring charges), which could contrast badly with the more low-key Wolf.

â— ID-01: Former state Sen. Russ Fulcher, who had the support of outgoing Rep. Raul Labrador, decisively beat attorney and longtime Idaho politician David Leroy 43-16 in the GOP primary for this 64-25 Trump seat in the western half of the state.

Fulcher lost a 2014 primary challenge to Gov. Butch Otter by a surprisingly close 51-44 margin, and he planned to run for governor again before deferring to Labrador. While Fulcher and Leroy each spent about $110,000 during the pre-primary period, the anti-tax Club for Growth dropped a hefty $512,000 on ads for Fulcher.

â— PA-01: Wealthy lawyer and philanthropist Scott Wallace defeated Navy veteran and JAG attorney Rachel Reddick 56-35 in the Democratic primary to take on freshman Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick. Wallace (a grandson of Henry Wallace, who was Franklin Roosevelt's second vice president and ran for president in 1948 under the banner of the left-wing Progressive Party) had backing of much of the local party establishment in Bucks County, which makes up the vast majority of this seat, while Reddick had the national groups VoteVets and EMILY's List on her side.

This suburban Philadelphia seat narrowly backed both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and the GOP usually does well down the ballot in this area. The morning after the primary, the DCCC released a survey from their in-house polling operation showing Fitzpatrick with a 48-46 edge over Wallace. The poll was taken days before the primary.

Both candidates will be well-funded. Fitzpatrick had a $1.3 million war chest in early May, while Wallace has already self-funded $2.5 million. However, it's not going to be easy to beat the incumbent. Fitzpatrick, who fended off an underfunded conservative primary challenge from attorney Dean Malik 67-33, has cultivated a moderate image in his one term. Fitzpatrick is also the younger brother of Mike Fitzpatrick, a popular former congressman who retired in 2016.

Fitzpatrick's team has also wasted no time trying to portray Wallace, who was born and raised in Bucks County but spent decades away, as a carpetbagger. Wallace had a good response to that when he announced his campaign in January, declaring, ""I live in the very same house where I was born and raised and I'm proud of it,"" and adding, ""My children's height marks are notched on the wall right next to the ones for myself and my siblings.""

â— PA-02: Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle won renomination 64-36 against minister and former bank executive Michele Lawrence in this reliably blue Philadelphia seat. Redistricting split Boyle's old seat, which was numbered the 13th District, and he only represents about half of this new seat. But while a number of Democrats made noises about challenging him, Lawrence was the only one who stepped up in the end.

â— PA-03: Freshman Rep. Dwight Evans won renomination to this safely blue Philadelphia seat by a lopsided 81-19 against Pastor Kevin Johnson.

â— PA-04: State Rep. Madeleine Dean won the Democratic primary for this new Montgomery County-based seat in a 73-16 landslide against gun safety activist Shira Goodman. Former Rep. Joe Hoeffel, who decided to wage a last-minute campaign to try to return to the House after 14 years, took just 11 percent. Dean had the support of much of the state and local party establishment, but it was still a surprise that her victory was this lopsided. This district went for Clinton 58-38, and Dean should have no trouble in November.

â— PA-05: Attorney and former local school board member Mary Gay Scanlon won the expensive and very crowded Democratic primary for this Delaware County-based seat by a surprisingly strong 28-15 margin against former federal prosecutor Ashley Lunkenheimer; former Philadelphia Deputy Mayor Rich Lazer, who had the support of a number of unions as well as Bernie Sanders, also took 15 percent. Clinton won 63-34 here, and Scanlon should be in no danger in the general election.

All three top finishers had plenty of money behind them. While Scanlon narrowly outspent Lunkenheimer heading into the final weeks of the campaign, a super PAC financed by Lunkenheimer's mother deployed about $100,000 on her behalf. Lazer also benefited from about $1 million in spending from a labor-funded super PAC.

It wasn't at all obvious for most of the race that Scanlon would emerge from the very packed field as the nominee, and we even initially left her out of our write-up after filing closed. But Scanlon did have some important local figures behind her, including former Gov. Ed Rendell, which seemed to have helped her stand out. Scanlon also took more support than Lunkenheimer when the Delaware County Democratic met to consider an endorsement, and while she didn't have enough votes to win the party's formal backing, it was a sign that many local activists were behind her.

â— PA-07: Both parties hosted very tight races for this open Lehigh Valley seat, which went from 53-46 Obama to 49-48 Clinton. On the Democratic side, former Allentown Solicitor Susan Wild beat Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli 33-30, while Pastor Greg Edwards took 26. Lehigh County Commissioner Marty Nothstein, who won a gold medal in cycling at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, edged former Lehigh Commissioner Dean Browning 50.5-49.5 in the GOP primary. The NRCC added Nothstein to the first rung of their Young Guns candidate program in the final week of the race, so they likely were relieved he came out on top.

While the GOP race was largely a quiet affair, the Democratic contest was anything but. Morganelli is a self-described ""pro-life"" Democrat who gave GOP Sen. Pat Toomey some useful help during the tight 2016 Senate race and praised Trump repeatedly, putting him far outside the Democratic mainstream. But Morganelli has always performed well in his large Northampton base, and with Edwards and Wild splitting the liberal non-Morganelli vote, he came very close to victory on Tuesday. He also had some labor support, and he benefited from outside spending from a group called United Together that's tied to the awful No Labels.

However, progressive organizations also spent to stop Morganelli. EMILY's List, which supported Wild, aired ads supporting her and going after Morganelli, while Tom Steyer's NextGen America also spent against the district attorney. In the end, it was enough to get Wild over the top; while Morganelli used his concession speech to bemoan the direction he believed the Democratic Party was moving in, he did praise Wild and say she'd be a good candidate.

Outside groups largely stayed out of the GOP race. Neither Republican spent much money, especially compared to the Democratic contenders, but Nothstein did outspend Browning by a clear $124,000 to $55,000 during the lead up to Election Day. Between that and Browning's poor electoral history, it was a surprise that Nothstein won by so little. Still, both parties are likely to converge on this competitive seat in the fall.

â— PA-08: Wealthy former JP Morgan managing director John Chrin beat former federal prosecutor Joe Peters 48-35 to win the GOP nomination to take on Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright. This Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area seat swung from 55-43 Obama to 53-44 Trump, and Cartwright could be vulnerable even in a good Democratic year. Chrin has already poured over $1 million of his money into his campaign, so he can probably sustain a campaign even if national Republicans take their money elsewhere.

However, Chrin's weak ties to the area could hold him back in the fall. Chrin kicked off his bid against Cartwright last year while still living in the extremely wealthy community of Short Hills, which just so happens to be in New Jersey. And while Chrin grew up in Northampton County, his childhood home is located in the neighboring 7th District.

â— PA-09: Former state Revenue Secretary Dan Meuser decisively beat Schuylkill County Commissioner George Halcovage 53-24 in the GOP primary for this 65-31 Trump seat, which includes coal country northwest of the Philadelphia area. Meuser, who narrowly lost a 2008 primary to take on then-Democratic Rep. Chris Carney, used his personal money and connections to start airing ads early, while neither Halcovage nor former CIA officer Scott Uehlinger had much money available.

This is a very red seat, but Democrats do have a noteworthy nominee. Denny Wolff, a dairy farmer who served as the state's agriculture secretary from 2003 to 2009, has been doing some self-funding, and he had $185,000 in the bank at the beginning of May. Still, it would be a big surprise if this race is competitive in the fall.

â— PA-10: Retired Army Lt. Col. George Scott, who now serves as a Lutheran pastor, beat former Obama administration staffer Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson 36-35 in the Democratic primary to face GOP Rep. Scott Perry; public health scientist Eric Ding was a distant third with 18 percent. This seat, which includes Harrisburg and York, went from 53-46 Romney to 52-43 Trump, and Perry could be a Democratic target. Still, it's unclear if the party will invest much energy here.

So far, Scott's fundraising has not been very good. While Corbin-Johnson had EMILY's List's endorsement and raised a surprisingly strong $163,000 during the first quarter of 2018, Scott had little support and had only raised in a total of $90,000 through early May (he also loaned his campaign an additional $20,000).

However, Scott may have gained ground with an ad that we'd missed until now. Scott stood outside with an assault rifle and told the audience that he'd been trained to use weapons like it, but bemoaned that, ""Donald Trump's loyal soldiers like Scott Perry exploit guns and God to score political points."" Scott then threw his rifle into a fire as he described himself as a veteran and a pastor who believed in common sense, not blind loyalty, before concluding with a call for gun safety.

â— PA-11: Freshman Rep. Lloyd Smucker won his GOP primary rematch with wealthy businessman Chet Beiler, who just happens to be his second cousin, by a 59-41 margin; Smucker defeated Beiler by a smaller 54-46 in 2016 for what was an open seat (it was numbered the 16th District back then). While Beiler outspent the incumbent, he didn't seem to have a convincing argument for why primary voters should oust him. This Lancaster County-based seat went for Trump 61-35 and no Democrat has ever won a House seat based in Lancaster County, though nonprofit director Jess King had a notable $211,000 war chest in early May.

â— PA-12: Rep. Tom Marino beat Bradford County Commissioner Doug McLinko 67-33 to win renomination to this safely red rural northeastern seat.

Marino had tried to exit the House last year when he was nominated to serve as Donald Trump's drug czar. Marino withdrew his name after a devastating report in the Washington Post about legislation he'd pushed through Congress at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry to deliberately hobble the DEA's ability to crack down on the black market flood of prescription narcotics. However, Marino seemed secure at home, and the underfunded McLinko was the only person who ended up challenging him in the GOP primary.

â— PA-13: Dermatologist John Joyce defeated state Sen. John Eichelberger 22-20 in the very crowded GOP primary for this safely red seat along the Maryland border; state Rep. Stephen Bloom was close behind with 18, while retired Col. Vincent Mastriano and businessman and frequent candidate Art Halvorson took 16 and 15 percent, respectively. (Halvorson didn't buy just enough love with touches this time.)

Joyce used his personal wealth to outspend his opponents, but he attracted the ire of the anti-tax Club for Growth. While the Club didn't endorse anyone, it did air ads attacking Joyce for donating to Democrats. House Freedom Action, which is allied with the far-right Freedom Caucus, ran a spot praising Bloom. But Joyce did get some air support from a mysterious group called CLA, Inc. that was on the opposite side of the Club in another primary this cycle, and their help may have made all the difference in this very tight race.

â— PA-14: State Sen. Guy Reschenthaler beat state Rep. Rick Saccone 55-45 in the GOP primary for this open 63-34 Trump seat in Western Pennsylvania. The good news for Saccone is that at least this time, he won't need to read article after article about how he and his ""porn stache"" are the worst things to ever befall the Republican Party.

Saccone narrowly lost a very high-profile March special election to Democrat Conor Lamb in the old (and very red) 18th District, but he didn't take the hint and leave national politics. Reschenthaler, who had the support of Sen. Pat Toomey, made sure to run ads reminding viewers that Donald Trump reportedly called Saccone ""weak"" after his loss.

But Reschenthaler also received help from an even more infamous Pennsylvania Republican. A group called Conservatives for PA that ran ads against Saccone received most of its donations from the campaign account of former Rep. Tim Murphy, who used to represent that very same old 18th District. Murphy, of course, was that anti-abortion congressman who resigned last year after the news broke that he'd pressured the woman he was having an affair with to have an abortion when he thought she was carrying his child, and after a separate report also emerged about how he'd bullied his staff.

Murphy didn't just use his money to go after Saccone. Politico reports that he even sent around a cropped video of Saccone that he thought could hurt him: Politico writes that the candidate seemed to ""argue that taxpayers should not be on the hook for helping victims of the opioid epidemic,"" though further comments by Saccone suggest he was only framing this idea as a question someone might ask.

Murphy sent the video around in a text with the comment, ""Disturbing comments in light of the death rate in Westmoreland, [Pa.] from drug overdoses. Rick is basically saying, 'I'm not going to help you! Get your grandparents to cure addiction!"" But Murphy accidently sent that video to Saccone, and the two engaged in a nasty argument by text. Murphy insisted in an interview the day before the primary that his involvement wasn't personal, and he was just trying to stop Saccone from costing the GOP another seat. Well â€¦ mission accomplished?

3TKXBROM5USZ7CG9ECPEOBS8JIHIJL,"Unwanted by Australia, refugees on Nauru have few options","next

prev

Surrounded by the shelves and furniture her older brother made, 13-year-old Parnian sits in the small, neat living room where she spends much of her time, recalling the day two years ago she watched family friend Omid set himself alight.

""It was just down there,"" she says, motioning toward a patch of dusty earth in front of a couple of shipping containers on this hot, rocky part of the island that locals call Topside. ""And then the man was on fire. And he was just screaming.""

Omid, 23, was airlifted from the Nibok refugee settlement, where Parnian lives, to a hospital in Australia, where he died two days later. He had timed his protest against Australia using Nauru as a holding station for more than 600 refugees to coincide with a visit by U.N. refugee agency officials.

Australia designed its policy of keeping boat refugees and asylum seekers far from its shores to deter more of them from trying to make the voyage, but many critics say it violates human rights.

Parnian has been stuck on this tiny island for nearly five years now. She spends her days sleeping and watching movies, avoiding the local schools where refugees are often bullied.

She holds little hope of ever leaving. Some of her friends from Myanmar were accepted by the U.S., but her family is among the many Iranian Christians on Nauru who say the U.S. won't take them under its current immigration policies.

Like many of the refugees, Parnian did not want her full name used or her face shown in a photograph for fear of reprisals. She is one of about 120 refugee children and teenagers living on Nauru. In confronting interviews, several of the young refugees described how they often talk with each other about the desperate measures they're considering taking.

""A lot of them are doing hunger strike now,"" says another refugee, Mohammad, 17. ""They're not eating anything. They're not drinking. Their hope is to get out of here. If they don't get out of here, they hope to get out of their life.""

A series of Australian court cases has described how some of the refugee children on Nauru have been evacuated because they are suffering from resignation syndrome, a medical condition in which they withdraw socially and stop eating and drinking. Nauru's government claims the children have been manipulated into self-harm by their families and activists in a bid to get to Australia and make headlines.

Not all the refugees feel so helpless. They aren't restricted in their movements on this island of 21 square kilometers (8 square miles) and many work in local businesses. And Nauruans are proud of their country. Before dawn, residents are up and sweeping the streets and sidewalks.

The notion that some refugees could feel so unhappy about life on Nauru does not seem to sit well with its leader, President Baron Waqa.

""They're living with us. They're living among us,"" Waqa said. ""They're running their lives normally, just like any other Nauruans. They're provided all the services that are available to the Nauruans. And, you know, we live together very happily.""

Waqa was this week put in the unusual position of facing questions about the refugees from journalists, because the nation of 11,000 people was hosting the Pacific Islands Forum, a meeting of regional leaders.

For years, Nauru had effectively kept journalists away by charging a fee of 8,000 Australian dollars ($5,750) to apply for media visas. Nauru waived the fee for the forum, but allowed only a handful of journalists into the country and placed restrictions on them.

One New Zealand journalist was detained by police for three hours after she was spotted talking to a refugee. And Waqa, whose nation's economy relies on the revenue that Australia provides for housing the refugees, did not seem in a mood to invite journalists back.

""The Pacific is doing a lot of good things. That's probably why (President Donald) Trump is not listening to us, because you people are not supporting us,"" he told media at a press conference. ""You'd rather talk about the issues and refugees and things that only interest you, but not the Pacific.""

Helia, 15, a refugee who lives near her friend Parnian at the Nibok settlement, says Nauru feels like a jail. She says it's hard to even consider what a normal life might be like.

""I'd like go to school and after school come back home, go out with my friends, hang out, go to the movies. I don't know,"" she says. ""There's nothing, literally nothing, here. It's not even safe.""

Some of the refugees see some hope in moving to New Zealand, after it made an offer to Australia to take 150 refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea. But so far Australia has refused, saying that if the refugees gain citizenship in New Zealand, they could use that as a way to move to Australia thanks to the two countries free-movement policy.

Before New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern arrived at the forum, she said she wanted to hear the concerns of refugees. And Mohammad said he wanted to give her a message.

""What was my and the other children's guilt?"" he said. ""We were innocent. It was not our fault to come out of our countries. It was not our fault to be in Nauru. We need future. We need education. We need to be in a normal place.""

After Ardern arrived, Waqa picked up a guitar and, along with a group of elders, serenaded her with a song he'd written himself. Included was a verse about Ardern's 11-week-old baby Neve: ""Her future is bright and secure.""

About the same time, Mohammad sent a text to a reporter. He'd heard that Ardern had arrived. Could he meet with her and tell her of the plight of the refugee children?

""Please tell me if you think there is a way,"" he wrote. Told it wouldn't be possible, Mohammad responded: ""Oh,"" he wrote. ""OK.""",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/09/07/unwanted-by-australia-refugees-on-nauru-have-few-options.html,"['Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['3', '5', '5', '1', '3']"
3QMELQS6Y6T0CG4LKGPYTZOUKMCR6G,Donald Trump Says British People 'Like Him A Lot' Ahead Of First UK Visit,"Donald Trump has said that British people like him a lot because of his views on immigration, ahead of his first official visit to the UK.

Speaking at a surprise press conference following a Nato summit in Brussels, he said he thought the UK voted for Brexit because of immigration, and said he â€œpartiallyâ€ won an election on the issue.

Trump, who is due in to land in the UK at lunchtime on Thursday to large-scale protests across the capital, which are expected to be the biggest staged in opposition to a sitting US president, was asked about the planned demonstrations.

He said: â€œItâ€™s fine. They like me a lot in the UK. I think they agree with me on immigration.â€ He added: â€œI think thatâ€™s why Brexit happened.â€

Asked about Theresa Mayâ€™s plan for Brexit, he said the government seems to be turning back towards the EU, and that he didnâ€™t think thatâ€™s what people voted for.

He then echoed the British Prime Ministerâ€™s own words, that â€œBrexit should mean Brexitâ€.

He said: â€œThe people voted to break it up so I would imagine thatâ€™s what they would do, but maybe theyâ€™re taking a different route â€“ I donâ€™t know if that is what they voted for.â€

He added it seemed as if the UK was â€œgetting at least partially involved back with the European Unionâ€.

â€œIâ€™d like to see them be able to work it out so it could go quickly,â€ he said.

He also told reporters he was going through â€œa pretty hot spot right now with a lot of resignationsâ€ and said that out of the Nato summit, his UK visit and his meeting with Vladimir Putin on Monday, the latter may be the easiest one of them all.

The US president is due to fly straight from the summit to Stansted airport for the four day visit, which will include a black tie dinner at Blenheim Palace, talks with May at Chequers and afternoon tea with the Queen.

He will largely be avoiding London, where a mass demonstration is planned and where the â€˜Trump Babyâ€™ balloon will be flown above Westminster.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/07/12/donald-trump-says-british-people-like-him-a-lot-ahead-of-first-uk-visit_a_23480910/,"['Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Republican', 'Neutral']","['1', '2', '1', '4', '4']"
3HEADTGN2QALR6JMLOX65R4T1AFRV9,Lessons Democrats and Trump supporters should learn from Tuesdayâ€™s primaries,"The strong performance in Tuesdayâ€™s special election in Ohioâ€™s 12th Congressional District by Republican state Sen. Troy Balderson against Democrat Danny Oâ€™Connor shows President Trump made the difference. Voters in the central Ohio district sent a message: the Trump agenda is leading America in the right direction and they donâ€™t want to turn back.

President Trump, Balderson and the Republican National Committee all claimed victory for Balderson. However, news organizations are saying the race is too close to call because of provisional and absentee ballots that wonâ€™t be looked at until Aug. 18.

Anti-Trump media set the stage for a big Democratic upset in the Ohio race. But the Trump economy is booming and the presidentâ€™s dedication to keeping the House in Republican control worked to Baldersonâ€™s advantage.

Balderson was ahead of Oâ€™Connor by a razor-thin margin of 1,745 votes before the examination of all absentee and provisional ballots. This shows that talk of a blue wave sweeping Democrats to victories over GOP candidates is clearly premature.

Democrats are finding out that strong economic numbers like 4.1 percent annualized economic growth, 3.9 percent unemployment, and 3.4 million jobs created on President Trumpâ€™s watch will make success in November harder than expected for the left.

Furthermore, President Trumpâ€™s warning about Republican complacency paid off and Buckeye State voters responded.

So with 89 days until the midterm elections Nov. 6, itâ€™s a fitting time to do a reset about where things stand. First and foremost, letâ€™s make one thing perfectly clear. President Trumpâ€™s name may not be on the ballot come Election Day, but his agenda is on it.

President Trump is a political force of nature like weâ€™ve never seen and 2018 is a national election â€“ like it or not. The Trump economy is on the ballot; Trump immigration policy is on the ballot; the Trump foreign policy is on the ballot; and impeachment is absolutely on the ballot.

The Trump coalition must recognize this and use it to motivate our forces on Election Day. Every Democratâ€™s name on the ballot this fall is the name of a supporter of the harmful agenda of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.

The Pelosi-Schumer agenda calls for tax hikes, open borders, sanctuary cities, impeachment and more of the failed Washington status quo. And every Republicanâ€™s name on the ballot stands for the Trump agenda of tax relief, job creation, border security and reforming Washington. Thatâ€™s the stark reality of where we are as a country.

Itâ€™s become clichÃ© to say so, but this is â€“ once again â€“ the most important election of our lifetimes. The battle lines have been drawn and make no mistake, America is at the crossroads.

The Democratic base is an angry mob of Trump haters who not only want to defeat this outstanding president and his agenda at the ballot box, but want to remove him from office by any means necessary.

Reasonable Americans must decide if they want to change course to go down a road that is littered with chaos, socialism and multimillion-dollar taxpayer-funded political investigations â€“ or if they want to continue on our current path of economic prosperity, national security and standing up for law and order. You canâ€™t have it both ways.

A Democratic-controlled House of Representatives will grind the Trump economic agenda to a halt. Pelosi and company will spend all their time and energy on their Russia conspiracy hoax in cahoots with their allies in the biased mainstream media. Because of this, our economy will undoubtedly suffer.

When the legislative, executive, and judicial branches are all mired in phony investigations, the American people lose. These are the facts and that is what the Democrats want.

Americans can rest assured that they have a clear choice on Election Day about what kind of America they want to live in and raise their children in. The question for Republicans is how do they match this crazed anti-Trump Democratic intensity at the ballot box?

The answer rests with President Trump. He must continue to take his accomplishments directly to the American people and educate them on the choice they face on Election Day. We must let Trump be Trump.

President Trump will campaign all across the country with the same ferocity that he made famous in 2016. He must inspire his coalition of Republicans, independents, and Reagan-Trump Democrats to vote like its 2020.

The president, along with Republican candidates for the Senate and House, must all be singing loudly and beautifully out of the same hymn book. The message is simple. Vote like your paycheck depends on it. Vote like our national sovereignty depends on it. Vote like your constitutional freedoms depend on it. Vote like the rule of law depends on it.

3VDVA3ILIEXEG4UAYZJ5ZZJ6AZJG13,Second lawsuit filed on behalf of another Brazilian mom,"Just days after a federal judge ordered the release of a Brazilian boy from a Chicago-area shelter, immigration lawyers from Boston filed a second lawsuit asking the same court to free yet another Brazilian boy.

The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago on Monday on behalf of Sirley Silveira Paixao, 30, and asks for the release of her 10-year-old son, Diego, to his mother.

Paixao and her son arrived in the U.S. from Brazil on May 22, seeking asylum, and were separated shortly after. She was released on June 13 and has been living in Massachusetts. The boy was taken to the Chicago area, and to the same shelter where Diogo De Olivera Filho was held before a judge ordered his release last Thursday.

Jesse Bless, an attorney for both boys' mothers, had hoped Diogo's release would prompt authorities to also hand over Paixao's son without a lawsuit, but authorities declined.

The second lawsuit, much like the first, makes the claim that Diego cannot be held on grounds of being an ""unaccompanied minor"" because he was with his mother when he entered the country.

The lawsuit, which claims that detaining the boy is unconstitutional, also states that Paixao has filled out all appropriate paperwork and submitted fingerprints. The lawsuit also said federal authorities have deemed Paixao's claim of facing danger in Brazil â€” her reason for seeking asylum for herself and her son â€” as credible.

Bless said he is hoping for a hearing later this week but that it could be delayed by the July Fourth holiday.",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/07/02/second-lawsuit-filed-on-behalf-another-brazilian-mom.html,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['3', '4', '5', '5', '1']"
302OLP89D0PXTGR5SWGFK9RUGDCACE,"Amb. Ric Grenell on NATO spending commitments, EU tariff threats","This is a rush transcript from ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" July 8, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

BLAKE BURMAN, GUEST HOST: Hello. And good Sunday morning to you.

We will get back to those breaking developments out of Thailand in just a minute.

But, first, President Trump preparing for his historic Supreme Court announcement tomorrow night, as he also gets ready for what could be a tense meeting with NATO leaders and a sit-down next week with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.

Plus, the stage is set for yet another explosive hearing on Capitol Hill with the embattled FBI agent Peter Strzok, who is set to testify publicly for the very first time.

Hello, and good morning. I'm Blake Burman, in for Maria Bartiromo. And this is ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

It's just one day before President Trump announces his second Supreme Court nominee, and lawmakers are already raising concerns about some of the candidates.

I will sit down with John Malcolm, who helped put together the president's initial judicial list.

And that leaders of our NATO allies are bracing for his arrival in Brussels later this week and the president's upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin. I will get reaction to all that in an interview this morning with the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Ric Grenell.

Plus, all eyes will be on Capitol Hill Thursday, when Peter Strzok testifies publicly before the House Judiciary Committee about his anti- Trump text messages and his role in both the Clinton and Trump investigations. I will ask one committee member, Congressman Andy Biggs, what he wants to hear from Strzok, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

But, first, right out of the gate this morning, this is a Fox News Alert.

At least four boys have now been recovered from that flooded cave in Northern Thailand. Thai navy SEALs backed by an international team of divers and experts pulling off a remarkable feat here in just the last couple hours.

And this dangerous rescue mission has just begun and could last for quite some time. President Trump tweeting out his support just moments ago, writing on Twitter -- quote -- ""The U.S. is working very closely with the government of Thailand to help get all of the children out of the cave and to safety. Very brave and talented people.""

Jeff Paul is live on the ground in Mae Sai, Thailand, this morning with the breaking news.

Jeff, where does everything stand right now?

JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Blake, I'm just getting some new information into our hands, that another operation to free more boys will commence in 12 -- 10 to 12 hours.

That's according to the governor here in this province where we are; 50 foreign divers, 40 Thai divers are currently involved in that rescue operation that's been confirmed now by the governor has freed at least four of the boys.

Obviously, they are trying to get them out as quickly as possible. It's been very rainy out here, making those rescue operations only more complicated.

Yesterday, while we were out near the cave site, lots of mud out there, but certainly lots of resources, lots of people working around the clock to get these boys to safety.

Now, we do know that those boys who have been rescued are being taken to the hospital to be checked out. We do not know their condition. The governor said that he had spoken with at least one of them and said that they are in perfect -- this is a perfect situation. He didn't go into much detail about their condition.

But it sounds like they are getting the care they need right now, and more boys could be headed to safety very soon -- Blake.

BURMAN: Jeff, great to hear this morning, a story we will follow all throughout the day here. Jeff Paul from Thailand this morning, Jeff, thanks.

Meantime, the countdown is still on this morning to President Trump's Supreme Court nomination, as he prepares to name the second high court pick of his presidency. That will come tomorrow night, 9:00 p.m. here on the East Coast. Six appellate court judges are believed to be on the short list, with three, possibly maybe four candidates emerging as the top contenders.

The president also bracing for a confirmation fight, no doubt about it, that will come afterwards, with a very slim Republican majority in the Senate.

Joining me now, John Malcolm. He's the vice president of the Institute for Constitutional Government at the Heritage Foundation and a former deputy assistant attorney general. He also compiled the list of Supreme Court justice recommendations in 2016.

Seven of the eight that you compiled ended up getting on to that list. Not a bad ratio.

JOHN MALCOLM, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Yes, no, not bad at all.

BURMAN: One of them was Brett Kavanaugh, so let's start there. He's 53 years old, Yale law graduate, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. So, he's a local there, kind of on the farm team for the Supreme Court.

But there are also concerns from some that he is not conservative enough and that he has ties to the W. 43 Bush administration. We know what the president thinks about the Bushes in some cases.

Are the critiques that he's not conservative enough accurate?

MALCOLM: Well, I don't think so. I think the world of Brett Kavanaugh.

In addition to going Yale, he clerked for Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. He then worked for -- under Ken Starr at the Office of Inspector General. For five years, he was a senior adviser to President Bush. And he's written over 300 opinions in his 12 years on the D.C. Circuit.

He is highly regarded by judges across the country. He's a committed textualist and an originalist, cares a lot about separation of powers, is not in favor of giving undue deference to agencies. There have been a couple of opinions in which he actually ruled the way conservatives would want him to rule in terms of reaching the right outcome, but he didn't give the most pure conservative reasons for reaching that outcome.

And that's caused some criticism. But he sits on a court with a majority of Democrats, and he has to appeal to the Supreme Court too.

BURMAN: Raymond Kethledge, 51 years old, out of the Sixth Circuit, he's a University of Michigan law grad, so not necessarily in the mold of the Ivy League, of which the other eight justices are.

There was a story in The New York Times that Mitch McConnell has pointed to Kethledge as one of the two that possibly could have the easiest nomination path. Do you see it that way?

MALCOLM: Well, he hasn't attracted the kind of criticism from a few conservatives that Brett Kavanaugh has.

And he certainly has a long judicial track record. He's been on the Sixth Circuit, I think, for 10 years now, possibly a little bit longer, also clerked for Justice Kennedy. University of Michigan is a fine law school.

He also wrote a book recently about leadership that I think was well-done and attracted a lot of attention. He would also do a fine job as an associate justice.

BURMAN: Amy Coney Barrett, 46 years old, Seventh Circuit, she's only been on the federal court of appeals for -- since November, I believe, right?

So, you're talking only seven, eight months. There's some questions about whether or not her resume is long enough, a Notre Dame law graduate. Is the resume there?

MALCOLM: Well, she hasn't been a judge for very long. But she's been a very distinguished academic for a long time. She was at G.W. and then University of Virginia. And since 2002, she was at Notre Dame. She has compiled an impressive body of scholarship, was supported by scholars across the political aisle around the country during her confirmation hearing, and, of course, held up as grace under fire during her confirmation hearing.

BURMAN: And then there's also Thomas Hardiman. We are led to believe that he finished second last go-around to Neil Gorsuch.

So, help me out with this. If you finished second last time, there's an opening this time, why wouldn't Hardiman be the pick, if you are the president?

MALCOLM: Well, the calculus changes with each pick and it's a whole new ball game.

Tom Hardiman has actually been a judge the longest. He was a district court judge in 2003. And he's sat on the Third Circuit since 2006, a very distinguished judge, close, of course, to the president's sister, has written some very solid opinions on religious liberty, the Second Amendment.

So it doesn't surprise me that he's in that final list. Whether he will get the nod or not remains to be seen.

BURMAN: Democrats are rallying around Roe vs. Wade. There will be, if this nominee, whoever it is, goes through, a fifth nominee that was put on a high court by a Republican president.

Want you to take a listen here real quick to what then candidate Trump said on the trail during one of the debates. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CHRIS WALLACE, MODERATOR: Do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment. Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen. And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.

I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BURMAN: If it is one of those three, what happens to Roe do you think?

MALCOLM: Well, I think that the concerns about Roe vs. Wade being overturned any time in the near future are sort of overblown.

There's only one justice on the court, Clarence Thomas, who has called to revisit Roe. The justices move very slowly and incrementally with respect to any kind of precedent.

And, of course, with John Roberts on the court, you never know exactly which way he would go if Roe was squarely presented to the Supreme Court. And he's also the president who has also said that he's not going to have a litmus test, as have other past presidents. And I take him at his word.

BURMAN: There are some who say, I want to see a conservative woman on this court. That would be Amy Coney Barrett in this case.

Is that something -- for someone like you, who watches the court and who compiles a list, is that something, if not in necessarily this instance, something that you would like to see happen at some point down the line?

MALCOLM: Well, I don't tend to think in terms of genders and races. I look for qualities.

That having been said, I had a woman on my list, Diane Sykes. There are a number of highly qualified women on the president's list, Allison Eid, Margaret Ryan, Amy Coney Barrett, Joan Larsen. And if he picked any of them, that would be great.

BURMAN: All right. Prediction time, who do you think the president will pick?

MALCOLM: Slight nod to Brett Kavanaugh, but it could...

BURMAN: Why?

MALCOLM: Experience, dealt with a lot of second -- sits on the second most important court in the land, deals with a lot of the issues that will be -- that the administration will care about.

But Amy Barrett and Raymond Kethledge are right up behind him.

BURMAN: Why is there this whisper campaign against Kavanaugh right now?

MALCOLM: I think that everybody in Washington has their favorites. It is a little bit like a cage match where only one person emerges.

And so whisper campaigns happen to promote their candidate and try to do in the others.

BURMAN: So, you think it will be Kavanaugh.

If you had the selection, who would you choose?

MALCOLM: If I had the selection, it would be Kavanaugh. But the others would also be outstanding.

BURMAN: Thank you very much, John Malcolm. We appreciate it. You put the initial list together. It might come to fruition with the Kavanaugh pick. We will see.

MALCOLM: We will see.

BURMAN: John Malcolm, thanks again this morning.

Meantime, it's a big week ahead coming up for President Trump, as he prepares for two summits in Europe, with many of our allies, including Germany, concerned about what could come about with one of those meetings, with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.

We will have an exclusive interview with the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Ric Grenell, next.

Also, we continue to follow the developments out of Thailand, where four boys have now been rescued from that flooded cave. We just got word the next phase of the rescue operation will begin in about 10 to 12 hours from now. We will stay on top of this throughout the morning and throughout the day.

Stay ahead with us, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BURMAN: This is a FOX News Alert.

We continue to keep our eyes peeled in Thailand, Mae Sai, Thailand, the northern part of that country. The rescue operation there to save the boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave is now on pause. The next phase will begin, we are led to believe, here in about 10 to 12 hours or so, this first phase incredibly successful so far as four of those children have been rescued.

We will continue to watch the developments out of Thailand.

Meantime, it is a big week ahead on the world stage for President Trump as he prepares to leave for Europe Thursday -- Tuesday, rather, starting with the NATO summit in Brussels. That will be followed by a visit to Great Britain, where he will meet with the Prime Minister, Theresa May, and, along with first lady, Queen Elizabeth.

Then, a week from tomorrow, he has his highly anticipated summit, his sit- down face-to-face with Vladimir Putin. That will happen in Finland.

Let's bring in now the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Ric Grenell. He joins us from Berlin this morning.

Mr. Ambassador, thank you for joining us.

RICHARD GRENELL, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO GERMANY: Thanks, Blake. Thanks for having me.

BURMAN: So, there's the NATO summit coming up in Brussels. The president has talked about wanting to extract more defense spending.

Specifically, the country that you are in right now, Germany, he talks about how they only spend 1 percent of their GDP on defense. Is the president going to continue to push for that? And, more so, specifically, what exactly can he do about it, considering it is the other nations who have to up their defense spending?

GRENELL: Well, look, this is a very important issue for the readiness of NATO, for the readiness of Europe. It is a very pro-Europe position to ask countries in Europe, specifically Germany, to increase their defense spending.

This is going to create a stronger transatlantic alliance. This is very pro-Europe. And, currently, the Germans don't spend enough. As you know, they made this commitment -- it's called the Wales pledge -- back in 2014, and they made a commitment that it would take 10 years to get their defense spending up to 2 percent of their GDP by the year 2024.

Currently, there's a plan on the table to get defense spending up to 1.5 percent by 2024. And so what we are doing is urging the Germans to keep their commitment and other countries to keep their commitments to that NATO pledge, increase NATO spending by 2024.

That's the commitment that they made. And although steps have been made, more needs to be done to keep that 2 percent commitment.

BURMAN: Let's go around the world for a second, because, afterwards, the president from NATO then goes over to the U.K., as we spelled out, and then it's over to Finland to meet with Vladimir Putin.

Where you're sitting right now, in Germany, there are many who are saying that they are a bit uneasy that, after meeting with allies, the president is then going to go sit down with Vladimir Putin.

To those who have concerns in part of the world -- in the part of the world where you are right now, should they be concerned?

GRENELL: Look, I see a lot of people here in Germany that are very pleased with the United States' sanctions on Russia.

We have held the Russians and President Putin accountable for their malign activities. I think people see the facts. And it just makes sense to have a meeting and sit down to talk about issues where the president is going to be defending Americans' national security.

But make no mistake about it. We have large sanctions on Russia, and those will continue.

BURMAN: Want to talk about something that you are very close to, which is the trade imbalance with the European Union.

The president spoke to Maria Bartiromo about this eight, nine, 10 days ago.

Listen here to what he said, and I will get your reaction.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: I love those counties, Germany and all of the countries.

MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Right.

TRUMP: Scotland. You know, you have Scotland. They're still in there. They're still hanging in there, right? We will see what happens with Brexit, but they treat us very badly.

They treat us very unfairly.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BURMAN: So, the president says they treat us unfairly. The E.U. has already retaliated with tariffs.

One of the things I know you are involved with is the possibility of the president deciding, hey, we need to put a 20 percent tariff on cars.

Could be zero, if walked back. Could be 20. What is the likely scenario, as you see it right now, on car imports into the U.S. from the E.U.?

GRENELL: Look, I think the likely scenario is unknown.

But the facts are that we inherited a broken trade policy. It's -- it's just not fair. I think the president is exactly right, and I'm pleased that he's focused on it.

Just take the car situation, the car tariffs. The facts are, Blake, that the E.U. puts 10 percent tariffs on us. And we have a 2.5 percent tariff on them when it comes to autos. So, of course they want to continue this process. They want the status quo.

But the president has been committed. He, in the campaign, committed to defend Americans' interests. And the auto industry is one of those. So, what we're trying to do is create some momentum. We're talking to the government of Germany and the auto industry in Germany to try to see if there's a path forward for zero percent tariffs.

We don't know if there is. But what we're trying to do is get the facts, talk to the industry, talk to the German government, which, obviously, this issue is all about the E.U. But what we're trying to do here in Berlin is create some momentum, create some good news that could surround this E.U. trade deal.

And we think that the car industries are a huge part of this. I'm working very closely with Secretary Ross and those at the White House, Peter Navarro and others, to try to make sure that we get as much information from these industries to see if we can create a little momentum for the E.U. trade deal.

BURMAN: So, a TBD, I take it.

Let's move on to Iran, because the U.S. government had said, as they stepped away from the nuclear deal, hey, to all the businesses in Europe, you shouldn't be doing business with Iran. And I know this is something that you are in the middle of right now, trying to get businesses not to work with Iran, but to try to get them to pull back and to do business with the U.S.

What are the incentives right now for these companies in Germany to do this?

GRENELL: Look, to be honest, it is an easy sell.

When I talk to CEOs of large companies, they say, you know, there really isn't a difference between the U.S. market or the Iranian market. And, again, they get to choose. They can either choose to do business in Iran, or they can choose to do business with the United States.

But we have made it clear that you're not going to be able to do both. And so what I hear from large companies is, is that it's a no-brainer. They are immediately choosing the United States and are walking that back within the time frame that they have been given.

What we're trying to do in Berlin, though, is talk to the medium-sized and the small companies in Germany that are doing business in Iran. What we'd like to do is give them an incentive, give them a new market, like the United States' market, get them to turn away automatically.

The small and medium-sized companies, just it makes sense that it is more difficult for them to turn away if they have contracts. And so what we're trying to do is aggressively reach out to these companies to say, hey, what we would like to do is help you have access to a larger market in the United States. What -- what can we do to help?

And we're getting a pretty good response.

BURMAN: A lot going on, on that side of the Atlantic. And in the middle of it is all the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Ric Grenell.

Mr. Grenell, thank you for joining us this morning. We appreciate it.

And coming up: the FBI official Peter Strzok returning to Capitol Hill on Thursday. He will speak publicly at a joint House committee hearing.

Congressman Andy Biggs is one of the lawmakers who will pose questions to him. He will join me next, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BURMAN: Welcome back.

The embattled FBI agent Peter Strzok heading back to Capitol Hill this week. He will testify Thursday, and do so in an open hearing at the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees following his 11-hour closed-door session with lawmakers last week.

Joining me now is Congressman Andy Biggs, who serves on the Judiciary Committee.

Congressman, thank you for joining us this morning.

REP. ANDY BIGGS (R), ARIZONA: Thanks for having me. Good to be with you.

BURMAN: So, Peter Strzok testified behind closed doors, did so for an incredible amount of time, 10, 11 hours, I believe.

What do you hope to learn from him this time around out in the opening -- out in the open, considering you have already heard from him behind closed doors?

BIGGS: Well, don't forget that, while he was sitting behind closed doors, he had two attorneys kind of filtering questions and answers. So, there's a lot left to get too.

And I think we're going to still go back and talk about this -- the biases, how he conducted the investigation.

Don't forget, he was the -- the I.G. said he was the lead investigator on the Hillary Clinton investigation. He was the lead investigator on the Russia collusion. And then somehow he ended up on Mueller investigation. So, there's still a lot of bone on that -- a lot of meat on that bone regarding the bias and whether he actually was enacting some of that bias in his investigations.

BURMAN: Peter Strzok's attorney has said there is a transcript. Before Peter Strzok testifies, release it out to the open, so everyone can see it.

What's wrong with that?

BIGGS: Well, I don't really have a problem with that, but I think you are talking -- and his attorney knows this.

If you have ever done a deposition or worked with courts, getting a transcript done and getting it done right takes time, because, I mean, he was there for 11 hours. So it's a lengthy transcript.

He gets to go through it and say, well, wait a second, that wasn't quite right, typically, before it gets released publicly.

BURMAN: There is another investigation. Speaking of documents, the DOJ document request that yourself and others on the Hill have been calling for, saying you want more documents, they did produce more documents.

Are you satisfied with where things stand right now?

BIGGS: No, I'm completely dissatisfied.

I'm glad that they are finally dribbling them through. But just think about this. We have some requests that have been out almost a year now that they haven't fully responded to.

But, you know, they are getting some out, but I think the public, just like me, are fed up. They want the documents. Let's get them. Quit dribbling them out. Let us see them. So, I'm glad they are giving us some, but I'm for action.

If they are not going to give them to us, then we need to take the next steps. We can't just beg them anymore.

BURMAN: Help me bridge the gap, though. If you want those documents quickly, but you say the transcript needs time. It sounds like, if you want everything quickly, shouldn't the Strzok transcript be out there too?

BIGGS: Well, the Strzok transcript will be out there in a timely fashion, I think.

But -- but don't forget, like I say, some of these requests that we have made by subpoena to DOJ have been out there for almost a year now. That's a long time. That's longer than a week. So...

BURMAN: All right, let me ask you about a different investigation out there, and that is the one into the president.

The president's -- one of his top attorneys, Rudy Giuliani, saying in an interview with The New York Times over the weekend that basically there's two conditions that he is setting forth for the president to sit down with Robert Mueller, one, that there is evidence that the president committed a crime, and,two, that it would be essential to ending the investigation.

Here's what Rudy Giuliani told the New York Times. He said -- quote -- ""If they can come to us and show us the basis, and that it is legitimate, and that they have uncovered something, we can go from there and assess their objectivity.""

Do you think that's a smart -- a smart play there from Mr. Giuliani and the president's legal team?

BIGGS: Well, it may be a good P.R. move. I think it is a bad legal move myself.

I mean, the authority that's out there is only if the president is -- you know, if he's committed a crime, then the remedy is impeachment, and then, once out of office, then you can proceed with the criminal investigation and conclusion to that.

I don't think he should sit down. I don't think that this is going to be objective in any way. I think it's been skewed from the start. I mean, the fact -- just take a look at the Mueller investigative team. They won't even give us all the names of two people, but we know the people that are on there have been revealed to be highly biased against this president, which, to me, indicates that maybe the investigation itself is tainted.

And I wouldn't -- I wouldn't subject the president to that interview.

BURMAN: Congressman, sit there right there, if you can, for a minute. I want to get your thoughts on immigration. I know you have been to the southern border recently, and to -- your thoughts as well on one of your colleagues there in the House Freedom Caucus.

So, stay there with us.

Meantime, we continue to watch what is happening out in Thailand in the northern part of that country.

Stay -- stay with us, and we will be right back here on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BURMAN: Fox News alert, we continue to watch the rescue operation in Thailand to save several boys from -- and their coach from that flooded cave.

The rescue mission right now is on pause, the next phase will begin in about 10 to 12 hours from now. However this first phase of at least the rescue part of getting children out, which has happened this morning has been incredibly successful because four boys have been pulled from that cave to safety.

That means there are currently eight more children and their soccer coach in that save. We will continue to watch this throughout the show and the morning. Meantime, we are back now with Congressman Andy Biggs who serves on the Judiciary Committee.

Congressman, thank you for -- for sticking with us here. I know you were on the southern border recently. Curious for your thoughts as to what exactly you saw there and then there's these reunification deadlines to put children back with their families under five years old by Tuesday, older than five, everyone else at that point, by July 16th.

Do you think that's obtainable?

REP. ANDY BIGGS, R-ARIZONA: I think it's going to be very hard to -- to meet that goal and also we need to see where -- where are you going to put these folks? Are you going to keep them in a federal -- basically federal housing and -- and -- and where are they going to be located and are you reunifying the families into a tough situation and -- and there's a lot going on.

A lot of arm chair quarterbacking going on, but I think that the deadlines that are there are really difficult to -- to fulfill.

BURMAN: What happens if they're not met, the deadlines?

BIGGS: They can issue some sanctions, but the reality is they're going to have to -- to -- to recognize that -- that it's kind of an unrealistic goal if you will. And so I think that the -- the federal government's going to continue to try to reunite these families, but it's -- it's going to take a while.

It's going to take a little bit of time.

BURMAN: I want to ask you now about ICE because there has been this push from Democrats to abolish ICE. Jeh Johnson who is the head of the Department of Homeland Security in the last term for President Obama came out in an op-ed just a couple days ago saying we should not abolish ICE, instead we should essentially reform it.

And here's what he wrote, I want to write -- read some of it to you. He said, quote, ""if Americans don't like ICE's current enforcement policies, the public should demand a change in those policies, or a change in the leaders who promulgate those policies. During the Vietnam War, millions of Americans demanded an end to the war.

No one seriously demanded we abolish the entire Defense Department. Obviously that would have completely compromised national security. Do you agree with the former head of the Department of Homeland Security there?

Obviously you don't think ICE should be abolished, but would you be willing to look at possibly reforming it to -- to make the institution better in its current state?

BIGGS: Well certainly you can make some reforms, and I agree with him on that. But -- but understand that -- that Jeh Johnson and -- and many people who -- who are on that side on the issue opposite of where I am, they -- they want -- they want to perpetuate the catch and release.

And so when I see people that actually promulgated the catch and release under Mr. Johnson, under his predecessor Janet Napolitano, the -- they're now serving as supervisory positions even under this administration.

So you still have catch and release, and that's -- that's one of the big incentives for people to come to this country illegally and to make statements asserting that they're (ph) asylum and refugee status.

And so they know they're going to be released into the interior, and that's a problem. So some reforms have to be made, but they aren't necessarily the ones that he might want to see.

BURMAN: And finally, Congressman, one of your members of the House Freedom Caucus, Jim Jordan, there are more allegations out this morning from members of the Ohio State wrestling team that during their days they say Congressman Jordan was aware of sexual abuse against some of those student athletes.

And a story in the Washington Post, others have come out and said Jim Jordan would not have known such a thing. The congressman denies knowing any of this. The allegations, though, do continue to mount one after the next.

Do you stand by Mr. Jordan and do you think that he should continue to potentially pursue the speakership of the House?

BIGGS: Yes, I stand -- I stand with Jim, I'm all in (ph) with Jim all the way. I've talked with him, I believe him when he says he didn't know, and I will just tell you that some of the allegations are coming out well he should have known or he must've known.

And that tells me a lot more about the accused than the -- about the accuser rather than the accused, because those are just conclusory (ph) statements saying oh well I knew something so why didn't he know or he should have known.

And I just don't -- I don't buy into that, and I think that the timing suspect as well and I think Jim is a man of integrity and honor and I'm -- I -- I'm with him all the way.

BURMAN: Congressman Andy Biggs out of Arizona, we will see what happens with Congressman Jordan, but we appreciate you joining us this morning. Thank you very much, sir.

BIGGS: Thanks for having me, appreciate it.

BURMAN: In the meantime, the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, fresh off two days of talks in North Korea, claiming progress despite some alarming allegations, accusations rather from the Kim regime, calling the negotiations, quote, ""deeply regrettable"", and saying the U.S. is making, quote, ""gangster-like demands on the north"".

Let's bring in a former governor of New Mexico, Bill Richardson, he's also a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and former secretary of energy under the Clinton administration and someone who knows this issue deeply. Thank you for joining us this morning.

BILL RICHARDSON, FORMER GOVERNOR, NEW MEXICO: Thank you, Blake.

BURMAN: So help me walk through the timeline here, because the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after the meetings came out and said they were productive. The North Koreans then after Pompeo made those comments said they were regrettable.

And then there was a Pompeo press conference in the overnight hours and he said the North Koreans know exactly what is on the table. Listen to the secretary of state here.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE, TRUMP ADMINISTRATION: There's no difference, but most importantly is what the North Koreans understand. We had lengthy discussions about the scope of what complete denuclearization means over the past two days.

They acknowledge that this is broad, this is -- as my two colleagues have said, from weapons systems to missile (ph) material to the production facilities, enrichment facilities across the range of weapons and missiles.

It's a broad definition of denuclearization, the North Koreans understand that and have not challenged that. Second, they also understand that denuclearization makes no sense absent (ph) verification.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

What's going on here? Is this just negotiating tactics from the north?

RICHARDSON: This is typical negotiating tactics from the north. I've negotiated with them before, they bob and weave, they delay, then they lance this bellicose rhetoric gangster-like stuff.

But there's still the problem here is that there's significant gaps in what we want on denuclearization, missiles and what the North Koreans are prepared to do.

(CROSS TALK)

BURMAN: -- if they're significant?

RICHARDSON: Yes, I think they can be bridged, but it's going to take years. It's not going to be instantaneous. And I think Secretary Pompeo, I'm going to give him some credit, you know, he's had three visits to North Korea.

He's two out of three, in baseball parlance. The first two to set up the summit, were good, but this one, I -- I don't think turned out well because of the difference that we have in terms of what each side wants to achieve. And the North Koreans, you know, they -- I think we made the mistake like going first and saying we're going to stop some of the military exercises with South Korea.

The North Koreans always want you to go first and then when it's their turn, Blake, they should have accounted for all their inventory of missiles, of nuclear activities, they should have given us some kind of deadlines timelines on when they're going to destroy or find ways to curb the use, verification, which is the most important issue.

I think these were discussed but not much agreement. Now, even the MIA, the remains of our soldiers, they said they were going to hand over 200. They haven't done that. Well, there's a meeting in July 16. I've dealt with them on that issue, the North Koreans. They want payment for that. You know, so there's just a lot of gaps.

But I think Secretary Pompeo needs to continue this effort. The president needs to back him up but the president has got to stop saying mission accomplished. It's not. It hasn't even started. So I think here's a case where we've got to be patient, we've got to push forward. It's going to be tough, the North Koreans will be playing games throughout but it's worth pursuing because tensions have lessened in the peninsula.

BURMAN: Governor, stay right there. We want to get to this and more with you when we come right back. I also want to ask you about the highly anticipated meeting between the president and Vladimir Putin one week from tomorrow as we look ahead on Sunday Morning Futures. Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BURMAN: Welcome back now. We are with the Former Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson once again. He's also a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, former secretary of energy under the Clinton administration and a North Korea expert. Governor, thanks again for sticking with us. You had mentioned that you thought Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, was two for three in his visits to North Korea.

That would get you into the hall of fame in baseball, but some critics would say this was a pretty big strikeout in the sense that he did not meet face to face with Kim Jong-un himself this time. Why do you think Kim Jong-un made the decision not to meet with the secretary of state when he traveled over there to North Korea?

RICHARDSON: Well, he was sending a message. I don't think it's a devastating message but he was saying look, now it's up to my secretary of state, your secretary of state, our technical people, our nuclear people. But it was a little bit of a jab. And -- and I think this is what we have to understand. On the positive side, they did say the North Koreans, they still trusted the United States, President Trump, the results of the summit.

But I can tell you from negotiating with the North Koreans, they're going to continue being difficult, shifty. Their -- their existence depends, Blake, on keeping some nuclear weapons. They have about 60. But our objective and the world's objective should be to curb their use, to have some stringent -- stringent efforts to stop proliferation, to freeze some of those weapons, to find verification methods.

I mean, we have to continue this effort. But it's going to take time. It's not going to take one year. It could, maybe, over two years, significant efforts can be made. But you know, we've got to be patient. We've got to give Pompeo that flexibility to continue these efforts to push hard and -- and see where we end up.

The status quo right now is -- is really not a good option. Because there's enormous tension in the peninsula, we've got troops in South Korea and Japan, we've got our allies Japan and South Korea right now, their populations are very vulnerable. And the United States too. Some of their missiles could hit our country or Guam or Alaska. So this is worth pursuing.

BURMAN: Real briefly, there is another summit that is coming up one week from tomorrow. President Trump set to meet with Vladimir Putin in Finland. The president was critical of the media coverage earlier this week during his rally in Montana and he said this and I want to get your reaction on the other side. Watch.

We -- we don't have that. But the president essentially said that Vladimir Putin, he's going to be prepared and he said -- the president said that he will be prepared. And he characterized Vladimir Putin as someone who is fine. We have it now. Watch now.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Really be prepared. Really be prepared. And I might even end up having a good relationship but they're going will President Trump be prepared. You know, President Putin is KGB and this and that. You know what? Putin's fine. We're all fine. We're people.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BURMAN: Real briefly, is that the right message to send heading into this?

RICHARDSON: No, that's not the right message, especially saying he's fine. Now, I don't have a problem with the president meeting with Putin. I know he's been criticized for that. What I worry about is the content of the meeting. And my worry is this, Blake, that the president is going to make it a rosy summit like he did with Kim Jong-un and say maybe I'm going to take sanctions off. I'm glad the ambassador said he wouldn't.

I think the president has to stick with our NATO allies. They're worried about NATO. They're worried about Putin. And -- and we have to say to Putin look, you can't meddle in U.S. elections anymore. Secondly, you've got to be sensible on Crimea. You've got to be sensible on Ukraine.

You've got to stop meddling in Syria, helping Assad. I mean, we've got a whole range of issues where if we work together, I think the situation worldwide, security-wise will improve. But I worry that the president goes into these summits, maybe not listening to his advisors, and -- and -- and gives away part of the store. And I'm really worried about the sanctions.

We've got to keep those sanctions on Russia or Russia is going to take full advantage of us as they have been, in my judgment.

BURMAN: Governor Bill Richardson, we have a Supreme Court pick coming up, a NATO trip, a meeting with the prime minister of the U.K. and then this. What a 10 days coming up. Thank you for joining us. We appreciate it.

RICHARDSON: Thank you.

BURMAN: Meantime, President Trump, as I said, making a primetime announcement tomorrow night on his choice to replace the Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. The panel is standing by for the politics of the Supreme Court pick in a midterm year. Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BURMAN: Welcome back. As you probably know by now, the president will announce his nominee to replace the retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy in a prime time address tomorrow night, which, of course, you can watch right here on the Fox News Channel.

Let's bring in our panel. Ed Rollins is a former campaign manager for President Reagan, and James Freeman is the assistant editor at The Wall Street Journal editorial page, both Fox News contributors. Thank you for joining us this morning.

What a Sunday, huh?

ED ROLLINS, FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR RONALD REAGAN: A lot of action to talk about.

BURMAN: Do you guys have a -- I mean, we ran through the candidates. You know the top three at this point. Do you have any reservations of any of them?

ROLLINS: No. I think these are superb choice. I was on presidential selection on the Reagan administration. These are all conservatives. Every single one basically has a great record. If I had a choice, which obviously I don't, I think Judge Barrett would be an extraordinary future candidate -- but I mean, a good judge. And I think she would send a very loud message as a good conservative woman.

BURMAN: Does Kavanaugh worry you at all?

JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: A little bit. I would echo what Ed said in terms it is a great list. You are talking about very accomplished, bright, qualified -- eminently qualified people, but there is a little bit of a concern about Kavanaugh, maybe a little too much in the Roberts mold of caring a lot what Beltway establishment thinks of him, possibly could be pressured toward the political consensus rather than the correct legal reasoning.

BURMAN: Roe versus Wade, the Democrats are bringing up as the issue, whoever the president puts up there, Democrats are going to fight it no matter what. They are going to try to tie this Roe versus Wade no matter what.

For that reason alone, do you think the president should just lock in on this and maybe nominate Barrett?

ROLLINS: Well, I would nominate Barrett no matter what, whether it's -- any judge that gets appointed basically would be if they had a choice would probably vote to overturn it, but that's not going to probably happen. They are going to basically limit abortion and let the states see what comes before them.

But she's attractive, articulate, woman candidate. We have never appointed a conservative. Sandra Day O'Connor was Reagan's appointment, but she didn't turn out to be conservative -- right on must issues, but not all issues. I think this one would be a great, great judge.

FREEMAN: Yeah, I mean, she's really got it all in terms of you are talking about formidable intellectual star who else, I think to Ed's point, would play very well politically.

The rising attack from the media seems to be that she's into some kind of weird cult, because she likes to gather for barbecues with Christians and maybe do some community service.

I think most of the country is going to look at her as a very welcome impressive addition to the court.

BURMAN: Do you worry at all that Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, maybe Shelly Moore Capito, whoever the pick is, that they might be an issue for the Republicans on this to get them on board?

ROLLINS: If the three women -- two of them certainly will be supportive -- if the three women basically go against her for some reason, we're not going to win. But at the end of the day, I don't think they will. I think at the end of the day, she's a very persuasive, articulate candidate who has a very strong record, and I think it is a detriment to...

BURMAN: But I'm just saying in general do you think those three...

FREEMAN: I would say she's qualified. I mean maybe there's a concern about Collins, but I think you look at the record, very hard to say there's a problem here unless you're a single issue politician, trying to sort of impose your views on the law.

I think the problem is really on the Democratic side, where in these 10 Trump states where Democratic incumbents are seeking reelection, whether it's Heidi Heitkamp, North Dakota, John Tester, Montana, Joe Donnelly in Indiana where Professor Barrett is located, these are tough votes against her. So I think it's probably more of a problem for Democrats.

BURMAN: I've got 10 seconds. Give me a last name, who the president picks.

ROLLINS: I think he picks her.

FREEMAN: Yeah, let's go with Barrett.

BURMAN: We will see. And we'll find out Monday night. Thank you very much for both of you. Appreciate it.

Meantime, that does it this morning for ""Sunday Morning Futures."" I'm Blake Burman, in for Maria Bartiromo. She is back next weekend, by the way, and you can watch both of us during the week on the Fox Business Network. We will see you bright and early tomorrow morning. ""MediaBuzz"" with Howard Kurtz is up next after this quick break.

3B9XR6P1WFDPK42382XX2OOVO6TJB1,Yuma Sector Busts Child Rapist for Illegal Re-Entry,"Border Patrol agents in the Yuma Sector arrested a Mexican national who has been deported on numerous occasions. It is at least the 2nd time this year the convicted child-rapist has been arrested in the Yuma Sector after being deported.

Yuma Sector agents patrolling in the area of Andrade, California, arrested a Mexican national, 55-year-old Hector Gutierrez-Perez, after he illegally crossed the border with another man. A records check at the station revealed the man has a lengthy history of criminal convictions, including the rape of a minor under the age of 14, and immigration violations, according to information provided to Breitbart Texas by Yuma Sector Border Patrol officials.

Border Patrol agents previously arrested Gutierrez-Perez in March for illegal re-entry after removal as a sex offender and convicted felon, Breitbart Texas reported at the time.

Law enforcement database records stated that Gutierrez-Perez had previous felony convictions in Bakersfield and Santa Cruz, California. Those convictions include â€œunlawful sexual intercourse with a minor,â€ obstructing a public officer, and battery.

His criminal history goes further with convictions for drug possession, transporting/selling narcotics, hit and run, and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, CBP officials stated.

Gutierrez-Perez was traveling with a 33-year-old man from Honduras who is also expected to be removed from the U.S.

Court records obtained by Breitbart Texas show that following the March arrest of the previously deported Mexican national, Gutierrez-Perez pleaded guilty to illegal re-entry after removal. The charge carried a Class C enhancement that could have provided a sentence of up to 10 years in federal prison.

Under a plea bargain agreement, the dangerous criminal alien received a sentence of 4 months in prison on June 25. He also received 3 years of probation. He received credit for time served and sometime after June 25, Gutierrez-Perez was again deported from the U.S.

In addition to the rape of a minor under the age of 14 and Gutierrez-Perezâ€™s other felony convictions, the Mexican national also has a long history of deportations. His first deportation occurred following an order of removal in October 1990. He was removed again on March 16, 2018, and then re-entered the U.S. near San Luis, Arizona, on March 19.

Border Patrol agents said that Gutierrez-Perez said he was traveling to North Hollywood, California, where he planned to live and work.

Gutierrez-Perez could now face additional felony charges for illegal re-entry for removal with sentencing enhancements for his previous felony convictions and removals. He could also face a probation revocation from his June 2018 immigration violation conviction.",https://www.breitbart.com/texas/2018/08/04/yuma-sector-busts-child-rapist-for-illegal-re-entry-2nd-time-since-march/#disqus_thread,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Republican', 'Neutral', 'Republican']","['1', '5', '4', '5', '5']"

The controversial olive green anorak, which originally retailed for $39 and has since sold out, is currently receiving hefty bids on the online marketplace, The Washington Post reports. As of Friday morning, two â€œpre-ownedâ€ versions of the â€œauthenticâ€ jacket were bidding at $895 and $660.

Both sellers report that they bought the jacket in Zara stores a few years ago.

CLOTHING COMPANY FACES BACKLASH AFTER PULLING 'BOYS WILL BE BOYS' SHIRT

On June 21, Trump sparked outcry as she sported the â€œI really donâ€™t care, do u?â€ jacket en route to visiting detained migrant children at the Texas border amid a mounting immigration crisis.

In response to the incident in the days since, fashion brand Wildfang sold out of a charitable 'I really care' jacket and teen star Jenna Ortega wore a bespoke military jacket reading â€œI do care and u should tooâ€ to the Radio Disney Music Awards on June 22.

Meanwhile, FLOTUSâ€™ office denies that the controversial coat had any political meaning in the first place.

""It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe. (Much like her high heels last year),"" Stephanie Grisham, White House Director of Communications for FLOTUS, told Fox News.

Surrounded by a handful of friends, Lopez pretended to pee on President Trumpâ€™s Hollywood Star in Los Angeles Tuesday evening by placing a water bottle near his crotch and pouring the contents onto the plaque while grimacing.

The 57-year-old made headlines in June for selling a jacket with messages that read â€œkeep the kidsâ€ but â€œdeport the racistâ€ in protest of the Trump administrationâ€™s â€œzero toleranceâ€ immigration policy.

The proceeds from the coat, inspired by first lady Melania Trumpâ€™s Zara jacket with the slogan â€œI really donâ€™t care, do u?â€ allegedly went go to far-left advocacy groups fighting for the rights of illegal aliens in the U.S.

â€œMy George Lopez Store will be making these items, money donated to organizations focused on reuniting parents and their children,â€ the comedian wrote on Instagram, featuring a photo of himself with comedian D.L. Hughley donning the jackets.

Before the 2016 presidential election, Lopez said he believed the real estate billionaire had a real chance of winning the White House. â€œThereâ€™s enough racists in this country for him to get elected,â€ he told TMZ. Lopez was asked after Trump beat Hillary Clinton whether he would reconsider his hate for the president-elect: â€œIâ€™ll give him a chance to suck my ass,â€ the comedian said dismissively.

That same year, Lopez made headlines for sharing a violent illustration depicting Mexican druglord JoaquÃ­n â€œEl Chapoâ€ GuzmÃ¡n holding the head of a decapitated Trump. The meme was captioned: â€œMake America Great Again!â€

3PA41K45VOMY432BQYQ1UIOBEOL7PY,ICE Arrested A Mom And Her Son In A Courthouse After A Domestic Violence Hearing,"US Immigration officials arrested a woman and her 16-year-old son in a North Carolina courthouse as they were leaving a hearing connected to a domestic violence dispute, a move immigration activists have called an intimidation tactic that could have chilling ramifications for the local criminal justice system.

The woman, a mother of two from Colombia named Maria, is embroiled in a bitter domestic violence dispute with her ex-fiancÃ©. She is currently fighting misdemeanor larceny charges filed against her by her ex-partner. Her attorneys have called the charges a ""bogus"" retaliation brought about in response to her ending the relationship.

On July 9, Maria and her son had just finished meeting with a judge at the Mecklenburg County Courthouse in Charlotte and were heading to the elevators, when they were approached by two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents dressed in plain clothes, the agency confirmed to BuzzFeed News on Saturday.

""I was filled with so much panic, fear, confusion, and I didn't understand what was happening at that moment,"" Maria, speaking through a translator, told a group of activists and demonstrators gathered at a park in Charlotte on Friday.

Though ICE has identified Maria by her full name, BuzzFeed News is only using her first name at her lawyers' request.

The arrest sent ripples of shock and outrage through the area, and highlighted ICE's increasingly aggressive efforts to prosecute those in the country illegally. The immigration agency has not detained an undocumented immigrant in a local county courthouse in more than a decade, according to Becca O'Neill, an attorney with the Charlotte Center for Legal Advocacy who is working on the case.

""I've never seen anything like it before,"" Mecklenburg Assistant Public Defender Herman Little, who witnessed the arrests, told the Charlotte Observer. ""How in the world is anybody going to get justice if both the victims and the defendants are not going to come to court because they're all afraid of being deported? This is crazy.""

Maria came to the US legally from Colombia in January 2016 on a fiancÃ© visa, but the visa expired in November of that year after she called off the marriage because of abuse, according to legal advocates.

""She became a victim very early on and decided to finally leave [him] in January when the physical abuse reached a new level,"" Stefania Arteaga, a community organizer with Comunidad Colectiva, told BuzzFeed News. ""Her son also became a victim and suffered two black eyes and a bloody nose.""

A judge had recently granted Maria a protective order against her ex-partner for beating her son, O'Neill said. Jail records show that the ex-partner was arrested in January on a domestic violence charge.

Last month, Maria moved her two children, including her teenage son and a two-year whom she had with her ex, into a domestic-violence shelter. In what her lawyers' described as a retaliatory move, the man then filed a misdemeanor larceny complaint against her, accusing her of stealing their young child's belongings when she left him.

According to O'Neill, the charges prompted ICE's involvement in the case. Following the misdemeanor complaint, immigration officials filed charging documents against Maria in June for remaining in the country illegally after her visa expired. And a few weeks later, agents tracked her down in the courthouse.

""They were definitely tipped off and we think it was by her ex,"" he said. ""This woman had never been booked or fingerprinted so she was not in any systems.""

While ICE would not divulge how the agency learned Maria would be in the building that day, spokesperson Bryan Cox explained that the agency has ""access to a variety of databases, which we check and work with local law enforcement.""

""We remain focused on criminal offenders and safety threats, so when criminal charges were filed against her it triggered our involvement,"" Cox told BuzzFeed News, adding that Maria's case could still result in a positive outcome for her and her teenage son.

""She had no priors and there are a lot of factors here and we just now have to wait and see how this plays out with an immigration judge,"" Cox said.

Still, Maria's attorneys and several community groups, have pointed to the arrest as alarming evidence of ICE flexing its muscles, and sweeping up vulnerable populations -- including children and domestic violence victims -- as part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on people living in the US illegally.

""ICE wasn't good before but they had priorities on who they were targeting,"" O'Neill said. ""Now they consider everyone, kids, parents, a priority to deport. It feels like they are making examples of people and it's terrifying.""",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/briannasacks/ice-arrested-a-mom-and-her-son-in-a-courthouse-after-a,"['Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['5', '5', '5', '3', '5']"
304QEQWKZQ221SQQQZSDQ39YW5J0OA,Jon Kyl to replace John McCain: 3 things to know about the former Arizona senator,"Former Arizona senator Jon Kyl was tapped to replace Sen. John McCain, who recently lost his battle to an aggressive form of brain cancer.

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey announced the news Tuesday, writing on Twitter that he is â€œdeeply grateful to Senator Kyl for agreeing to succeed his friend and colleague of so many years.â€

Kyl will serve as a placeholder and is not expected to run in 2020 â€” the year voters will decide who will fill McCainâ€™s seat for the following two years. After that, the seat will be open for a full six-year term.

McCain's widow, Cindy, tweeted: ""Jon Kyl is a dear friend of mine and John's. It's a great tribute to John that he is prepared to go back into public service to help the state of Arizona.""

ARIZONA PRIMARIES FOCUS ON EDUCATION, IMMIGRATION: RACES TO WATCH

Kyl was a longtime Republican senator in Arizona, serving from 1995 to 2012 before retiring from Congress in 2013. He left as the second highest-ranking Republican senator.

Kyl, a longtime friend and colleague of McCain, wrote in The Weekly Standard following McCainâ€™s death that the former Vietnam war hero â€œfaced his inevitable end with courage and grace.â€

In light of the news, here are three things to know about Kyl.

Heâ€™s a practicing attorney

After retiring from Congress in 2013, Kyl, 76, joined the law firm Covington &amp; Burling as part of its â€œexpansion of its public policy and government affairs practice,â€ Politico reported that same year.

According to his biography on the firmâ€™s website, Kyl â€œadvises companies on domestic and international policies that influence U.S. and multinational businesses and assists corporate clients on tax, health care, defense, national security and intellectual property matters among others.â€

The same year he joined the firm, he told Politico he received â€œseveral offersâ€ but â€œhad [his] eye on Covington from day one.â€

""I think McCain would be very happy with the pick. Honors his legacy while putting some major horsepower for Arizona in the seat, at least for now."" - Doug Cole, long-time Republican consultant and former McCain aide

â€œI had a serious law practice, and with the experience I gained in Congress, I think I have acquired the knowledge and judgment to help clients that reflects my legal training and experience in Congress,â€ he told the publication.

Rather recently, in March, Kyl was one of the leading attorneys from the firm who helped scrap Broadcom Limitedâ€™s hostile takeover of Qualcomm, Inc. The firm secured the deal after Trump blocked the proposed acquisition, citing national security reasons, the firm said in a statement.

Republicans are hopeful that heâ€™ll vote along party lines

Unlike McCain â€” who opposed a partial repeal of former President Obamaâ€™s health care law before he died, for example â€” Republicans are hopeful Kyl will be a â€œreliable partisan vote,â€ The Associated Press reported.

""I think McCain would be very happy with the pick. Honors his legacy while putting some major horsepower for Arizona in the seat, at least for now,"" Doug Cole, a longtime Republican consultant and former McCain aide, told The Associated Press.

Heâ€™s serving as Brett Kavanaughâ€™s â€œsherpaâ€

In July, the former senator agreed to serve as President Trumpâ€™s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaughâ€™s â€œsherpaâ€ during his confirmation process.

TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT PICK NEEDS SENATE APPROVAL: A LOOK AT THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS

As â€œsherpa,â€ or escort, Kyl â€œwill be tasked with shepherding Trumpâ€™s pick through the Senate, much in the same way former New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte helped to pave a path for Justice Neil Gorsuch last year,â€ The National Law Journal previously reported.

This isnâ€™t the first time Kyl has served in this role.

3K3G488TR3Q4HBP72IQTW30PSEBQ5S,Black men are more likely to die at hands of police and more,"News and opinion gathered from outlets across the country by Policing the USA.

Here are the top things you may have missed about policing this week:

Police three times more likely to kill black men

If you're a black man, you are three times more likely to be killed by police than a white man, according to a recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health. The study looked at all male homicides reported in the last six years. Eight percent of them were police killings. And of the 6,300 total male homicides, nearly 1,800 of them were black men.

What's more is that this issue is prevalent across the country. There's not a single place in the U.S. where the risk of a black man getting killed by police is less than double that of a white man.

Video shows officer restraining child

After a Facebook video of a white police officer forcefully restraining a black boy went viral, the Georgia Police Department released the officer's body camera video to provide context in the midst of racial bias accusations.

The officers were arresting a domestic violence suspect when the man's 10-year-old son began screaming and crying. The boy lunged at one of the officers, causing them to land on the patrol car, according to the police statement. The officer then pinned the boy to the ground. Once the boy calmed down, the officer let him up and allowed him to see his father in the back of the cop car. The incident is currently under investigation.

Teen flees bike ticket, gets hit by cop car

A 16-year-old boy in Sacramento was running from a bicycle violation when he was hit by a patrol car Sunday night.

Police attempted to stop the boy for lighting violations on his bike, but he ran off. The officers chased after him and called for backup, and one of the additional police cars struck the boy. He was cited for resisting arrest but didn't suffer any life-threatening injuries. His family said they plan to take legal action. A woman claims she was also hit by the cop car during the collision, but police have not yet confirmed this second incident.

A win for immigrants

Immigrants living in Orlando, Florida, without legal permission no longer need to worry about being deported if they talk to the city's police force.

Orlando commissioners voted on Monday to stop police officers from asking about the immigration status of ""law-abiding"" citizens. Crime victims and witnesses, as well as low-level traffic offenders, need not worry about speaking to the police. Commissioner Tony Ortiz, who contributed to the resolution's success, explained that this was not ""sanctuary city"" legislation, but one that allows immigrants of good character to live in the country peacefully.

Police officer forced out for racial slur

A Kentucky police department took disciplinary action after one of its officers called a black teen a""wild animal that needs to be put down"" in a Facebook post.

Former officer Brian Smith was investigated by the Louisville Police Department after an attorney complained that Smith's Facebook account displayed ""deep-seated bias against minority communities."" Chief Steven Conrad planned to fire Smith in January due to his Facebook posts, but ultimately decided to suspend him for 30 days without pay. Smith resigned from the department in April.

3J9L0X0VDG4S2VN5HH2G08ND2XBW91,Russia indictments undercut Trump's denials,"Donald Trump has often scoffed at the notion that Russia was behind the hacking of a Democratic National Committee server. On Friday afternoon, his ridicule was again proved to be unfounded.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officials in connection with the hack of the Democratic National Committee's computer server and subsequent leaking of emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, the latest charges in special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing probe into Moscow's meddling in the 2016 election.

All 12 of the defendants worked for the GRU, the main military foreign-intelligence service of the Russian Federation.

According to the charges released Friday, the defendants accessed the email accounts of volunteers and employees of the Clinton campaign, including Chairman John Podesta, beginning in March 2016. ""They also hacked into the computer networks of a congressional campaign committee and a national political committee,"" Rosenstein said. ""The defendants covertly monitored the computers, implanted hundreds of files containing malicious computer code, and stole emails and other documents.""

The Russian operatives ""created fictitious online personas,"" including ""DCLeaks"" and ""Guccifer 2.0,"" Rosenstein said, adding that the group falsely claimed DCLeaks was started by a group of American hackers and that Guccifer 2.0 was ""a lone Romanian hacker.""

""In addition to releasing documents directly to the public,"" Rosenstein added, ""the defendants transferred stolen documents to another organization"" and ""discussed timing the release of the documents in an attempt to enhance the impact on the election.""

The organization was not named in the indictment, but it is widely speculated that the unnamed entity is WikiLeaks.

Rosenstein said he briefed Trump on the allegations earlier this week. The president, who is Europe and scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Sunday, is ""fully aware of today's actions,"" Rosenstein added.

When asked about his upcoming summit with Putin earlier Friday morning, Trump said he would raise the issue with Russian president but didn't expect a ""Perry Mason moment.""

Trump has long sought to undermine the Russia investigation, and repeatedly referred to Mueller's probe -- which has now resulted in 32 individual indictments and five guilty pleas -- as a ""witch hunt.""

During the 2016 campaign, Trump taunted Clinton and the FBI -- which had been investigating her use of a private email server -- by publicly calling on Russia to locate her emails.

""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said on July 27.

According to the indictment released Friday, Russian operatives targeted Clinton campaign emails ""for the first time"" the same day.

3QX22DUVOPZUUQ6UGG1PJSAJV1GVMH,President Enjoys Record Support from Republicans,"The latest polling shows President Trump enjoying record support from Republicans, proving once again just how little influence and moral authority Never Trump has.

A recent Gallup poll shows that 90 percent of Republicans support the president. According to the New York Times (a far-left outlet that regularly spreads fake news), other than the historic outlier of George W. Bush in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, no Republican president in this pollâ€™s history has garnered 90 percent support from Republican voters at this point in a first term.

Trumpâ€™s historic level of support from within his own Party is not only a tribute to the presidentâ€™s verifiable successes at home and abroad (tax cuts, booming economy, regulation reform, gutting Obamacare, North Korea under control, the Islamic State all but vanquished, no stupid neocon wars); it is also a testament to just how marginalized, tribal, and extreme the failed Never Trump movement has become.

While Never Trumpers, like those at the embattled National Review, the nowâ€“irrelevant Weekly Standard, and elsewhere, have been successful at spinning self-righteous onslaughts against Trump into love and attention from the establishment media, the movementâ€™s overarching goal is losing whatever residual ground it once had. And that goal, of course, is to once again influence the GOP into a Party that discriminates against law-abiding Americans in favor of cheap foreign labor, a Party that launches more failed wars, a Party that appeases the media, and a Party that is eager to destroy the working class through illegal immigration and a near-religious belief in free trade.

The reasons for Never Trumpâ€™s loss of ground with voters are obvious. To begin with, Never Trump cannot stop looking ridiculous, especially in the face of Trumpâ€™s mounting successes. Like its allies at the far-left MSNBC and CNN, Never Trump has assumed the extreme (and silly) position of refusing to acknowledge Trumpâ€™s successes, choosing, instead, to maintain the idea that Trump never does anything right.

Whatâ€™s more, Never Trumpâ€™s pious moralizing is not only off-putting and arrogant; the fact that Never Trump loves to preen its own virtue while lecturing the rest of us about â€œdecencyâ€ and â€œmorals,â€ while they cozy up to the amoral media, exposes just how craven they really are.

In other words, Never Trump is happy to do business with hysterical liars such as CNN and MSNBC, two outlets that foment violence against the political right; happy to nuzzle next to a Jake Tapper, who stood silent as his hate mob booed a rape victim â€” but Never Trumpers find the president and his supporters intolerable.

Never Trump truly exposed its amoral opportunism, though, while vocally supporting Congressman Mark Sanford (R-SC) just a few weeks ago during his failed re-election primary bid against a pro-Trump Republican. This breathtaking act of mindless tribalism unmasked Never Trump like nothing before or since.

After spending months and months working side-by-side with the media to bring down Trump over the possibility he might have had an affair with a porn star over a dozen years ago, here was Never Trump vocally tub-thumping for Sanford, a man who, just a few years ago, shirked his duty as governor to have an extra-marital affair in Buenos Aires.

No one is arguing Sanford does not deserve forgiveness or a second chance. But after writing countless columns about the importance of morality in public office, after spending countless hours on cable news earning applause from left-wing anchors for ripping into evangelicals who â€œlost their soulsâ€ standing by Trump (over a disputed affair more than a decade ago), this very same group then smugly turned around to circle the wagons for Mark â€œThe Appalachian Trailâ€ Sanford.

Never Trump has no principles â€” moral or otherwise. Its failed ideas drove George W. Bushâ€™s ratings into the 20s and delivered eight years of Barack Obama, and now, it looks as though its disapproval ratings have hit 90 percent.

39XCQ6V3KZMB7T6NN9CVQYJYS1L659,â€˜A political suicide marchâ€™: Trump aims to inflict political pain on Democrats over calls to abolish immigration enforcement agency,"President Trump on Saturday opened a new front in the immigration debate, diverting attention away from his administrationâ€™s treatment of undocumented immigrants to a broader fight over the federal agency charged with detaining and deporting them.

In a pair of tweets from his private golf club in Bedminster, N.J., Trump forcefully defended the performance of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and lambasted Democrats as pushing a â€œradical leftâ€ agenda to abolish it, even though only a handful have publicly supported doing so.

â€œTo the great and brave men and women of ICE, do not worry or lose your spirit,â€ Trump wrote in one tweet. â€œYou are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements.â€

In an interview on Fox News set to air Sunday, Trump suggested that the issue would hurt Democrats in the midterm elections because ICE helps eradicate violent gangs. Trumpâ€™s public support of ICE came as tens of thousands marched in cities across the country to protest a â€œzero toleranceâ€ policy under which all adults who crossed the border illegally were referred for criminal prosecution, resulting in more than 2,500 children being separated from adult relatives.

â€œI hope they keep thinking about it because theyâ€™re going to get beaten so badly,â€ he told Maria Bartiromo, host of â€œSunday Morning Futures.â€ â€œYou get rid of ICE, youâ€™re going to have a country that youâ€™re going to be afraid to walk out of your house. I love that issue if theyâ€™re going to actually do that.â€

Over the past week, several prominent Democrats have proposed eliminating ICE, citing what they say is its unjust treatment of immigrants. Among them were Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 28-year-old who upset Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) in a primary election Tuesday, and Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).

Though other Democrats, including party leaders in the Senate and House, have not gone that far in their criticism, the debate over ICE has thrust an agency with 20,000 employees into the public spotlight after years of whiplash over the scope of its central mission since its founding in 2003.

â€œWe need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom, starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our morality,â€ Warren said at a rally in Boston on Saturday.

[Democratic insurgents want to â€˜abolish ICE.â€™ Democrats arenâ€™t there yet.]

ICE, which is housed within the sprawling Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for arresting and deporting the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally. But the agency has been criticized by liberal activists for its tactics, including workplace raids and the deportation of undocumented immigrants whose children are U.S. citizens.

The Obama administration aimed to narrow ICEâ€™s mission by targeting its limited enforcement resources to violent criminals while seeking to provide deportation relief to others. Deportations fell from a high of 434,000 in 2013 to 344,000 in 2016 under President Barack Obama.

But Trump, who ran on a hard-line immigration platform, eased the ICE guidelines in his first week in office as his administration declared that no groups would be broadly granted exemptions to deportation laws.

The recent public outcry over the Trump administrationâ€™s policy of separating children from adults who illegally cross the border from Mexico has focused renewed attention on the treatment of immigrants at the southern border. However, it is Customs and Border Protection â€” a separate division under the DHS â€” and not ICE, that carried out the policy, sending parents to face prosecution in federal court while their children were turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Trumpâ€™s policy reversal, in the form of an executive order mandating that families not be separated, has raised new questions, over how long the administration will detain families and in what conditions.

Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s upset of Crowley, the fourth-ranking House Democrat, raised the question of whether her more liberal positions were indicative of a party shifting further to the left. Asked on CNN about her support for abolishing ICE, Gillibrand said, â€œI donâ€™t think ICE today is working as intended. I believe that it has become a deportation force.â€

Gillibrand suggested separating the agencyâ€™s functions under different divisions to â€œbuild something that actually works,â€ though she did not offer specifics.

â€œWe should protect families that need our help and thatâ€™s not what ICE is doing today,â€ she said.

Yet other Democrats fear that such a position is fraught for the party as Trump continues to paint immigrants as dangerous to put his political rivals on the defensive.

â€œI think itâ€™s a winning issue for him,â€ said Leon Fresco, an immigration lawyer who served as an aide to Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) during Congressâ€™s unsuccessful effort to pass comprehensive immigration reform in 2013-2014. â€œIf itâ€™s a binary choice and people think itâ€™s the end of immigration enforcement, thatâ€™s not a good place for us to be.â€

[Seeking a split from ICE, some agents say Trumpâ€™s immigration crackdown hurts investigations and morale]

In his tweets, Trump praised ICE for working to â€œliberateâ€ Long Island from the grasp of MS-13, a transnational gang. The president has twice visited that region to discuss the dangers of criminal immigrants, whom he has called â€œanimals.â€

â€œThe radical left Dems want you out,â€ Trump wrote in his tweet, referring to ICE. â€œNext it will be all police. Zero chance, It will never happen!â€

A senior White House official said the administration would be â€œleaning aggressively into the fightâ€ over ICE.

â€œThis is a political suicide march for the Democratic Party,â€ said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House thinking. â€œThe Democrats have literally moved the immigration debate to the terrain of: Should the country enforce our immigration laws â€” yes or no? These are thoughts once relegated to the outermost fringes of the Democratic Party. Now thereâ€™s not one Democratic leader willing to repudiate these comments.â€

One Democratic aide in the House, who was not authorized to speak on the record, called proposals to abolish ICE â€œstupidâ€ and said the strategy would â€œplay right into Trumpâ€™s hands.â€

This aide said the party should focus on â€œthe cruelty of the actions around family separations and some of the ridiculous tactics used by ICE to bully state and local governmentsâ€ to comply with federal immigration detainers.

â€œBut the â€˜abolish ICEâ€™ debate oversimplifies everything,â€ the aide said. â€œYou rarely get anywhere through policymaking by hashtag.â€

Alarmed by the rhetoric, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which has been critical of Trumpâ€™s immigration agenda, developed talking points to emphasize the â€œinhumane and harshâ€ treatment of immigrants by ICE but also stressed the importance of other functions of the agency, such as investigating cybercrime and carry out anti-drug operations, according to the Daily Beast.

Other Democratic leaders also have refrained from calling for the elimination of ICE, instead focusing on reforming the agency.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) â€œbelieves that ICE has been on the wrong end of far too many inhumane and unconstitutional practices to be allowed to continue without an immediate and fundamental overhaul,â€ said her spokesman, Drew Hammill.

John Sandweg, who served as acting ICE director in the Obama administration, said the fierce criticism of ICE risks further harming morale in an agency made up largely of employees who are trying to enforce the laws without a political agenda.

The anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks released a list of names of thousands of ICE employees, along with personal information, such as phone numbers, that was collected from public databases.

On Saturday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen named Ronald D. Vitiello to serve as acting director of ICE, after the departure of interim director Thomas Homan, who announced his resignation in the spring in the face of a stalled confirmation process in the Senate.

â€œThe men and women of ICE are doing what they are told,â€ Sandweg said. Of Democrats, he added: â€œTheir beef is not with ICE â€” itâ€™s with Donald Trump.â€",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-defends-agency-charged-with-detaining-and-deporting-undocumented-immigrants/2018/06/30/0edca6ea-7c86-11e8-93cc-6d3beccdd7a3_story.html,"['Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['5', '5', '5', '4', '4']"
3NRZ1LDP7XOHOD8H9TIKL2HAOHXPZ7,Trump backs the Georgia governor candidate who said he'd use a truck to 'round up criminal illegals',"Donald Trump tweeted out his endorsement for Secretary of State Brian Kemp on Wednesday, a move that comes less than a week before the GOP's July 24 primary runoff for governor of Georgia. There was little indication before this that Trump preferred Kemp over Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, who has the support of termed-out Gov. Nathan Deal, and Trump's tweet only offered the usual ""tough on crime, strong on the border and illegal immigration"" platitudes that he gives out to pretty much all his endorsed candidates.

However, it's possible the White House has decided that Kemp is likely to win next week, and they want to take credit for his victory. And while a recent independent poll from the University of Georgia gave Kemp only a small 44-41 lead, there's a good reason to think he had the edge even before he got Trump's help. Even though Cagle led Kemp 39-25 in the first round of the primary in May, the lieutenant governor has struggled to pick up more support despite decisively outspending his opponent. Trump may also simply prefer Kemp, who used one ad to brag about his ""big truck, just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take 'em home myself,"" to the more establishment-friendly Cagle.

On Wednesday, Kemp also earned an endorsement from Clay Tippins, who took fourth place in May with 12 percent of the vote. This move was very unsurprising, since Tippins released a recorded conversation with Cagle last month where the lieutenant governor admitted to supporting a bad bill solely to stop a super PAC from backing another candidate, former state Sen. Hunter Hill. Tippins later provided Kemp with more audio of that conversation where Cagle was heard saying that primary voters were too extreme and driven by identity politics. Earlier this week, Kemp also picked up the support of Hill, who took 18 percent of the vote.

Cagle is also out with what his campaign has labeled his closing ad, and let's just say he's not ending the extremely nasty campaign on a warm and fuzzy note. The narrator details what he says are Kemp's victims after 20 years in politics, beginning with, ""26 women sexually assaulted during massages."" The commercial does not go into any detail about this very explosive charge, but Cagle's allies recently launched a different ad (you know, that spot that resembled a 1970s softcore porn video) arguing that the secretary of state failed to revoke licenses of a business with a ""series of sexual assault complaints,"" and declaring that they and other companies like them contributed heavily to his campaign.

The spot continues by saying that Kemp's legacy also includes ""57 farmers stiffed for millions, hundreds of seniors hurt by abusive nurses, [and] 6 million Georgians exposed to identify theft."" The narrator then asks what Kemp has to say about ""20 years of failures,"" and it shows a clip from his last ad where Kemp says, ""I say merry Christmas."" The rest of the ad declares that NRA head Oliver North, Trump's state chair, and Deal support Cagle.

341H3G5YF1WE0W4XS83U61G2GVLZ0I,How volunteers drove one Guatemalan mother cross-country to reunite with the daughter taken from her at the border,"She was on the road for days, crying and praying and recounting her story to kind strangers who offered to drive and house and feed her.

Freed from an immigrant detention center in Arizona, she traveled nearly 3,000 miles to a place called New York â€” the place U.S. government officials had taken her daughter.

Juana, a Guatemalan immigrant who crossed the border at a port of entry in Arizona hoping to seek asylum, refused to stop for meals. She spent nights in the homes of well-meaning American families. Each night a different city. Each morning a different car.

Juana, whose lawyer asked that her last name be withheld for fear that identifying her could jeopardize her and her daughterâ€™s legal case, was the beneficiary of a growing legion of volunteers who have offered up their cars, homes, food and clothing to aid migrant parents separated from their children as a result of the Trump administrationâ€™s â€œzero- toleranceâ€ immigration policy.

In two weeks, this loosely organized network of citizens has helped reunite nearly a dozen separated families, in some cases connecting them with housing, lawyers and other services they may need.

They call their coalition â€œImmigrant Families Together.â€

â€œItâ€™s empowering to think how much weâ€™re getting done,â€ said Meghan Finn, a theater director and mother of two from Brooklyn who has helped lead the effort. â€œWeâ€™ve changed the course for these families and weâ€™ve connected thousands of people across the country who have stepped up to help and formed this huge community.â€

[Migrant children separated from parents, scattered across the U.S.]

The federal government is under court order to return more than 2,500 separated children to their parents by July 26. A total of 102 migrant children younger than 5 were supposed to be reunited with their relatives by Tuesday, although the government said that it could return only 38 by that deadline and that more than two dozen children were not eligible for reunification for various reasons. A Trump administration official said Wednesday night that the government expects to have reunited by Thursday morning all children age 4 and younger â€œwho are eligible under the court order for reunification with parents in the United States.â€

In most cases, the government has been releasing parents from detention and children from federal shelters, then transporting them to a meeting place to be reunited. The parents are usually given ankle monitoring devices and told they are free to go but must report back for immigration or deportation hearings.

Immigrant Families Together is trying to speed the process by identifying parents who can be freed from custody, paying their bonds if necessary, then coordinating caravans to move the parents across state lines to where their children are being held.

Their first success was Yeni Gonzalez, whose story and tearful reunion with her three children in New York made national news last week.

Juanaâ€™s journey began Friday, after an online fundraiser collected enough to post her $15,000 bond at Eloy Detention Center in Arizona and get her on her way. Unlike Gonzalez, she had already been cleared to claim her daughter. All she needed was to get to Cayuga Centers, the shelter in Harlem that also is responsible for Gonzalezâ€™s children.

As of Wednesday, three more mothers from Eloy were waiting to be picked up and taken to their children. One was headed to Georgia. Another needed to get to Texas. The third would also be making the journey to New York City.

They would spend their nights in the homes of volunteers like Bill Oâ€™Brien, a Detroit resident, who took in two Honduran fathers Tuesday night after they were reunited with their 3-year-old sons.

[Some children returned to their parents, but judge says to move faster]

Ever Reyes Mejia, 30, and another father, also in his 30s, arrived at Oâ€™Brienâ€™s home with only their children and the clothes on their backs. He gave them clothes and toys and food that was bought and donated by members of Oâ€™Brienâ€™s church and community.

Itâ€™s not just individuals. Companies like Lyft have partnered with nonprofits to offer free rides to migrant families and advocates. Cayuga Centers collected hundreds of toys from donations via an Amazon wish list.

Rosalie Lochner, a philosophy professor turned stay-at-home-mom, has spent the last week at the marble-slab table in her Detroit kitchen, cold-calling anyone she could think of to build a database of people willing to donate frequent flier miles, toys, clothes, food and more. She said sheâ€™s received more offers than she knows what to do with.

â€œI, as a citizen, feel like I am responsible for this policy and am responsible for helping in some small way to change it,â€ she said.

Juanaâ€™s journey included a total of eight drivers over five days. They took her from Arizona to New Mexico to Colorado to Nebraska to Illinois to Michigan, where she settled into a minivan driven by Mira Sussman, a mother of three from Ann Arbor.

They spent five hours Monday driving to Pittsburgh, Sussman said. She drove most of the way a few miles an hour under the speed limit â€” just in case. â€œI was terrified we would be pulled over in a regular traffic stop and they would find her and take her away again and sheâ€™d never make it to New York to see her kid,â€ Sussman said. â€œI was being so careful.â€

Juana, exhausted, crawled into the back seat of the minivan, held her Bible to her chest and slept.

She woke in Ohio, Sussman said, and talked about what she had gone through, how she and her daughter, who is 15, would carry this experience with them for the rest of their lives. She used the word trauma, which sounds the same in Spanish as it does in English. Sussman said her Spanish â€œisnâ€™t very good,â€ but she understood. â€œI told her she has so many friends across the United States now who care about her and her family and their well being,â€ Sussman said. â€œIâ€™m glad we have the opportunity to show her that there are people with morals and courage in this country, but itâ€™s just disgusting that we have to do this at all.â€

On Tuesday, after traveling from Pittsburgh to Newark, Juana got into one last car for the drive into New York City. She met her daughter at the shelter and hugged her for the first time in weeks. A volunteer sent a message to a group text that included eight of the volunteers who helped Juana get there: drivers, organizers, translators, people who offered Juana a place to spend the night.

â€œGot her,â€ it said.

The recipients responded joyfully, sending each other congratulations and emoji of big red hearts.

The letter from Archbishop Carlo Maria ViganÃ², who was recalled from his D.C. post in 2016 amid allegations that heâ€™d become embroiled in the conservative American fight against same-sex marriage, was first reported by the National Catholic Register and LifeSite News, two conservative Catholic sites.

The accusations sent a shock wave across the reeling Roman Catholic Church, but the letter offered no proof of its claims, and ViganÃ² on Sunday told The Washington Post that he wouldnâ€™t comment further, beyond confirming that he was the letterâ€™s author.

â€œSilence and prayer are the only things that are befitting,â€ he said.

The accusations came as Francis wrapped up one of the most challenged trips of his papacy, where in Ireland he came face to face with the national anger and grief caused by decades of abuse. In a Mass at Dublinâ€™s Phoenix Park, Francis spoke in Spanish and asked for forgiveness for what he called â€œabuses of power, conscience, and sexual abuse perpetrated by members with roles of responsibility in the church,â€ according to a Vatican News translation of his remarks.

â€œWe ask forgiveness for some members of the churchâ€™s hierarchy who did not take charge of these painful situations and kept quiet,â€ Francis said.

Speaking to reporters on the papal plane while returning to Rome, Francis declined to address the claims but said the letter â€œspeaks for itself.â€

â€œI read the statement this morning and, sincerely, I must say this to you and anyone interested: Read that statement attentively and make your own judgment,â€ Francis told reporters, according to the Catholic News Service.

Asked when he first learned of allegations about McCarrick, Francis declined to comment.

â€œThis is a part of the statement on McCarrick. Study it, and then Iâ€™ll speak,â€ the pope said, according to Crux, another Catholic outlet.

The reformist pontiff is divisive within the ranks of the Vatican, and ViganÃ²â€™s letter provided dramatic evidence of how rivalries are being amplified as the church struggles to deal with abuse cases in Ireland, the United States, Australia and Chile.

Some of Francisâ€™s critics, including ViganÃ², are calling for the pope to step down.

The Vatican had no comment.

The letter was the latest development stemming from a fresh wave of allegations related to clergy sex abuse and its coverup. Rumors that had swirled for decades about McCarrick exploded in June when Francis suspended the cardinal. Last month, McCarrick, facing credible allegations of abusing seminarians and minors, became the first U.S. cardinal in history to resign.

ViganÃ², 77, was the Holy Seeâ€™s apostolic nuncio, or ambassador, in Washington from 2011 until 2016. He has been a lightning rod within the Vatican who lost a power struggle in Rome under Benedict, emerged as a Francis critic and reportedly ordered the halt of an investigation into alleged sexual relations between an archbishop in Minnesota and seminarians.

Jason Berry, who has written several investigative books about the Vatican, said he believes this is the first time a pope has been accused from within.

â€œFrom within the Vatican hierarchy, from within the Roman Curia, I donâ€™t think anyone has ever publicly accused a pope of covering up for a sex abuser,â€ Berry said. â€œThatâ€™s why this is such a big deal.â€

ViganÃ²â€™s letter said that McCarÂ­rick had been privately sanctioned under Benedict â€” though only after years of warnings about his alleged behavior toward seminarians and young priests â€” not toward minors. ViganÃ² wrote that the measures, taken â€œin 2009 or 2010,â€ banned McCarrick from traveling, holding Mass or participating in public meetings.

Yet McCarrick appears to have done essentially the opposite. He regularly appeared as a speaker and celebrant at church functions and represented the church in prominent foreign diplomatic efforts in places such as China and Iran. A video from 2013 shows Benedict warmly greeting McCarrick in Rome, at the popeâ€™s resignation (and the subsequent election of the new pope), where McCarrick gave round-the-clock television interviews and stayed at a seminary.

It wasnâ€™t immediately clear why a pope taking the dramatic step of suspending a cardinal from ministry, as ViganÃ² said, wouldnâ€™t monitor McCarrick in any way.

However, when the archdiocese of New York last year began its investigation into an altar boyâ€™s allegation against McCarÂ­rick â€” the first accusation involving a youth â€” the Vatican ambassador Archbishop Christophe Pierre told McCarrick to be less public while the probe was underway, a person familiar with McCarÂ­rick said Sunday. McCarÂ­rick nonetheless still appeared in public as he wished, the person said, including attending an ordination ceremony in May in his cardinalâ€™s garb.

ViganÃ²â€™s letter says that in 2013, he met Francis and told the new pope face to face that there was â€œa dossier this thickâ€ about McCarrick. He says he then told Francis about Benedictâ€™s order that McCarrick remove himself from public life.

â€œHe corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance,â€ ViganÃ² says he told Francis. â€œThe Pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face, as if he had already known the matter for some time, and he immediately changed the subject.â€

Barry Coburn, McCarrickâ€™s lawyer, said in a statement: â€œThese are serious allegations. Archbishop McCarrick, like any other person, has a right to due process. He looks forward to invoking that right at the appropriate time.â€

He declined to elaborate further.

It was not possible to reach Benedict or his representatives. Francis has not commented previously about what he was told about McCarrick, and Vatican spokesman Greg Burke did not respond Sunday to requests seeking comment.

In the divided American Catholic Church, Francisâ€™s comments and teachings about everything from immigration and global warming to the death penalty are frequently adopted or rebuffed along partisan lines.

The ViganÃ² document uses American culture-war lingo, such as â€œright-wingâ€ and â€œleft-wing,â€ and concludes the letter by blaming â€œhomosexual networksâ€ for sexual abuse and corruption.

Conservative American Catholics who have suspected Francis of surreptitiously opening the door for liberalizing changes around sex and marriage have in recent years focused on the increased acceptance of LGBT people. Common targets for right-wing blogs such as LifeSite and Church Militant are bishops and cardinals they deem too moderate or liberal. Constantly on this list is D.C.â€™s Donald Wuerl, Chicagoâ€™s BlasÃ© Cupich and Joseph Tobin of Newark. All are named by ViganÃ² as being linked by â€œwickedness.â€

In a statement provided by the Archdiocese of Chicago, Cupich corrected details laid out by ViganÃ² about the sequencing of two events in Cupichâ€™s career.

â€œAs for the rest of the â€˜testimony,â€™ a thorough vetting of the former nuncioâ€™s many claims is required before any assessment of their credibility can be made,â€ Cupich wrote.

In the letter, ViganÃ² described several figures who could corroborate parts of his account. Those people could not be reached Sunday.

Before moving to the District, ViganÃ² spent time as a delegate within the Secretary of Stateâ€™s office, working with the Vaticanâ€™s embassies around the world.

â€œI can imagine ViganÃ² wanted to unburden his conscience,â€ said Marcello Pera, a retired professor who knows ViganÃ², co-authored a book with Benedict and has spoken critically about the direction of the church under Francis.

â€œThe author is a reliable person who has suffered because of events,â€ Pera said. â€œHis warnings were not listened to.â€

ViganÃ² was sent to Washington â€” reportedly as punishment â€” in 2011 and was there until May 2016. He arranged a controversial meeting between Francis and an American woman, Kim Davis, who had lost her job as a municipal clerk for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-gender couples. Allies of Francis alleged that ViganÃ² had set up the pope and that Francis didnâ€™t intend to affirm Davisâ€™s cause.

The letter also includes an allegation against Wuerl, D.C.â€™s current archbishop and McCarrickâ€™s successor. He is a close ally of Francis and is already under scrutiny following a grand jury report in Pennsylvania about clerical child sex abuse and an alleged coverup. Wuerl for years led the diocese of Pittsburgh.

ViganÃ² is vague in the allegation against Wuerl. The letter says â€œobviouslyâ€ Wuerl knew about Benedictâ€™s restrictions on McCarÂ­rick because the then-ambassador, Pietro Sambi, was â€œresponsible, loyal and directâ€ and must have told him. ViganÃ² says he brought up the subject himself with Wuerl, and he writes that Wuerl â€œwas fully aware of it.â€

Wuerlâ€™s spokesman, Ed McFadden, denied the report.

â€œIn spite of what Archbishop ViganÃ²â€™s memo indicates, Cardinal Wuerl did not receive any documentation or information during his time in Washington regarding any actions taken againstâ€ McCarrick, he said Sunday.

Winnie Obike, who is running as a Republican for a seat in Marylandâ€™s House of Delegates and who has been circulating a petition demanding Wuerlâ€™s resignation over the Pennsylvania report, said Sunday that she thought ViganÃ²â€™s letter made Wuerl seem even more culpable, and Francis as well. â€œThe moral authority of Pope Francis is shattered in my mind,â€ she said.

Pitrelli reported from Moena, Italy. Boorstein reported from Washington. Julie Zauzmer in Washington contributed to this report.

37NXA7GVSUOAO8O9G40AJFVUVWQVLF,Democrats risk a backlash with hardball tactics on immigration and high court,"The Democratic Party is suddenly lurching left in ways that may be self-destructive.

And it's driven in large part by 2020 politics.

Two or three weeks ago, the Democrats were riding a wave of moral outrage and favorable media coverage. Most of the country agreed that President Trump's policy of separating families at the border was wrong and rather heartless. The White House was awash in contradictory messages and some leading conservative voices were demanding that the president stop a policy that he insisted he had no power to halt. When Trump reversed himself, it was a rare win for the Democrats, who control nothing in Washington, and for journalists and commentators who were emotionally invested in the border issue.

But then the Democrats overreached. Several senators who are all but campaigning for president started calling for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to be abolished, or replaced with something else.

We heard this from Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris. Their calculation, undoubtedly, is that the Democrats who will turn out to vote in the 2020 primaries detest not only the president but his immigration policies. This view may have been reinforced by 28-year-old Latino newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-proclaimed socialist who knocked off House Democratic leader Joe Crowley.

But the problem is that ""abolish ICE"" is exactly the kind of stance that drives away moderates and independents who want some border enforcement. It is easily caricatured as a call for open borders, and Trump hasnâ€™t hesitated to make that argument. ""You get rid of ICE, you're going to have a country that you're going to be afraid to walk out of your house,"" the president told Foxâ€™s Maria Bartiromo.

The rhetoric by these Democrats reminds me of when Ron Paul, in his crusade against oppressive taxes, would call for the elimination of the IRS.

And it takes time for politicians to explain that, well, we really just mean reform the agency into a more humane bureaucracy.

So rather than making a case against young children being separated from their parents, the Democrats have moved the debate to the existence of a border patrol agency, basically because that animates their most liberal voters.

Two other developments have put the Dems on the defensive.

Many liberal voices have defended the hounding of Trump administration officials, from Sarah Huckabee Sanders to Kirstjen Nielsen to Stephen Miller. When Maxine Waters called for continued ""harassment"" of Trump Cabinet officials, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi had to distance themselves from her rhetoric. While the Democrats can fairly retort that Trump uses rough language and tactics, do they really want to position their party as favoring personal harassment of government officials?

And the retirement of Anthony Kennedy has sparked a media debate in which liberal commentators are demanding that Democrats block any vote on any Trump nominee this year. Obviously, the Democrats say this is payback for what Mitch McConnell did in stiffing Merrick Garland in 2016. But just as obviously, by taking this stance even before Trumpâ€™s pick next week, they leave themselves open to charges of obstruction.

The Washington Post recognized these problems in a front-page story yesterday:

""Growing liberal agitation over a pivotal Supreme Court retirement and a simmering crisis about immigrant child separation have left Democratic leaders scrambling to keep the political outrage they'd counted on to fuel midterm election wins from becoming a liability for the party.""

The paper also noted that Bernie Sanders-style rhetoric, including ""costly guarantees of government jobs, free health care and free college could backfire in parts of the country where Trump won in 2016, and where Democrats will have to win in November to reclaim control of Congress.""

And that's the problem. What plays in the Bronx may be politically toxic in West Virginia and North Dakota, which are among the states where moderate Senate Democrats are trying to hang onto their seats.

A handful of presidential aspirants don't speak for the whole party. But they get outsized media attention when they embrace positions like getting rid of ICE, especially in a party that for now is shut out of power and has no natural leader.",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/03/democrats-risk-backlash-with-hardball-tactics-on-immigration-and-high-court.html,"['Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Democratic']","['4', '5', '3', '5', '1']"
3NBFJK3IOI0ZCW1B41HGBVWE3DVGOY,Brexit Pits the British Against Charlemagne 2.0,"While the UK has grown chaotic, the Gallic-shaped EU remains clever, certain, and inspired by tradition.

The news that three top officials in Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet -- including foreign minister Boris Johnson -- have resigned in protest over the proposed Brexit agreement is a clear indicator that the May government might soon fall.

According to a Sky News poll, 64 percent of Britons don't trust May to handle the Brexit negotiations. Indeed, according to the odds-making website PredictIt, as of mid-day July 10, betters saw just a 51 percent chance that she would survive until the end of the year.

In the meantime, these resignations are a bit, as the Brits might say, awkward, coming as they do on the eve of the NATO summit. That conclave is arguably the most important in years, since it will bring the NATO-phobic President Trump together with his NATO-philic ""partners.""

Yet in the UK, Brexit eclipses NATO. After all, two years ago, 17.4 million Britons voted ""yes"" in a referendum as to whether Britain should leave the European Union. Yet now, in the wake of May's fumbles -- and amidst the creepy X factor of what the Russians might have done to boost Brexit and British discord in general -- the situation is murky, to say the least. As Johnson wrote in his resignation letter, ""The dream of Brexit is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt.""

Yes, there's much doubt over Brexit -- more now than there was two years ago. In fact, the polling website WhatUKThinks finds that the ""Bremain"" side has pulled ahead in the last few months; staying in the EU now leads leaving it by five points.

Yet as we survey the uncertainty in the UK, we might pause to note the certainty in the EU. That is, the EU has played its own steady game, seeking to pull the island back to the continent. One could say that it's been this way since the French Normans conquered England way back in 1066.

The geopolitical tides have ebbed and flowed across the English Channel many times since, and yet for all that time, the French have been thinking about the English Question. Of course, for their part, the English have been thinking about the French Question. However, recent evidence suggests that the French have thought harder.

That is, over the last few decades, France, operating through the EU, has developed new strategies for tractor-beaming Albion.

Here in the U.S., the EU is often seen as some sort of woolly-headed utopian pipe dream. However, the core of the EU has always been something different -- something hard-nosed, not soft-hearted. The EU is ultimately about European greatness, in the spirit of Charles the Great, better known as Charlemagne. And he, of course, was no peacenik.

So it's revealing that the key honor for the furtherance of European unity is called the Charlemagne Prize, awarded by the city of Aachen, Germany. Since 1950, virtually every great Europhile has been an honoree, including, recently, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron.

Aachen was known as Aix-la-Chapelle back when Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor, made it the capital of his realm, encompassing most of today's France and Germany. So we can see: for all their many wars over the centuries, the French and Germans share a common origin story. The Rhine River is a kind of psychic and economic spinal cord, commanding the two nations to mutuality.

Thus the vision of a Franco-German kingdom has always been alive. The only question is, as always, who would take the lead.

In 1914 and 1939, the Germans made militaristic bids for supremacy, and we know how those ventures worked out. Since then, the Germans have learned humility, although, even now, some of the old impulses peep through. For instance, on June 13, German foreign minister Heiko Maas laid out his vision of a ""large Europe."" The German economy, Maas argued, benefits enormously from the EU -- and surely he's right about that.

However, the Charlemagne vision extends far beyond mere money. And the Germans, having learned the hard way, fully realize that they can't be seen as the architects of any ambitious political project.

Thus we come to the French, whom Maas repeatedly singled out for praise. Untainted by German guilt, they are free to use their political skills -- and German cash -- to rebuild the medieval Carolingian empire.

In fact, the French have long seen diplomatie as their special skill. As Macron's predecessor in the French presidency, FranÃ§ois Hollande, said in 2016, ""Through its diplomacy, France means to be at the center of the world.""

Indeed, there's something in the Gallic mind that turns toward the twists and turns of human nature. Many are familiar with the knowing cynicism of de La Rochefoucauld, the 17th-century Frenchman famous for the mordant epigram. Not surprisingly, much of Rochefoucauld's wry oeuvre can be applied to the diplomatic arts, viz., ""Sincerity is an openness of heart; we find it in very few people; what we usually see is only an artful dissimulation to win the confidence of others.""

A lesser known contemporary was de La Bruyere. His writings were equally cynical, although more actionable, as seen in his essay, ""The Sovereign and the State"":

A minister or a plenipotentiary is a chameleon or a Proteus; sometimes, like a practiced gambler, he hides his temper and character, either to avoid any conjectures or guesses, or to prevent any part of his secret escaping through passion or weakness; and at other times he knows how to assume any character most suited to his designs, or which is required, as it may be his interest artfully to appear to other people as they think he really is.

As we know, ideas have consequences, and it's easy to see the impact of Rochefoucauld/Bruyere-type thinking in subsequent French political triumphs.

Perhaps the greatest of French diplomats was Talleyrand. Born into the Bourbon ancien rÃ©gime, he soon found himself in the service of the Revolution, and then when that allegiance turned south he reingratiated himself with the restored Bourbon monarchy. Asked about his loyalty switches, Talleyrand responded with a shrug: ""Treason is a matter of dates.""

Talleyrand's apogee came in 1814, at the Congress of Vienna. France had just lost the Napoleonic Wars, and so at the subsequent peace conference, it seemed the French would have few, if any, cards to play. Yet Talleyrand nevertheless figured out how to divide the victory coalition. That is, he pitted the two most reactionary powers, Russia and Prussia, against the two more liberal -- or at least less reactionary -- powers, England and Austria.

Talleyrand even managed to sign a secret treaty with those latter two powers. As he wrote with relish to his new master Louis XVIII, ""The coalition is dissolved...France is no longer isolated in Europe."" As Rochefoucauld, an obvious spiritual predecessor to Talleyrand, put it in his day, ""There are no accidents so unfortunate from which skillful men will not draw some advantage.""

Later in the 19th century, the French used their finesse once again to squeeze advantage out of adversity. Having been badly defeated by the Germans in 1871, France over the next two decades lured away two German allies, Britain and Russia. Thus was created the Triple Entente that staved off French defeat in World War I.

Next, in 1945, France, having been humiliated in battle by the Nazis, nonetheless prevailed in the peace: they managed to wangle their way onto the UN Security Council. The French may never regain la gloire on the battlefield, but they can win big in the conference room.

Given all this history, we shouldn't be surprised that the EU's chief negotiator on Brexit these past two years, Michel Barnier, is French. And Barnier's godfather, of course, is Emmanuel Macron, a young man (born in 1977) with a wise old soul. In the spirit of Talleyrand, Macron has managed to keep good relations with both of the current political factions in America -- pro-Trump and anti-Trump -- even as he nurtures his power base in Europe.

Macron is, indeed, Protean: as this author has argued here at TAC, at any given moment, he is both left and right. We might consider, for instance, the hot-button issue of immigration, which now threatens to undo the EU. In one breath, sounding positively global, Macron says that the EU and Africa have a ""shared destiny."" That sounds all nice and liberal, and yet in the next breath, Macron urged Africans to stay in Africa and, for good measure, to reduce their birth rates. Indeed, one wonders whether Macron has read Jean Raspail's dystopic 1973 novel prophesying France's demographic inundation, The Camp of the Saints -- which this author wrote about for TAC back in 2005 -- even if, obviously, the French leader would never admit to such an un-PC thing.

Where does all this Gallic cleverness leave the British? And Brexit?

Just two months ago at TAC, a keen observer suggested that the the emerging solution for EU malcontents -- which is to say, many of the 28 member states -- is ""Remexit."" That's a play on ""Remain"" and ""Exit,"" in which member states stay within the Union, even as they ignore unpopular EU rules, notably on migration and refugee settlement. To be sure, this is rather a muddle-through, but then history is mostly a series of muddles.

In the meantime, Macron and the French -- and the Germans, in their reticent way -- will continue to dream their heroic dreams of Charlemagne 2.0. And why not? After all, it's a vision they've been cultivating these past 1,200 years.",http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/brexit-pits-the-british-against-charlemagne-2-0/,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['1', '1', '5', '1', '2']"

The Syrian man also had an AR-15 style rifle in his home.

A federal grand jury indicted 24-year-old Majid Al Helwani, a Syrian national living in the U.S. on a non-immigrant tourist visa, on charges of unlawfully purchasing and possessing firearms and lying on federal forms while attempting to purchase additional weapons, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials.

The indictment states that agents from ICEâ€™s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) learned from a â€œconcerned citizenâ€ in December 2017 that Al Helwani had at least one firearm in his possession. The tipster claimed the foreign national had an AR-15 style, .223 caliber rifle.

The investigation uncovered Al Helwaniâ€™s immigration status as a non-immigrant tourist. This status prohibits the foreign national from owning, purchasing, or possessing a firearm. The agents obtained a search warrant and went to the Syrianâ€™s home in an Indianapolis suburb.

When the agents approached his home, Al Helwani opened the door with a loaded 9mm pistol. A search of the home also uncovered a Sabal Arms .223 caliber rifle. The agents seized the weapons.

A further investigation revealed that Al Helwani attempted to purchase a shotgun from a gun store located in Indianapolis, officials stated. The attempted purchase allegedly occurred in October 2016. The indictment claims that Al Helwani falsely represented on the ATF form 4473 required for purchasing a firearm that he â€œhad not been admitted into the U.S. as a non-immigrant touristâ€ the indictment stated.

A qualifying question on the 4473 form asks, â€œAre you an alien who has been admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa?â€

â€œAggressively prosecuting individuals who are not lawfully permitted to purchase or possess firearms is a cornerstone of a safe society,â€ U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Indian Josh Minkler said in a written statement. â€œWe are grateful to the collaborative partners who brought this to our attention and encourage all citizens to adhere to the campaign: If you see something, say something.â€

The president-elect met with the current leader to discuss his transition to office in December, aiming to ensure an orderly transfer of power after a heated and polarizing campaign. (AP Photo/Emilio Espejel)

MEXICO CITY (AP) -- New President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador went to one of his most important meetings yet Tuesday by cruising through city traffic in a compact car with the windows down and no visible security detail, establishing a casual new style of leadership that has some expressing concerns for his safety in violence-wracked Mexico.

In place of police outriders, a half dozen television cameramen on motorcycles buzzed around Lopez Obrador's car en route to a meeting with outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto at the National Palace in the heart of Mexico City.

""The people will protect me,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters who asked about the lack of security.

He suggested journalists would also cover his back, but jokingly complained that ""I have been hit a few times by cameras"" and he asked reporters: ""Don't squash me.""

Lopez Obrador met with Pena Nieto to discuss the transition for his taking office Dec. 1, hoping to ensure an orderly transfer of power after a heated and polarizing campaign.

Mexico's Foreign Relations Department, meanwhile, said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will visit Mexico on July 13 to met with Lopez Obrador, the first high-level meeting with a leftist populist who has long denied accusations of being anti-American.

Lopez Obrador praised the Mexican team that has been leading talks under Pena Nieto to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.

""I have the impression they haven't done a bad job,"" he said, though he also wants his team to sit in on the talks.

The administration of President Donald Trump has demanded higher U.S. or regional content in key sectors like autos and a phase-out clause for the 1994 trade agreement.

Lopez Obrador also has been critical of NAFTA in the past and has suggested it include issues such as immigration.

Lopez Obrador said that he has already met with businessmen after his crushing victory in Sunday's election and that he planned a Tuesday night meeting on inviting international figures -- including Pope Francis, rights activists and the United Nations -- to help come up with a plan to solve Mexico's problem of soaring violent crime.

That violence was on many minds as television stations carried live images of Lopez Obrador weaving through Mexico City's notoriously chaotic traffic in the front passenger seat of a compact car that was at least five years old.

One television reporter on a motorcycle even interviewed Lopez Obrador briefly through the car's open window.

Lopez Obrador, 64, confirmed that he won't budge on his decision to forgo secret service protection. He said he will essentially dissolve Mexico's equivalent of the secret service back into the army, of which it is unit. He also vowed to sell off government airplanes and travel on commercial flights, where he usually goes tourist class.

""He who fights for justice has nothing to fear,"" the president-elect said. ""I do not want to have bodyguards.""

Jose Antonio Crespo, a political analyst at Mexico's Center for Economic Research and Teaching, called it ""an act of absolute irresponsibility.""

""It is a little demagogic to say, 'I am just like anybody else, I have no privileges,' when he isn't just an average citizen, he is a head of state,"" Crespo said. ""A good part of the country's stability and rule of law depend on his security and health.""

""It is one of the things I would say is populist about him,"" Crespo said.

Polimnia Romana Sierra organized Lopez Obrador's six-member, all-female security detail when he served as Mexico City mayor from 2000 to 2006. She said the group, known as ""gazelles,"" never acted as traditional bodyguards.

She said Lopez Obrador as mayor, and later during his first run as a presidential candidate in 2006, ""never left anybody with an unshaken hand. He accepted everything"" -- all the gifts, food and religious amulets he was given by supporters.

It was hardly an ideal security setup, but Romana Sierra noted the group never had to draw their guns.

It seemed Lopez Obrador wanted the team there to protect him against the crush of adoring crowds or attempts to politically embarrass him, for example, by paying someone to confront him verbally.

But even Romana Sierra said that as president, Lopez Obrador should accept traditional security. ""He not only should, he is obliged to.""

""He is no longer Andres Manuel,"" said Romana Sierra. ""He represents a whole nation.""

A total of 145 politicians -- most local figures -- have been killed in Mexico since September.

Lopez Obrador was eager to call for national unity and praised Pena Nieto for not interfering in the campaign.

Photos showed the two men shaking hands and strolling the opulent halls of the colonial-era National Palace off the main square known as the Zocalo, the political and cultural heart of the country.

Lopez Obrador said he was entering the meeting with in a ""conciliatory spirit"" and he hopes for ""a transition for the benefit of everyone.""

He won election Sunday in a landslide with about 53 percent of the votes against three competitors, after coming up short in two previous runs for the presidency.

Police confirmed to BuzzFeed News that there is an ongoing investigation, but they are not able to disclose any details at this point.

According to United Daily News, a Mandarin Chinese news website in Taiwan, Wilson contacted a local housing agent on Sept. 19 and signed a contract for a studio apartment in Taipei, Taiwan's capital.

The agent later alerted local police about his encounter with Wilson after recognizing him from news reports. Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) and local police are now trying to locate Wilson.

Wilson, 30, was charged on Sept. 19 with sexual assault, a second degree felony, after being accused of having sex with a 16-year-old girl at a hotel in Austin, Texas on Aug. 15. He reportedly met the girl on SugarDaddyMeet.com and paid her $500 for the encounter at the hotel. Police in Texas did not say whether Wilson was aware of the girl's age.

Wilson reportedly left the US for Taiwan after learning about the police investigation from the alleged victim's friend.

According to Taiwan's National Immigration Agency, Wilson arrived in Taiwan on Sept. 6, and he reportedly checked into a luxurious hotel in downtown Taipei. Hotel records obtained by Taiwanese media suggest that he originally planned to spend two nights at the Mandarin Oriental hotel, but abruptly checked out at noon on Sept. 7.",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/williamyang/cody-wilson-taiwan,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['1', '2', '1', '1', '4']"
3UEDKCTP9W8XTC5VD6LTY12CKEF7KX,"Abbreviated Pundit Round-up: Advice for Dems, analysis of Trump, and the importance of data","Trumpâ€”Russia

Anne Applebaum provides some analysis of how Trump directly benefited from Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Data is the energy, the lifeblood, the food and drink of any modern election campaign. From the mundane â€” names, addresses, voting districts â€” to the specifics of habits and interest, data matters more than television time, more than space on billboards, more than speeches and debates. In the olden days, it helped candidates figure out which doors to knock on. Now it involves sophisticated algorithms and highly controversial, carefully targeted campaigns designed to evoke primitive emotions â€” hope, fear, anger, joy â€” on social media. â€¦ Now we need to ask a new question: Was data also at the heart of the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia? Nearly a year ago, I speculated that the Trump campaign might have shared data with the Russian Internet Research Agency, the team that created fake personas and put up fake Facebook pages with the goal of spreading false stories about Hillary Clinton. The Russians certainly seemed to know what they were doing. On the one hand, the Russian team targeted people who they thought might be moved to support Trump by anti-immigration slogans and messages; on the other hand, they targeted black voters with messages designed to discourage them from voting at all.

Itâ€™s absolutely clear that critical data â€” the voter turnout model that Democrats used in both planning their campaign and allocating resources, along with names and contact information for Democratic voters â€” was stolen by the Russians, turned to GOP strategist, identified as valuable, passed to Trumpâ€™s campaign, and followed up with notes to make sure its importance was recognized. All of that is completely public in just indictments that have been made so far.

The Russian hackers, in other words, are the modern equivalents of the Watergate burglars in 1972. The only difference is the technology. The Watergate burglars broke into the Democratic campaign offices to tap phones and steal documents; the Russian hackers used malware and â€œcloud-based accountsâ€ to achieve the same goal.

Jackson Diehl on how Putin shouldnâ€™t feel too comfortable just because he has Trump in his pocket.

VladiÂ­mir Putin is probably still smirking about the chaos created by President Trumpâ€™s European tour, which has led thoughtful people on both sides of the Atlantic to conclude that not just NATO but the whole post-World War II liberal order led by the United States is doomed. They may be proved right. But I suspect that before they are, Putin, too, will come to regret the Helsinki summit. More than likely, it has torpedoed the Russian presidentâ€™s chances of extracting practical benefits from Trumpâ€™s fervent attempt to court him â€” favors Putin badly needs. As the foreign relations scholar Stephen Sestanovich put it on Twitter, â€œan idiot whoâ€™s too big an idiot canâ€™t be a useful idiot.â€

One day, the United States will genuinely fail. All nations do. One day, the system that has given us western liberal democracy will end. All systems must. One day there will absolutely be a last president. But damned if I see any reason why it should be Donald Trump.

Whatâ€™s coming could be intuited from the State Departmentâ€™s icy description of the summit. At her daily briefing Wednesday, department spokeswoman Heather Nauert began by condemning Putinâ€™s proposal to investigate U.S. officials â€” which Trump had called â€œan incredible offerâ€ â€” as â€œabsolutely absurd.â€ Then she described the â€œtakeawaysâ€ of Helsinki as the creation of three discussion groups among U.S. and Russian business executives, political scientists and the two national security councils. In other words, next to nothing.

Andrew Gawthorpe on the importance of US intelligence agencies in the ongoing fight to bring Trump to justice, and justice to Trump.

Donald Trumpâ€™s performance at his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki has convinced many observers that the US president has crossed the line into overtly colluding with a foreign power against the United States. As Trump parroted Russiaâ€™s line over that of his own intelligence agencies, the former CIA director John Brennan even said that his actions were â€œnothing short of treasonousâ€.

I think of it more as â€œconfirmedâ€ than â€œconvinced.â€ But otherwise â€¦ treason, yup.

For all his denials of collusion â€“ and his later back-pedalling â€“ Trump himself publicly asked Russia to hack into Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails during the presidential campaign. And according to a new indictment handed down by Robert Mueller, Moscowâ€™s agents attempted to do just that for the first time later the same day.

The latest indictments show that there was a two-way discussion going on at all levels between Republicans and Russians. It would be nice if Robert Mueller would hang around until we catch them all.

In the run-up to this yearâ€™s midterm elections, US cyber-intelligence officials report that Russia is continuing efforts â€œto undermine our democracyâ€ and that â€œthe warning lights are blinking red againâ€. Trumpâ€™s performance in Helsinki places the question of whether he will act appropriately on these warnings â€“ pushing back against an interference campaign that aims to benefit him politically, just as it did in 2016 â€“ in grave doubt.

Honestly, I donâ€™t think anyone should have any doubts about how Trump will act in 2018.

Trumpâ€™s Morals â€¦ where are they?

David Von Drehle on how Trump is bringing back old times. And not in the sense of â€œHappy days are here again.â€ More like â€œUber Deutschland.â€

Von Drehle starts with a tough opening, looking at the insane proportions of loss in World War II, then focusing down on a single soldier, one who plunged into D-Day knowing that it was likely his final day on the planet.

Iâ€™ve been wondering how I could explain to such a man that many of his fellow Americans â€” most notably the president â€” have already forgotten where his war came from and why he had to fight it. America in the age of Trump is undermining, if not dismantling, the international framework put in place to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again. At 25, Lundberg was no stranger to America First, protective tariffs and nationalism. No American of his age or older could be. These themes had been among the most prominent topics for public debate throughout his short life. And each had contributed, in one way or another, to the chain of events that took Lundberg to war. The isolationism that fueled the original America First movement died with the first bomb at Pearl Harbor. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930 had deepened the Great Depression, and that crisis fanned nationalism from Berlin to Tokyo.

And Iâ€™m stopping for a moment for no other reason than to set this sentence off on its own.

The danger and folly of these policies were written in an ocean of blood â€” Lundbergâ€™s and all the othersâ€™.

And yet, weâ€™re repeating them. The kindest interpretation is that Trump doesnâ€™t understand. Or has forgotten. Or doesnâ€™t see how his actions mirror that previous time. But the truth is he does. He hasnâ€™t. He sees. This isnâ€™t accident. Itâ€™s intent.

This U.S.-led network of international institutions has produced the longest period without a war between great powers since the days of the Roman Empire. Weâ€™re at 73 years and counting. Prior to its creation, Europe had plunged the world into two global wars in the span of just 25 years. This alone â€” peace among the great powers â€” has been worth every penny spent and every hour of haggling.

Every penny that Donald Trump has made in his life was purchased on the back of US investment in NATO, on benefits of the Marshall Plan, and on the sacrifices of the people like Lundberg who made this world possible. The horrible thing is, he knows that.

Nouriel Roubini on how Donald Trump may single-handedly send the world into the kind of economic crisis that helped create the conditions for World War II.

In 2017, the world economy was undergoing a synchronised expansion, with growth accelerating both in advanced economies and emerging markets. Moreover, despite stronger growth, inflation was tame â€“ if not falling â€“ even in economies such as the United States, where goods and labour markets were tightening. â€¦ Fast forward to 2018 and the picture looks very different. Though the world economy is still experiencing a lukewarm expansion, growth is no longer synchronised. Economic growth in the eurozone, the United Kingdom, Japan and a number of fragile emerging markets is slowing. And while the US and Chinese economies are still expanding, the former is being driven by unsustainable fiscal stimulus.

One of the things often overlooked about the tax plan and tax holiday pressed by the Republicans is that they were expressly designed to generate a temporary benefit. Because the money allocated by the plans is so narrowly focused, they wonâ€™t have the long-term stimulation of a working class tax cut. This is more like a weekend bender for those companies and individuals so wealthy already that the tax cut was more bonus pay than vital income. But it has been a boost for a few weeks that otherwise would have already started feeling the pinch.

The danger is that a negative feedback loop between economies and markets will take hold. The slowdown in some economies could lead to even tighter financial conditions in equity, bond and credit markets, which could further limit growth.

Trump, whose total understand of economics comes from reading Heritage talking points, is now pressing down hard on the â€œgive me inflationâ€ button. Which will compound the issues created by his tariffs.

Colbert King on the ethical and moral failings of Donald Trump â€” based on just a few of many examples.

Trump tweet: â€œEverybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. . . . Before taking office, people were assuming that we were going to War with North Korea.â€ Facts: During the five-hour meeting, North Korea did not stipulate how or when it would denuclearize. The nuclear threat from North Korea has not gone away. There was no assumption before Trump took office that the United States was going to war with North Korea. North Korea tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile only after Trump took office. It was the bellicose rhetoric and name-calling between Trump and Kim that raised concern about possible military conflict.

The part of Trumpâ€™s tweet about â€œbefore taking office.â€ where he states that under President Obama â€œeverybody thought we were going to warâ€ is the single most blatant attempt to rewrite history in Trumpâ€™s tenure. Sure, he flat out lies every day. But this isnâ€™t just lying on a grand scale, itâ€™s the quantity-has-a-quality-all-its-own of lying. I lie so large that it needs its own category. Because it was Trump who took a delicate situation in North Korea and made it infinitely worse, Trump who seemed to be pressing North Korea so hard, and so without evident reason, that he seemed determined to begin a conflict. And now itâ€™s Trump who is trying to present himself as the savior for tensions raised by Barack Obama. Itâ€™s not insane. Itâ€™s just crooked to the Nth degree.

Trump at the summit: â€œGermany is a captive of Russia because they supply [energy]. They got rid of their coal plants. They got rid of their nuclear. Theyâ€™re getting so much of the oil and gas from Russia. I think itâ€™s something that NATO has to look at.â€ From an Associated Press fact check: â€œIn 2017, Germany got more than one-third of its energy for electricity from coal and nearly 12 percent from nuclear plants. . . . Only 13 percent came from natural gas, with Russia as the major supplier. . . . Germany plans to retire nuclear plants by 2022 and intends to reduce its reliance on coal. But Germany has not â€˜got ridâ€™ of either.â€

Trump has continually depended on visits with foreign leaders as Prime Time for Lying. There is no nation too large or small to be exempt from his attacks. Except of course, for the one that attacked the US.

Dana Milbank looks into how Donald Trumpâ€™s powers as a huckster extends into channeling dead loved ones. And no, itâ€™s not the most critical Trump issue in a week where his treason and his sleaze are vying for headlines. But itâ€™s kind of funny.

A few weeks ago, while posthumously honoring a World War II hero, Trump gave the manâ€™s family a report on their departed loved one. He was â€œlooking down from Heaven, proud of this incredible honor, but even prouder of the legacy that lives on in each of you. So true.â€ â€¦

Honestly, you should read this just for the compiled list of Trump passing on messages from the Great Beyond. The manâ€™s act is lifted so thoroughly from a bottom-dollar spiritualist act that he might as well throw in a little knocking on tables and declare that his hair is actually ectoplasm.

Occasionally, something must get lost in the cloud and Trump receives a heavenly miscommunication. Speaking to a steelworker at the White House in March, Trump informed the man: â€œYour father, Herman, heâ€™s looking down, and heâ€™s very proud of you right now.â€ â€œOh, heâ€™s still alive,â€ the steelworker said. â€œThen heâ€™s even more proud of you,â€ Trump said.

Maybe weâ€™ve been going about this all wrong. This Trump guy, we donâ€™t need to have him impeached. We need to get the Ghostbusters. Or wait â€¦ could we get the nation exorcised? That seems completely appropriate.

Immigration

Elizabeth Wydra hits back at a pair of essays published earlier in he week suggesting that the Constitution doesnâ€™t mean what it says when it makes those born in the United States citizens.

The 14th Amendment is perhaps the greatest provision of our Constitution, in part because of its profound guarantee of citizenship to all who are born on American soil. After the Civil War, when members of the Reconstruction Congress assembled to draft the amendmentâ€™s birthright citizenship clause, they were writing against a backdrop of prejudice not only against African Americans but also immigrant communities including the Chinese and Roma. Much of the hostility against these immigrants was based on the same resentment toward immigrants in the United States today: that they would take away good jobs from people already here (while exhibiting a willingness to allow them to take jobs perceived as undesirable); that waves of immigrants were â€œinvading,â€ or, in the words of President Trump, â€œinfestingâ€ the country; and that they were arriving with different cultures and languages.

Republican efforts to limit birthright citizenship go hand in hand with the efforts to revoke the citizenship of some who they claim lied on their applicationâ€”even when they didnâ€™t. They made that step â€¦ and got away it. Next they go for birthright citizenship â€¦ but whether they get that or not, it wonâ€™t be the last attempt to redefine who counts as a â€œrealâ€ American.

Those who attack birthright citizenship, as did former Trump official Michael Anton in a recent Post op-ed, often go out of their way not only to misrepresent the plain meaning of the words of the 14th Amendment and those who drafted and ratified it, but also to ignore the racist and bloody history that required it in the first place. Sen. Lyman Trumbull, for example, a leading advocate in Congress for the citizenship clause, was quoted by Anton as somehow supporting his twisted reading of the clause.

If you want to brush up on this topic, read this op-ed. It gives a good answer for the most common alt-Reich arguments put forward in attempting limit citizenship.",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2018/7/22/1782560/-Abbreviated-Pundit-Round-up-Advice-for-Dems-analysis-of-Trump-and-the-importance-of-data#comments,"['Neutral', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Republican', 'Democratic']","['2', '5', '2', '1', '2']"
3H6W48L9F57DUI3CY6YDMYNS7SLPWZ,Asylum seekers accuse U.S. guards of cracking down on hunger strike: lawsuit,"By Alex Dobuzinskis

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Guards at a U.S. detention center for immigrants in California used pepper spray, beatings and scalding hot showers last year to punish eight Central American men who went on a hunger strike, two of the men and their attorneys said on Tuesday.

Human Rights Watch said inadequate health care led to the deaths of at least three immigrants over the past eight years at Adelanto Detention Facility near San Bernardino in Southern California, where the eight men were held after seeking asylum in the United States.

Legal complaints challenging conditions at U.S. detention facilities for immigrants have been made for years but the facilities have come under more scrutiny as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration carries out a hardline policy on legal and illegal immigration. [nL2N1T9279]

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency declined to respond to allegations in a civil rights lawsuit filed on behalf of the men, citing the agency's policy of not commenting on pending litigation.

""However, lack of comment should not be construed as agreement or stipulation with any of the allegations,"" ICE spokeswoman Lori K. Haley said in an email.

The eight men announced plans for a hunger strike on June 12, 2017, to peacefully protest lack of access to clean drinking water, quality food or clean clothes at Adelanto, according to the lawsuit, which said the men had fled violent criminal groups in their home countries of El Salvador and Honduras.

Guards responded by using pepper spray on the asylum seekers, beating some of them and placing the men in isolation for 10 days, the lawsuit said. The men ended their hunger strike within two days.

""They looked at us as if we were worse than criminals, because I don't think they would treat criminals the way they treated us,"" Alexander Antonio Burgos Mejia, 29, among the men suing over allegations of abuse, said at a news conference in Los Angeles. Mejia, who is from Honduras, is free on bond as he seeks asylum.

Another plaintiff, Josue Mateo Lemus Campos, 25, an immigrant from El Salvador who was also freed on bond from Adelanto, told reporters the scalding hot showers he was forced to endure after being pepper sprayed caused him ""insufferable pain.""

GEO Group, the private company that runs Adelanto, said in a statement that the lawsuit was ""completely baseless."" It said ICE reviewed the response to the strike and found no wrongdoing. The lawsuit was filed in May but was amended on Monday to add ICE as a defendant.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)

The Justice Department began doling out hundreds of millions of dollars in grants on Wednesday to non-sanctuary cities and states whose law enforcement cooperates with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities, according to The Crime Report.

""After the stay was granted, the Justice Department promptly moved to begin the distribution of nearly $200 million in Byrne JAG funds to jurisdictions that share the department's commitment to keeping criminal aliens off our streets and our law-abiding citizens safe,"" Justice spokesman Devin O'Malley said, The Washington Times reported. ""Reviews of some applications remain ongoing.""

On Tuesday, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals partially overturned a nationwide injunction on grant money on 2017 Edward Bryne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants.

""The stay of the nationwide injunction granted last night by the Seventh Circuit is another major victory for the rule of law,"" Justice Department spokesman Devin O'Malley said, according to The Washington Examiner.

Municipalities and police departments may use JAG grants for equipment, training personnel, and other needs.

Last summer, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a crackdown on sanctuary cities and those entities that didn't cooperate with ICE agents could lose JAG grants.

Chicago filed a lawsuit seeking a nationwide injunction claiming that the conditions on the grants did not follow federal laws.

U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber granted the injunction in September.

In April, a three-judge panel agreed with Leinenweber's decision.

But Tuesday's decision by the 7th Circuit Court limited the injunction to Chicago.

Tributes from former US presidents and across the political spectrum have poured in for Republican Senator John McCain, who has died aged 81.

Barack Obama, who beat him to the White House in 2008, said they had shared a ""fidelity to something higher"".

George W Bush described him as ""a patriot of the highest order"".

President Donald Trump, whom McCain had strongly criticised, tweeted his ""deepest sympathies"" to McCain's family but did not comment on his life.

By contrast, First Lady Melania Trump thanked the late senator for his ""service to the nation"".

Sources quoted by US media said Mr Trump would not be invited to the funeral and the current administration would probably be represented by Vice President Mike Pence.

Former Presidents Obama and George W Bush are expected to give eulogies.

McCain was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in July last year and had been undergoing treatment.

But on Friday his family announced he had decided to discontinue that treatment.

A statement from his office on Saturday said McCain had died in Arizona surrounded by family members.

His family said he would lie in state in Phoenix, Arizona, and in Washington DC before a funeral at the Washington National Cathedral and his burial in Annapolis, Maryland.

How is he being remembered?

""He was a public servant in the finest traditions of our country,"" Mr Bush said. ""And to me, he was a friend whom I'll deeply miss.""

Mr Obama said that despite being his Democratic rival, they had shared the ideals ""for which generations of Americans and immigrants alike have fought, marched and sacrificed"".

Sarah Palin, who was McCain's running mate during his 2008 presidential bid, said the world had lost ""an American original"".

From outside the US, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed McCain as ""a great American patriot"" whose ""support for Israel never wavered.""

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said McCain's lifetime of public service had been an ""inspiration to millions"".

As a hearse brought Mr McCain's body from his ranch in Sedona, Arizona, to a funeral home in Phoenix, people waving flags lined the street.

Who was John McCain?

The son and grandson of Navy admirals, he was a bomber pilot during the war in Vietnam. When his plane was shot down, he spent more than five years as a prisoner-of-war.

While being held by his captors, he suffered torture that left him with lasting disabilities.

In politics, he took a conservative line on many issues, opposing abortion and advocating higher defence spending.

He backed the 2003 invasion of Iraq and criticised President Obama for not intervening more in the Syrian civil war.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Barack Obama ran against Mr McCain in 2008

However, he also gained a reputation as a Republican maverick who was willing to cross party lines on a range of issues.

In July last year, just after his diagnosis, he took part in a late-night Senate session and gave the deciding vote - with a thumbs-down gesture - against partially repealing the contentious Obamacare healthcare law. The move reportedly infuriated Mr Trump.

McCain also criticised President Trump's hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigration and his attacks on the media.

A fighter to the very end

By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter

John McCain was born shortly before World War II, at the dawn of the ""American Century"" - a time when the US was at the peak of its political, military and cultural power. He dies at what could be considered that age's twilight, as the nation turns inward and contemplates walls, literal and metaphorical, to insulate itself from the rest of this world.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Flags flew were lowered in honour of McCain at the Washington Monument

The life of the senator from Arizona marked the arc of this journey.

He suffered, as the nation suffered, from the morass of Vietnam.

As a young politician he was tempted by the lure of power and money, caught up in an influence-peddling scandal that nearly cost him his career.

In his first run for president in 2000, he capitalised on an anti-establishment sentiment and longing for authenticity that would later come to crest with Donald Trump's election. In 2008, he won the Republican nomination, only to see his hopes dashed by the phenomenon that was Barack Obama and a crumbling US economy.

McCain never won the top political office for which he longed. Throughout his life, however, he offered a full-throated defence of an America that was active and engaged in the world. In his final years he sparred with Mr Trump over the direction of the Republican Party and the principles it should embrace.

It's an open question as to whether these views have a future in his party. McCain, however, fought for what he believed was right until the very end.

German police have opened 10 cases against far-right protesters who gave the illegal Hitler salute during unrest in Chemnitz on Monday.

About 6,000 people took part in the far-right demonstration and 1,000 in a rival anti-fascist rally, police said.

The far-right groups marched in the eastern city after a German man died in a fight involving foreigners on Sunday.

The swastika and other Nazi symbols are banned in Germany. The law prescribes a fine or jail term for the Nazi salute.

It remains unclear what triggered Sunday's fight in which the 35-year-old man, named only as Daniel H, was fatally stabbed.

Two young men - a Syrian and an Iraqi - are in custody, suspected of stabbing him.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel again condemned the far-right protests, in which several foreigners were chased and injured by violent participants. ""Hate in the streets,"" she said, ""has nothing to do with our constitutional state"".

Chemnitz is in Saxony, a region where the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and the Pegida movement are particularly strong. They deplore Mrs Merkel's liberal immigration policy.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The far-right placards say: ""Stop the asylum flood!""

Police said they had not anticipated such a rapid and large mobilisation of far-right supporters on the streets.

On Monday night there were 591 police officers confronting about 7,000 demonstrators, who had rallied via social media. At least 20 people were injured as fireworks and other objects were thrown.

Saxony Interior Minister Roland WÃ¶ller said far-right activists had quickly travelled to Chemnitz not only from other parts of eastern Germany but also from the western regions of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia.

How did the trouble start?

The stabbing happened at about 03:15 (01:15 GMT) on Sunday, on the sidelines of a street festival.

The far-right demonstration in the city centre on Sunday caused the festival to be cancelled abruptly.

The stabbing victim, a carpenter aged 35, died in hospital. He had a German mother and a Cuban father.

Two other German men with him, aged 33 and 38, were seriously hurt, police say.

The Syrian detainee is 23 and the Iraqi 22.

Police have denied rumours on social media that the fight was linked to the sexual harassment of a woman.

A half-Cuban woman who grew up with Daniel H, Nancy Larssen, told Deutsche Welle news that media misreporting had helped fuel the ""horrible"" far-right protest.

""It's sad that in the media they're just saying that a German has died, and that's why all the neo-Nazis and hooligans are out, but the media should describe who died, and what skin colour he had, because I don't think they'd be doing all this if they knew,"" she said.

What did the government say?

""We don't tolerate such unlawful assemblies and the hounding of people who look different or have different origins and attempts to spread hatred on the streets,"" Mrs Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told journalists.

""That has no place in our cities and we, as the German government, condemn it in the strongest terms. Our basic message for Chemnitz and beyond is that there is no place in Germany for vigilante justice, for groups that want to spread hatred on the streets, for intolerance and for extremism.""

Why is the migrant issue so thorny?

In 2015, Chancellor Merkel decided to let in a record 890,000 asylum seekers. Syrians fleeing the civil war comprised the biggest group - a 403% rise on Syrian arrivals the previous year, the German migration office reported.

322ZSN9Z5H2ZD8DZ5H1EWG5YCPFT44,Autopsy finds Iowa student died from 'sharp force injuries',"BROOKLYN, Iowa (AP) -- The Iowa college student who was allegedly abducted by a stranger while running last month in a small town was stabbed to death, investigators announced Thursday.

Preliminary autopsy results from the state medical examiner's office determined that 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts was the victim of a homicide who died from ""multiple sharp force injuries,"" the Division of Criminal Investigation announced in a news release.

State medical examiner Dennis Klein said in an interview that the finding means a sharp-edged or pointed object such as a knife was used to attack Tibbetts. He declined comment on the details of her injuries, and said that his office would hire consultants, including forensic anthropologists, to analyze her remains further and make additional findings.

The man charged with first-degree murder in Tibbetts' death, Cristhian Bahena Rivera, allegedly led investigators to her body early Tuesday in a cornfield outside of Brooklyn, Iowa, the town where the University of Iowa psychology major was last seen one month prior. While investigators were confident then that the body was that of Tibbetts, the autopsy definitively confirmed her identity.

Prosecutors allege that Rivera abducted Tibbetts while she was out for an evening run in Brooklyn on July 18, killed her and disposed of her body in the secluded location.

A criminal complaint alleges that Rivera confessed during a lengthy interrogation that began Monday to following Tibbetts in his car, getting out on foot and chasing after her. Rivera told investigators that he panicked after Tibbetts threatened to call police on her cellphone, he blacked out and later came to when he was unloading her bloody body from the trunk of a car, it says.

Rivera worked for the last four years at a dairy farm a few miles from where Tibbetts was last seen. He and Tibbetts have no known connections other than that Rivera allegedly told investigators that he saw her running previously. Investigators zeroed in on him as the suspect after obtaining footage from surveillance cameras showing a vehicle connected to him circling the area of Tibbetts' running route.

Earlier this week, investigators said they were uncertain how Tibbetts was killed or whether she was sexually assaulted. They've made no mention of recovering a knife or other weapon linked to the death.

Rivera, a native of Mexico who is suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, made his initial court appearance Wednesday and is being jailed on a $5 million cash-only bond. He faces life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted.

Within hours of the arrest, President Donald Trump seized on the news that Rivera was allegedly in the country illegally to call for stricter immigration laws. And in an interview that aired Thursday, he said on ""Fox &amp; Friends"" that Tibbetts was a ""beautiful young girl"" killed by a ""horrible person that came in from Mexico, illegally here.""

Trump has claimed that people living in the U.S. illegally often commit crimes, but studies by social scientists and the libertarian Cato Institute reject that assertion. The studies show that states with higher shares of people living in the country illegally have lower violent crime rates.

The president also said the suspect was ""found by"" agents from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, an agency that some liberals have called for abolishing because of tactics they view as overly harsh. An ICE spokesman said Thursday that its agents worked with state and local investigators in ""identifying, locating and interviewing the suspect.""

Division of Criminal Investigation spokesman Mitch Mortvedt agreed that ICE played a ""significant role"" in the case, particularly in helping confirm Rivera's identity and immigration status.

Rivera's defense attorney, Allan Richards, has denounced Trump for prejudging his client's guilt, saying the president's comments would make it hard for Rivera to get a fair trial.

""Let's let the process go,"" he said Thursday. ""The process is about truth-finding in a rational, peaceful and efficient manner. We're only at the very preliminary stages.""

31JUPBOOROMCDWSW8BP0R1BMKBHL8I,Rep. Yoder Promises More Middle-Class Outsourcing for Kansas Voters,"Kansas GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder is doubling down on his plan to help business groups import hundreds of thousands of cheap foreign workers to take many jobs which would otherwise be worked by Americans at middle-class wages.

Yoder is campaigning for reelection, and is justifying his outsourcing plan by portraying himself as a moderate between two extremes:

There is this sense in this country that you are against all legal immigration, on the right, or you are for open borders and abolishing ICE, like my [Democratic] opponent. My point is that that is not where most of the country is. The country wants sensible immigration laws. So Iâ€™m working with people in both parties to actually get that done, and we lead by example.

Yoder worked with most Democrats and all GOP legislators on July 25 to insert his four-part cheap-labor plan in the 2019 homeland defense spending plan. GOP leaders in the House have the power to cut Yoderâ€™s plan when it is reviewed by the House committee on rules, which is chaired by Texas Rep. Pete Sessions.

The plan has prompted widespread protests by Americans who have lost information-technology jobs and salaries to the roughly 200,000 Indians visa-workers who stand to gain from his plan to fast-track visa-workers towards green cards.

Yoderâ€™s plan is being applauded by the business groups which will be able to import a huge extra stream of cheap replacement workers. That inflow would help their investors offset the wage-raising impact of President Donald Trumpâ€™s lower-immigration/higher-wages policy.

.@IBM strongly supports the inclusion of @RepKevinYoderâ€™s #HR392 in the House FY19 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill. This is an important step towards eliminating the green card backlog. â€” IBMPolicy (@IBMpolicy) July 26, 2018

Amazon applauds @KevinYoder on the passage of his amendment to the @DHSgov appropriations bill, H.R. 392, that would remove the per-country limit on green cards. This is an important step towards green card reform, and Amazonians thank you for your leadership on this issue. â€” Amazon Policy (@amazon_policy) July 25, 2018

Large streams of immigrants and visa-workers have allowed companies to cap Americansâ€™ wages, in the coastal cities and the heartland cities, such as Kansas City. For example, in Yoderâ€™s district, companies employ roughly 1,400 visa workers to in white-collar jobs sought by young Kansas graduates, according to H1BFacts.com, which organizes federal data to show the number of H-1B visa-workers in each legislatorâ€™s district.

The H1BFacts site shows that employers in Yoderâ€™s district asked the federal government in 2017 for approval to import 830 foreign white-collar workers. They included laboratory assistants and interior designers who would be paid just merely $30,000 per year, accountants who would be paid $42,000, programmers who would get $56,000 and hospital doctors who would get just $65,000.

The list also includes requests for foreign workers to fill a variety of boutique jobs â€” a sports manager at $110,000, a vice-president for lending at $75 per hour, ophthalmologists at $107,000 a year, a finance manager at $105,000 per year, and a business analyst for $97,000 a year.

The H-1B visa program has had a huge impact on white-collar workers in technology, and increasingly, in healthcare.

There is much official evidence that corruption and anti-American discrimination is endemic in the H-1B program, which allows U.S. companies to easily outsource middle-class jobs via foreign-based companies. For example, an Indian CEO was recently arrested on several charges, including charges that his imported H-1B workers were required to pay him under the table for the cost of getting the visa. The payments would allow the employer to undercut American workers and to win low-cost subcontracts from brand-name companies.

Yoderâ€™s four-part plan allows a vast expansion of this white-collar outsourcing by putting at least 200,000 Indian H-1B visa-workers and roughly 50,000 Chinese â€” plus roughly 250,000 of their family members â€” on a fast-track to green cards. Even if Yoder drops his bill, the immigration system is expected to provide employer-sponsored green-cards to another 120,000 Indians during the next five years.

Yoderâ€™s supporters say his HR 392 plan would end rules which unfairly cap the annual inflow of immigrants from individual countries, and would not allow companies to import more than 140,000 visas to workers and families each year.

And don't worry, HR 392 is still marching its way toward the finish line. The power of a very simple idea that is just and fair will always conquer any convoluted argument thrown in its path! â€” Leon Fresco (@FrescoLeon) August 28, 2018

But critics say Yoderâ€™s removal of the â€œcountry capsâ€ would flood the white-collar marketplace with an extra 250,000 Indian and Chinese white-collar workers who are now working for U.S. companies on short-term visas. Yoderâ€™s HR392 would also allow outsourcing firms to offer almost-free and fast citizenship to their next cohort of visa-worker recruits and would give Indian managers a dominant share of the U.S. software and computer workforce. Already, the CEOs of Google and Microsoft are former Indian H-1B workers.

The plan would also mean that U.S. employers would face a delay of several years if they try to win green cards for people from outside India and China.

In his August 29 radio appearance, Yoderâ€™s portrayed his HR392 fast-track plan as a noble blow against discrimination:

We end the per-country cap that has created an almost million-person, hundreds and hundreds of thousands, of particularly Indian and some Chinese immigrants that might take decades to get a green card because of a discriminatory policy that puts them at the back of the line on a country cap. We fixed that in our bill.

Nationwide, the U.S. government helps companies keep a population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar visa-workers in American jobs. The various visa programs â€” H-1B, L-1, J-1, H4 EAD, OPT, TN â€” allow employers to hire cheap foreign doctors, therapists, programmers, engineers, accountants, designers, architects, managers, recruitment specialists, P.R. experts and many other professionals. These huge labor programs help to lower salaries for many American college graduates and to push many skilled American workers into new, low-tech, lower-wage careers, such as journalism.

Yoderâ€™s four-part labor importation plan also raises the number of imported blue-collar visa-workers by tripling the H-2B program for seasonal workers up to almost 200,000 workers per year, and by expanding the H-2A farm labor program. Yoder said:

We fixed the H-2B visa program which is the seasonal workers, our ag workers, H-2A. So to me that is showing leadership on the issues, saying look, we need better border security, we have to stop human trafficking and drug trafficking from illegally coming into our country while at the same time focusing on how we can acknowledge that immigration, legal immigration, is a critical part of our economy and part of our cultural diversity.

Yoder also expands the inflow of migrants by barring border officials from detaining migrants who bring children unless the children are kept in the same detention centers, and by barring the deportation of migrants who say they came to the United States as children. He said:

We put a prohibition against family separations â€” thatâ€™s in our bill. Part of the Dream Act, in our bill, saying you canâ€™t deport Dreamers, thatâ€™s in my bill.

This border policy also has an impact on Americansâ€™ wages because the lax border-rules have allowed at least 400,000 migrants into the United States to plead for asylum. The asylum system has gotten so backlogged that officials are forced to release migrants who bring their children up to the border and also provide them with work permits. In 2017, 400,000 work permits were provided to people who are claiming asylum, so aiding cheap-labor employers.

President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions are rolling out various legal and regulatory fixes to stop this inflow of cheap labor, but Yoderâ€™s policy against â€œfamily separationsâ€ would effectively allow a limitless inflow of cheap-labor migrants into the U.S. workplaces.

Yoderâ€™s bill also defunds any action by border officials to implement Sessionsâ€™ asylum reforms, although Yoder has hinted he may drop the curbs on Sessionsâ€™ asylum reforms.

In his August 29 broadcast, Yoder also praised the government-imposed diversity which is inflaming civic disagreement and conflict within the United States:

I think diversity makes our community a better place to live in, and so weâ€™ve gotten polarized in this country where you have people like my opponent on the extreme left on immigration, and others in my party on the extreme right who are either anti-legal immigration and illegal [immigration], and they have attacked me.

Government-imposed civic variety is good for progressives because it weakens the local and regional solidarity which helps Americans solves civic problems without the federal involvement. Diversity is also good for CEOs and investors because the inevitable civic disputes distract public attention from widening economic divides.

Kevin Yoder (@RepKevinYoder) August 27, 2018

Yoderâ€™s district voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and he is facing a tough reelection battle against a far-left candidate, Sharice Davis. According to Rollcall.com:

A poll commissioned by Democrat Sharice Davids shows a close race between Davids and GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder in Kansasâ€™ 3rd District. Davids led Yoder by 3 points in an initial head to head matchup, garnering 46 percent to Yoderâ€™s 43 percent. The libertarian candidate Chris Clemmons was at 4 percent with 7 percent undecided, according to the polling memo. Yoder is a top Democratic target, representing the Kansas City suburbs in a district Hillary Clinton won by 3 points in 2016. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race Tilts Republican.

In his campaign ads, Yoder repeatedly slams Davis as an open-borders zealot, while Davis is trying to back away from her promise to abolish the ICE immigration-enforcement agency:

Yoder camp attacks Davids over July interview: â€œAnyone who listens to this podcast can hear it it plainly â€” her position is to get rid of immigration enforcement entirelyâ€¦ This wasnâ€™t a slip of the tongue, itâ€™s her radical beliefs on full displayâ€ https://t.co/Z1g3ZPbMPW #ksleg â€” Bryan Lowry (@BryanLowry3) August 23, 2018

However, Yoderâ€™s pro-business cheap-labor policy is deeply unpopular. Many public polls show the public likes immigrants and wants to like immigration â€” but mostly opposes cheap-labor migration which aids investors but hurts Americans.

Business groups and Democrats tout polls which prod Americans to declare support for migrants or the claim that the United States is a â€œNation of Immigrants.â€ The alternative â€œpriority or fairnessâ€ polls â€” plus the 2016 election â€” show that voters in the polling booth put a much higher priority on helping their families, neighbors, and fellow nationals get decent jobs in a high-tech, high-immigration, low-wage economy.

Yoderâ€™s four-part push is being opposed by several groups of U.S. professionals who have lost jobs and salaries to the visa-workers.

.@realDonaldTrump @Dawnnewyorker handed you a letter which intelligently and emotionally tells the truth about outsourcing, offshoringâ€¦ pic.twitter.com/4iPhp5Q5Pn â€” Sara Blackwell (@4US_Workers) August 17, 2018

Each year, four million young Americans enter the workforce â€” and the government imports 1 million legal immigrants, replenishes the population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers, and does little to repatriate the resident population of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.

Overall, the Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via immigration shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap foreign labor.

That process spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. The policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kidsâ€™ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions. Immigration also pulls investment and wealth away from heartland states because investment flows towards the large immigrant populations living in the coastal states.

3T8DUCXY0OO0AEJBMCX5DOGEY8HT96,Trump's pick to run consumer watchdog faces skeptical Senate,"WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Kathy Kraninger, President Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee to take over the nationâ€™s watchdog for banks, credit card companies and payday lenders, made her public debut in front of the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, where she faced extremely hostile questioning from Democrats.

Democratic senators called into question her qualifications to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as well as her role in the Trump administrationâ€™s immigration policy in her current job with the Office of Management and Budget. But with a 51-seat Republican majority, Kraningerâ€™s nomination to run the CFPB is likely to be confirmed.

Trump nominated Kraninger on June 18 to replace Mick Mulvaney, the administrationâ€™s budget director, who has been acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau since late November. Mulvaney has taken the bureau in a more business-friendly direction than his predecessor Richard Cordray, President Barack Obamaâ€™s director of the CFPB.

Before her nomination, Kraninger, 43, was a relatively unknown mid-level bureaucrat working inside the OMB, overseeing roughly $250 billion in federal government programs. Before that she was a Congressional staffer working on budget and appropriations bills.

Kraningerâ€™s nomination has been somewhat controversial, since she has no experience in banking or financial services.

â€œNow (Mick Mulvaney) wants his protege to run the agency. She has no experience whatsoever in consumer protection,â€ said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who is the top Democrat on the committee.

The White House and Republicans argue that Kraningerâ€™s experience at the OMB, where she arranged programs for large government departments like Homeland Security and the Federal Reserve, makes her qualified as a manager for a large government bureau.

â€œGiven her depth and diversity of public service experience, I have the utmost confidence that she is well-prepared to lead the Bureau in enforcing federal consumer financial laws and protecting consumers in the financial marketplace,â€ said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, at the start of the hearing.

Thursdayâ€™s hearing was Kraningerâ€™s first public appearance since her nomination. Her positions on various issues facing the CFPB â€” from the bureauâ€™s regulations on payday loans to how aggressive she would be going after big banks for wrongdoing â€” were largely unknown coming in, and she didnâ€™t provide much clarity in her answers to committee members.

Kraninger worked directly under Mulvaney at OMB, and is unlikely to take the CFPB in a sharply different direction.

Kraningerâ€™s prepared remarks called for the CFPB to be â€œfair and transparentâ€ and to â€œempower consumers to make good choices and provide certainty for market participants,â€ and echo statements by Mulvaney, who believes the bureauâ€™s power is too unrestrained.

One of Kraningerâ€™s biggest critics has been Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who has vocally opposed her nomination from the start. The CFPB is Warrenâ€™s brainchild â€” she proposed such a bureau when she was a professor at Harvard University.

Warren focused most of her questioning on Kraningerâ€™s role in setting and implementing the Trump administrationâ€™s policy of separating children from their parents who crossed the border illegally.

In her current role at the White House, Kraninger oversaw budget requests from the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies. The DHS is responsible for implementing the administrationâ€™s immigration policies.

In response to a question from Warren, who asked for Kraningerâ€™s opinion on the Trump child separation policy, she said â€œIt is not appropriate to give my opinion.â€

An exasperated Warren took her non-answer as a signal that she was involved in some way.

â€œYou were part of it. It is moral stain that will follow you for the rest of your life.â€

34O39PNDK7Q6ISLGG7664FAMYKLBRD,The Passionate Intensity Of The Worst,"A Stuart man is behind bars, accused of threatening to kill U.S. Rep. Brian Mast's children in response to current immigration policies.

Mast has three young children.

Laurence Wayne Key is facing federal charges under the offense of ""communication of a threat to kidnap or injure a person.""

A criminal complaint shows Key is accused of calling Mast's Washington, D.C. office Monday, and telling an intern who answered the phone, ""I'm going to find the Congressman's kids and kill them. If you're going to separate kids at the border, I'm going to kill his kids. Don't try to find me because you won't.'

Documents show that the intern reported the phone call to their supervisor. The FBI was made aware of the threat and began an investigation. Key was arrested shortly after allegedly making the threat.

In an interview with the FBI and a Martin County deputy, Key told investigators he did not threaten to kill Mast's children, but said if Mast supports President Trump's immigration policies, Mast should be separated from his children.

Key's social media pages show he is very politically active. He volunteers regularly for the Democratic Party of Martin County and has volunteered many hours for Planned Parenthood, according to a friend of Key's.

Last summer, a leftist attempted mass murder of Republican members of Congress. And now one is threatening to kidnap one's children. Why would anybody want to run for Congress if this is what it means having to face?

If you are a Republican member of Congress today, do you dare to go to the mall with your kids? To take your daughter to a concert? Your son to a ball game?

Jonathan V. Last of the Weekly Standard has written an important essay about the collapsing of American norms. Excerpts:

[Maxine Waters's exhortation to mob action against Trump administration officials] is a disgusting and appalling lack of civility and a departure from the norms of American political discourse and I cannot fathom where liberals got the idea for it and, by the by, here is a list of some things the current president of the United States of America said while campaigning for his office:

""I'd like to punch him in the face.""

""Maybe he should have been roughed up.""

""Part of the problem . . . is no one wants to hurt each other anymore.""

""I don't know if I'll do the fighting myself or if other people will.""

""The audience hit back. That's what we need a little bit more of.""

""If you do [hurt him], I'll defend you in court, don't worry about it.""

""I'll beat the crap out of you.""

""Knock the crap out of him, would you? I promise you, I will pay your legal fees.""

It's a mystery, isn't it? Where in the world did Maxine Waters and the Red Hen and the people in that Mexican restaurant come up with such terrible, norm-shattering ideas about civility?

Last quotes from a bone-chilling column at The Federalist, in which the author, one Jesse Kelly, thrills to think about the pleasure Indians took in scalping the whites who were coming to take all their land. Here's how Kelly's column ends:

So, back to scalping thing. When you make that long trek to the reservation the leftists have set up for you -- and make that trek you will -- what memories do you want to take with you? When living in the liberal utopian nightmare of 57 genders and government control over everything in your life, you will want to have been a Lakota. You'll want to know, to remember, even just cherish the knowledge that, one day, you rode out onto the plains and made them feel pain.

How the hell did this get published? I wrote in this space last year several strong commentaries denouncing Tommy Curry, a radical black philosophy professor at Texas A&amp;M, for taking similar stands (regarding violence against whites) in his lectures and public commentaries. And here we see a white conservative taking more or less the same position, from his point of view. Yesterday, leftist writer Hamilton Nolan wrote a screed looking forward to political violence in this country, ""when citizens decide en masse that their political system is corrupt, racist, and unresponsive.""

This blog's commenter Matt in VA is not a Christian, is gay, and is on on the Right. He repeatedly denounces me for being soft, and unwilling to engage in violence to defend the Right. He's an intelligent guy who often has smart and challenging things to say, so as long as he doesn't advocate taking specific violent actions, I'll publish him, as I publish left-wing commenters with whom I strongly disagree. Let me say clearly, though, that even though I am not a pacifist, and even though I believe that all people have a right to defend themselves, even violently, within certain boundaries, we must never allow ourselves to become fond of violence, and never of political violence. I think this is true of everyone, but especially of Christians. That opens up the doors of Hell ... as Jonathan Last grasps. Here's more from his column:

Which is why so many people were prospectively worried about Trump. Not because Trump was the source of some new brand of political violence, but because political violence is a Pandora's Box. And once it is opened it cannot be shut until it burns itself out -- because everyone loves this sort of thing, when it's their side doing the scalping. Putting a man like Donald Trump in the presidency gave oxygen to these elements or, to mix our metaphors, pushed the undercurrents that have always been there much closer to the surface. What people failed to realize is that a thing like Donald Trump's presidency Trump doesn't just bring out the white nationalists. It brings out the radicals in response. It opens the box for everyone.

Now maybe it'll all work out for us. Our institutions might be diminished, but they're still relatively robust. It's just one hipster farm-to-table restaurant, one geriatric congresswoman, one crank on a website. One guy threatening to kidnap and kill a congressman's kids. (Oh yes, this is a thing which happened last week, too.) But these situations are inherently unpredictable. Black swans are gonna black swan.

Please read the whole thing.

I'm thinking right now of an American friend who served as one of the peacekeeping troops in the Balkans, after the civil war there. He told me of the time he had to enter a large barn in which Serb militiamen had confined scores of Bosnian Muslim males. The Serbs cut loose on them with machine guns, murdering them all in one spasm of violence. The massacre had taken place long before my friend and the other troops entered the barn. The bodies had long since been carted away. Here's the thing, though: coating the walls was black slime. It was some sort of fungus that was living on blood and other human remains embedded in the wood of the barn's interior. The black slime was everywhere, and it was eating what was left of all those Muslim men, whose only crime was to be the Other.

This is what human beings can do to each other, if they let their passions run free. Look at this image from the 1916 lynching of Jesse Washington, a black teenager in Waco, Texas. Between 15,000 and 20,000 people showed up to watch him being tortured and killed. It was entertainment. They were seeking mob vengeance upon this man who had been convicted of raping and killing a white woman:

Those weren't Bosnian Serbs. Those were Americans. And though these happened to be white Texans, do not for one second think that any of you -- whatever your race, wherever you're from -- are immune to the passions that lead to these kinds of atrocities.

The mobs can be right-wing or left-wing. They can be religious or anti-religious. One of the most beautiful streets in the world is the Boulevard Saint-Germain, on the Left Bank of Paris. One night, during the Revolutionary years, the authorities packed some arrested Catholic priests into a horse-drawn coach to take them to the prison the revolutionaries had made of the old abbey. The mob, knowing that priests were in the coach, set upon it with fury, plunging swords through the walls of the carriage. By the time the coach arrived at the prison, blood was gushing out of the holes left by the swords.

Historian Christopher Hibbert recalls another infamous incident during the Revolution:

The same afternoon another small gang of armed men burst into the garden of the Carmelite Convent off the Rue de Vaugirard where about 150 priests who had been held prisoner for the past fortnight, were gathered under guard, several of them reading their office. The men advanced upon them, calling out for the Archbishop of Arles. One of the priests went forward to meet them, demanding a fair trial for himself and his fellow-prisoners. A shot was fired and his shoulder was smashed. The Archbishop, after praying for a moment on his knees, then went towards the men himself. ""I am the man you are looking for,"" he said, and was immediately struck across the face with a sword. As he fell to the ground a pike was plunged through his chest. At that moment an officer of the National Guard appeared and managed to get the priests away to the nearby church where they gave each other absolution. While they were saying prayers for the dying, the armed gang broke through the door and dragged the priests out in pairs to slaughter them in the garden. After several had been killed a man with an air of authority arrived at the church calling out, ""Don't kill them so quickly. We are meant to try them."" Thereafter each priest was summoned before a makeshift tribunal before being executed. He was asked if he was now prepared to take the constitutional oath and when he said that he was not -- as all of them did -- he was taken away to be killed. Some bodies were removed in carts, the rest thrown down a well from which their broken skeletons were recovered seventy years later.

Here is what remains of that site of the executions. It's the back door of the convent. On the spot of the murders, the plaque reads, in Latin, ""Here they fell""

It can happen here. You and your loved ones might be victims. You and your loved ones might be victimizers. Don't think for a second that you are immune to these passions. I'm not. You aren't either.",http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/the-passionate-intensity-of-the-worst/,"['Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Republican']","['2', '5', '1', '5', '3']"
3SCKNODZ0YYY1IQYAJD9QTJGE9K7N2,New ride-hailing firm for women seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen,"

A new ride-hailing business designed mostly for women is headed to the nationâ€™s capital. Safr, which launched in Boston about a year ago, allows drivers and riders to choose their preferred gender for the person who will be sharing the vehicle with them during the ride. (Image from Safrâ€™s website)

A new ride-hailing app that caters to women by allowing drivers and riders to choose their preferred gender of the person who will be sharing their vehicle is on its way to the District and â€” who knows? â€” maybe even the Supreme Court.

The new service is Safr, and itâ€™s built on the idea that women feel more comfortable driving or riding with other women. It rolled out about a year ago in Boston and looks a little like a retread of Chariot for Women, a Boston-based ride-hailing service that ran into flak over its gender-specific business model.

Safr talks a lot about â€œempoweringâ€ women in its pitch. Though Safr is hiring men, too, its website and its boss make it clear that its reason to be is luring mostly female drivers and riders to the app with the promise that they wonâ€™t have to share a car with the opposite sex if they donâ€™t want to.

â€œWe want to make sure that everything we are doing, especially on the ride-sharing side of it, is that we are giving equal opportunities to women to become a part of the gig economy in the transportation sector,â€ Safr chief executive Syed Gilani said Friday in an interview. â€œThey can have equal opportunity to drive, and they can have equal opportunity to take a ride.â€

Women make up only about 20 percent of the drivers on more-established platforms, Gilani said, but he believes Safrâ€™s special features will change that.

Safrâ€™s most notable feature allows users to express a preference for the gender of their driver or their passenger â€” a feature that has also shown up in the app of RideAustin, a nonprofit ride-hailing service in Texas, as â€œfemale driver mode.â€ If a woman using Safr wants a female driver, and one is available, sheâ€™ll get a female driver. If not, the rider would have the option to cancel, Gilani said.

Gilani, when asked about the legal implications of a public transportation business that allows people to select the gender of others in the vehicle, said itâ€™s no different from a womanâ€™s asking for a female obstetrician, a female trainer at the public gym or a female security officer to conduct a pat-down at an airport checkpoint.

â€œWe are a platform. We are not forcing anybody to select anybody. We are not saying you need to do that or you must do that,â€ Gilani said. â€œWe are saying this is an option on our platform with our technology.â€

[Growing trend toward women-only ride-hailing seems like a step backward]

In addition to allowing users to select a gender preference on the app, Safr says it has other features that make the service safer for women than Uber and Lyft. For one, Safr says itâ€™s doing a better job vetting drivers and making sure they stay vetted. Before a person can drive with Safr, the company conducts comprehensive background checks and requires face-to-face interviews with prospective drivers.

Safr also touts several in-transit security features. Before the ride begins, users receive a color code that has to match driver and rider. Thereâ€™s also a 24/7 ride-tracking center and a panic button that allows users to send an alert to the service, the authorities or a personal contact if something goes wrong.

Gilani said Safr pays drivers better than Uber or Lyft, adding that this is possible because Safr charges smaller commissions and higher fares.

The pitch seems to be working. Safr already has signed up about 6,000 drivers in Massachusetts, about 95 percent of whom are women, Gilani said. He said 40 percent are first-time ride-hailing drivers.

â€œWe want to make sure the woman can drive safely without any concern, and women can take a ride without any safety concerns,â€ Gilani said. â€œWe are not discriminating against anybody. But we also understand there is a market segment that wants an option.â€

Safr â€” whose imminent arrival was first reported by DCist â€” may be an improvement over Chariot for Women, and Gilani sounds sincere in his view that this service will help and empower women. But it still seems like a bad idea.

Gilani talks about empowering women and involving men in that empowerment somehow, but the entire thrust of Safr is about creating a gender-biased service of women providing public transportation mostly, if not solely, for other women. Itâ€™s couched in the softer language of preference, instead of exclusion â€” as if gender preferences werenâ€™t the problem in the first place.

Besides entering into the especially charged field of gender politics these days, Safr also seems likely to stir controversy over issues touching on immigration and assimilation. Thatâ€™s because the companyâ€™s target customer appears to be not only women but also women from certain cultures, such as his native Pakistan, who feel uncomfortable when alone in settings with men, Gilani said.

â€œThere is a huge population in the country that comes from Asian countries, South Asia, that wants to have this option and has asked for this option from us,â€ Gilani said.

[New York law capping Uber and Lyft may spread â€” and return focus to congestion pricing]

Safr may be responding to a concern thatâ€™s out of line with reality. A 2016 Pew Research Center study reported that more women than men express concern about the safety of ride-hailing, but the same report also found no significant difference in usage across gender lines.

However admirable its goals, Safr seems to be operating on the assumption that the only way for people to be safe or comfortable is to be with their own kind. And asking for a lift from Point A to Point B on a public transportation service is not the same as getting a deep-tissue massage at the gym or requesting a same-sex security agent for a required pat-down at the airport.

Thereâ€™s perhaps even a whiff of patronization in the notion that the only way to ensure a womanâ€™s safety is to keep her separate from men. And thereâ€™s doublespeak: Though Safrâ€™s appeal rests on choosing a driverâ€™s or riderâ€™s sex, the companyâ€™s website insists Safr isnâ€™t denying service to anyone based on gender.

Ride-hailing and mass transit â€” or just about any public space in society, when you get right down to it â€” could be made safer for women. But the way to do that is not by segregating women.

Learner drivers in Austria will no longer be able to take their theory test in the Turkish language, the transport ministry says.

A minority of prospective drivers take the test in Turkish, but it reportedly remains the second most-popular option.

Transport Minister Norbert Hofer, from the far-right Freedom Party, said the move was aimed at cutting costs.

""Each additional language for training costs the state a five-figure sum that isn't justifiable,"" he said.

But he added that the decision was also intended to be an ""encouragement to learn German.""

""It's naturally a question of costs but also for me it's essential to clearly establish which languages it is sensible to have the exam in,"" he told public radio station Ã–1.

He said candidates will still be able to take the examination in English, Croatian and Slovene.

The anti-immigration Freedom Party secured a number of key posts in Austria's coalition government after last year's elections.

It governs with the conservative People's Party, which makes Austria the only country in Western Europe to have a far-right party in power.

The change to the language options for learner drivers comes amid a prolonged souring of relations between Austria and Turkey.

Chancellor Sebastian Kurz wants the EU to break off Turkey's EU membership negotiations - a stance that has angered Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

In May 2017 that anger led Turkey to veto Nato's co-operation with Austria. The move disrupted Nato's partnership activities with 41 countries.

3YO4AH2FPE25M4365CKHF84YB60Q07,Supreme Court Condemns Ruling That Upheld Japanese-American Internment In WWII,"For the first time, a U.S. Supreme Court decision has denounced the infamous 1944 ruling that supported the constitutionality of Japanese-American incarceration during World War II, calling that ruling ""morally repugnant"" and ""gravely wrong.""

The court's declaration came Tuesday in a decision upholding President Donald Trump's travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries. The president had once likened his ban to President Franklin Roosevelt's discriminatory policies during World War II.

But Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote for the majority, brought up Korematsu v. United States to differentiate it from the ruling in favor of Trump's travel ban.

""Korematsu has nothing to do with this case,"" Roberts wrote, referencing the lawsuit filed by Japanese-American Fred Korematsu, who was arrested for refusing to report to the camps in 1942.

""The forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential authority,"" Roberts stated. ""Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and -- to be clear -- 'has no place in law under the Constitution.'""

Legal experts may argue whether that constitutes an official overturning of the earlier decision, but for all practical and symbolic purposes, Roberts' words mean the Korematsu precedent is gone.

Attorney Dale Minami, who helped overturn Fred Korematsu's conviction for violating the federal order in 1983, described the court's declaration as long overdue, though ""bittersweet.""

""I think Fred would be happy and sad. He'd be happy that the Supreme Court finally did what they should have done in the first place,"" Minami said. ""But at the same time, I think that Fred's vision of civil rights extended beyond his own case."" (Fred Korematsu died in 2005 at the age of 86.)

Minami accused the Supreme Court of having made its decision on Trump's travel ban without adequate evidence. The same mistake led to the court's ruling in favor of prison camps seven decades ago, he said.

In 2011, the U.S. Solicitor General's Office admitted that at the time of the lawsuits filed by Korematsu and fellow Japanese-American Gordon Hirabayashi, it had evidence supporting the argument that the majority of Japanese-Americans did not pose a potential security threat. This evidence was deliberately not submitted to the court, the acting solicitor general said.

I think that Fred's vision of civil rights extended beyond his own case. Dale Minami, the lawyer who helped overturn Fred Korematsu's conviction in 1983

In the case of Trump's travel ban, information was also deliberately withheld from consideration in the lower courts because it was deemed classified.

""It just feeds into this whole sense that now all three branches of government are leaning so far right,"" Minami said.

John Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, also expressed concern that the justices in the current case had ""blindly deferred to the judgment of the executive branch.""

""It's almost ironic or a slap in the face that the Korematsu case was overturned this way,"" he said.

Dissenting justices in Trump v. Hawaii didn't miss this point. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose dissent was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, expressed concern that Trump's policy ""masquerades behind a facade of national-security concerns.""

""In Korematsu, the Court gave 'a pass [to] an odious, gravely injurious racial classification' authorized by an executive order,"" Sotomayor wrote. ""As here, the Government invoked an ill-defined national security threat to justify an exclusionary policy of sweepÂ­ing proportion.""

Attorney Don Tamaki -- who represents the adult children of Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and Minoru Yasui, who also filed a lawsuit against the federal government's targeting of Japanese-Americans -- took a similar view.

""[Sotomayor's] point here is that in 1944, the court just surrendered,"" Tamaki told HuffPost. ""They said if the military government tells us that Japanese-American citizens are dangerous, then we believe the government. It never said, 'Where's the proof?'""

Tamaki warned that when the Supreme Court is willing to look the other way and not demand the full facts, there's an overwhelming temptation to manipulate the evidence.

It's almost ironic or a slap in the face that the Korematsu case was overturned this way. John Yang, president of Asian Americans Advancing Justice

The adult children of Korematsu, Hirabayashi and Yasui all spoke out against the Supreme Court's decision on Tuesday.

""The travel ban is unjust and singles out individuals due to the religion they practice, similar to Executive Order 9066 that unconstitutionally imprisoned my father due to his Japanese ancestry,"" Karen Korematsu, Fred Korematsu's daughter, said in a statement obtained by HuffPost.

Jay Hirabayashi, son of Gordon Hirabayashi, echoed that disappointment: ""The Supreme Court's decision today reaffirms that despite 75 years, xenophobia still reigns true in our country.""

Holly Yasui, daughter of Minoru Yasui, called the court's decision a repeat of history.

""Again, our Court has allowed executive power to go unchecked even though the Muslim travel ban and other immigration policies have clear antecedents of religious and racial animus, as was the case in 1942,"" she said. ""We need to continue to fight for justice. We must never give up!""

The UN's migration agency says Venezuela is heading for the same refugee ""crisis moment"" seen in the Mediterranean in 2015.

The warning comes as its neighbours try to halt the movement of people fleeing Venezuela's economic crisis.

Peru brought in stricter border regulations on Saturday - a day after a court overturned Ecuador's attempt to strengthen its own controls.

More than two million Venezuelans have fled their country since 2014.

They are fleeing a dire economic situation, with Venezuelans facing shortages of food, medicine and basic goods.

Dash to the Peruvian border

Hundreds of Venezuelans were bussed through Ecuador to the Peruvian border before the midnight deadline on Friday.

Jonathan Zambrano, 18, who is at Tumbes on the border between Ecuador and Peru, told news agency AFP he had been on the road for five days along with many others.

More than 2,500 crossed into the small Peruvian border town of Aguas Verdes on Friday, with thousands more trying to reach Peru at the main crossing point at Tumbes.

The Tumbes crossing has seen about 3,000 arrivals per day in recent weeks.

Peru is home to about 400,000 Venezuelan migrants, most of whom arrived in the past year, according to Peru's immigration agency.

The new rules coming into force on Saturday require them to have valid passports. Until now, Venezuelans have been allowed to enter Peru with just their ID cards.

Ecuador brought in a similar law last week. However, on Friday, a judge found requiring Venezuelans to carry valid passports broke regional agreements on freedom of movement.

The state of Roraima, in Brazil's Amazon region, also had its attempt to close the border thrown out by a judge earlier this month.

A hardening attitude towards Venezuelans seeking a new life could also be heard on the streets in Peru.

Giannella Jaramillo, who runs a clothes stall in a town near the border, told AFP: ""On the one hand we're sorry for the Venezuelan people, but they are taking a job away from a Peruvian. It's hard to help more people.""

Her words were echoed by Ecuadoran Gerardo Gutierrez.

""Walk two blocks and you see 10 Venezuelans, walk another two and you see 10 Venezuelans.

""In economically poor countries, it's hard to help more people with what little there is.""

Peruvian Prime Minister CÃ©sar Villanueva has said requiring Venezuelans to show their passport at the border did not mean that Peru was ""closing the door"" on Venezuelan migrants.

He said ID cards did not provide enough information and could easily be forged.

Peruvian Foreign Minister NÃ©stor Popolizio said Venezuelans could apply for visas in Peruvian consulates in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador or even at the border crossing in Tumbes.

Situation 'building to a crisis'

Joel Millman, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), said that all this - as well as recent violence at the border in Brazil - was an early warning sign that the region was in need of help.

""This is building to a crisis moment that we've seen in other parts of the world, particularly in the Mediterranean,"" he told reporters.

""A difficult situation can become a crisis situation very quickly and we have to be prepared,"" he added.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""This is the largest exodus Latin America has experienced"" - UNHCR's Chiara Cardoletti

However, Chiara Cardoletti of the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR), said other countries in the region had welcomed Venezuelans and were helping to ""avoid a situation like the one we have seen in Europe"".

""What we are seeing is a continent that has opened its doors to people who are fleeing and who need support,"" she said.

Ms Cardoletti added that Colombia had registered more than 450,000 Venezuelans and given them regular status. The UN says more than 870,000 Venezuelans are in Colombia, many of them in vulnerable situations.

3BA7SXOG1K8NGUN9DVMWDDKLQH2R82,Meet the Democrats who voted to defend ICE,"One of the many advantages of being the majority party in the House is the ability to make the minority party furious. That was the play behind Wednesdayâ€™s resolution to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a nonbinding measure meant entirely to embarrass Democrats, because some of their most left-wing members want ICE to be abolished, and because at the moment that idea is a loser in the polls.

The left-wingers didnâ€™t bite. Rep. Marc Pocan (D-Wis.), who has sponsored the Houseâ€™s only â€œAbolish ICEâ€ bill, voted â€œpresent,â€ as did most of his Democratic colleagues. Eighteen Democrats voted for the resolution, though â€” and Republicans expected them to. An earlier idea, to bring up Pocanâ€™s bill for a vote, was scrapped after it was seen as an easy â€œnoâ€ vote for Democrats in swing and Senate races.

[House GOP passes measure lauding ICE; Democrats withhold votes in protest]

But those Democrats ended up backing the resolution anyway â€” along with a few others. Because this is probably not the last â€œstuntâ€ vote weâ€™ll see before the midterms, hereâ€™s a guide to the outliers.

The Trump district Democrats

Just a dozen House Democrats represent districts where voters rejected Hillary Clinton in 2016. Half of them voted to support ICE agents: Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.), Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), Rep. Tom Oâ€™Halleran (D-Ariz.), and Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.).

While Gottheimer and Kind have drawn second-tier challengers â€” and while both districts have grown more Democratic since 2016 â€” the other four are in serious races and taking any chance they can to present themselves as pragmatists. Cartwright, in particular, has been attacked at home for his past votes against enhanced immigration law enforcement; his vote Wednesday will nestle next to his vote for â€œKateâ€™s Lawâ€ as he argues that voters in his Lehigh Valley district should not confuse him with those other, more radical Democrats.

The Senate candidates

Rosen is her partyâ€™s nominee for U.S. Senate in Nevada, and Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) is cruising to her partyâ€™s nomination in that state. Both are swing states; both candidates have straddled the line on immigration, attacking the Trump administrationâ€™s enforcement tactics and endorsing the Dream Act while looking for ways to blunt the expected â€œopen bordersâ€ attacks.

The Blue Dogs

Thereâ€™s some more overlap here: Half of the Democratic â€œayesâ€ came from members of the Blue Dog Democratic caucus, which includes Gottheimer, Oâ€™Halleran and Sinema. Just as notable was which Blue Dogs voted present â€” most of their Latino membership, as well as Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D-Ill.), who narrowly held off a left-wing primary challenge in part because of support from Latino voters.

The Safe Seat Holdouts

Just five of the Democratic â€œayeâ€ votes came from Democrats who donâ€™t really identify as conservatives but sometimes break with their left: Rep. Ami Bera (Calif.), Rep. Al Lawson (Fla.), Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (Mass.), Rep. Thomas Suozzi (N.Y.), and Rep. Peter J. Visclosky (Ind.). None is seen as endangered in November. Bera, a three-time target of Republicans, is facing the weakest opponent of his career. Suozzi, who represents the only part of Long Island that got bluer from 2012 to 2016, is also from one of the communities where the president most frequently comes to highlight the danger of gang activity involving undocumented immigrants.

Two of these Democrats, however, are facing primaries. Lynch, who has long been the most conservative member of his stateâ€™s all-Democratic delegation, is facing two challenges from his left, most notably from the game designer and anti-â€œGamergateâ€ activist Brianna Wu. Lawson, who once challenged a Blue Dog Democrat in Florida, is now being opposed from his left, by former Jacksonville mayor Alvin Brown.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/07/18/meet-the-democrats-who-voted-to-defend-ice/,"['Strongly Republican', 'Democratic', 'Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Democratic']","['5', '2', '4', '5', '3']"

The Latest on the influx of migrants into Europe (all times local):

1:10 p.m.

Norway says the number of asylum seekers from Turkey has increased noticeably in recent weeks, and officials say it will take time to process them because Oslo needs to check other countries' practices in similar cases.

Frode Forfang, head of Norway's Directorate of Immigration, says many have claimed political persecution at home because of links to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is blamed by Turkey for the 2016 failed coup.

The agency said that 245 Turkish nationals have sought shelter in Norway so far in 2018, including 142 arriving in June. That compares to a total of 164 Turkish nationals who sought asylum in Norway in 2017.

The agency offered no explanation for the June increase.

Forfang said Thursday that ""most of them"" have been granted protection in the past.

German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer expects ""very difficult"" talks with fellow European Union countries on taking back migrants rejected by Germany.

Seehofer heads to Vienna on Thursday to meet with Austrian government officials to discuss his plan to turn back asylum-seekers who have registered in another EU country.

The plan is in line with existing EU rules, but countries on the bloc's outer borders such as Italy have said they're unwilling to take in all the migrants who arrive on their shores.

The issue has caused deep divisions within Europe since the mass influx of refugees in 2015, and most recently it threatened to split German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government.

Seehofer told Parliament that ""they will be very difficult talks"" and ""there will be no agreements in the first round.""

3VP28W7DUO25X0JNVQMF9836MZWFZS,The Daily 202: Russia imbroglio deepens the disconnect between Trump and his own administration,"With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve

THE BIG IDEA: President Trump found himself at odds on Wednesday with his own people who work at Foggy Bottom, Fort Meade, Langley, the Pentagon and the brutalist J. Edgar Hoover Building.

At the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado last night, FBI Director Christopher Wray responded to Trumpâ€™s wishy-washy and inconsistent statements about festering Russian interference in the American political system.

â€œHeâ€™s got his view. Heâ€™s expressed his view,â€ Wray said. â€œThe intelligence communityâ€™s assessment has not changed. My view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and that it continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.â€

Wray, who Trump tapped after he fired James Comey, defended the ongoing federal investigation into whether the president obstructed justice and whether his 2016 campaign colluded with the Kremlin. â€œI do not believe special counsel [Robert] Mueller is on a â€˜witch hunt,â€™â€ he said. â€œI think it's a professional investigation conducted by a man that I've known to be a straight shooter.â€

NBC anchor Lester Holt asked if heâ€™s ever considered resigning, as has been reported. Wray did not say no. â€œI'm a low-key, understated guy, but that should not be mistaken for what my spine is made out of,â€ he said. â€œI'll just leave it at that.â€

It was a stunning ending to another stunning day. Columnist Karen Tumulty calls whatâ€™s transpired since Trump left Finland his â€œworst moment since Charlottesville.â€

Earlier Wednesday, the president said â€œnoâ€ twice when a reporter asked him if he believes Russia continues to target the United States. That directly conflicts with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coatsâ€™s declaration last week that â€œthe warning lights are blinking red again,â€ comparing the threat matrix to the eve of the Sept. 11 attacks. Coats, a longtime Republican senator from Indiana, said during another appearance on Monday that Russiaâ€™s efforts to undermine U.S. democracy are â€œongoing and pervasive.â€

Two hours later, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders argued that the president was actually just saying â€œnoâ€ to taking questions, not that he was regurgitating Vladimir Putinâ€™s talking points or retracting his post-Helsinki retraction. In fact, Trump continued to take questions from reporters after answering â€œno.â€ The ABC News correspondent who asked Trump the original question pushed back on Sandersâ€™s spin.

From the ABC News reporter who asked Trump about ongoing election interference:

Getting a lot of questions about my exchange with @realDonaldTrump today.

Yes, he was looking directly at me when he spoke.

Yes, I believe he heard me clearly. He answered two of my questions.

Hereâ€™s the full exchange: pic.twitter.com/F3QmDSFzpT â€” Cecilia Vega (@CeciliaVega) July 18, 2018

Fox News didnâ€™t buy it either. A chyron on the presidentâ€™s favorite channel blared: â€œTry, try again: White House and Trump offer different responses on Russia.â€

TRUMP VS. THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY:

-- During an interview that aired on the â€œCBS Evening Newsâ€ a few hours later, Trump claimed that he pushed Putin hard on election interference in private before backing off and accepting his denials during the news conference. Asked if he holds Putin personally responsible for Russiaâ€™s election interference, the president replied: â€œWell, I would, because he's in charge of the country. Just like I consider myself to be responsible for things that happen in this country. So, certainly, as the leader of a country you would have to hold him responsible, yes.â€

Note Trumpâ€™s use of the word â€œwouldâ€ in his response. He didnâ€™t say, â€œI do hold him responsible.â€ Or, â€œI will hold him responsible.â€ The use of the word â€œwouldâ€ conveys that Trump still refuses to admit Russia interfered, despite reading the statement on Tuesday saying that he accepts the conclusion of the U.S. intelligence community.

Asked by CBS whether he agrees with Coatsâ€™s assessment, Trump said: â€œWell, Iâ€™d accept it. I mean, heâ€™s an expert. This is what he does. Heâ€™s been doing a very good job. I have tremendous faith in Daniel Coats. And if he says that, I would accept that. I will tell you, though, it better not be. It better not be.â€

At the risk of being repetitive, Coats has said it â€” repeatedly and publicly. For whatever reason, Trump does not sound like someone who accepts what heâ€™s been told. Moreover, Trump has been hearing it for a long time in private.

To wit, todayâ€™s New York Times reports that, two weeks before his inauguration, Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that Putin personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election. â€œThe evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation,â€ per David Sanger and Matthew Rosenberg. â€œMr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.â€

TRUMP VS. THE PENTAGON:

-- The military appears to be out of the loop. Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, told reporters in Moscow yesterday that â€œimportant verbal agreementsâ€ were reached on a series of national security issues when the two leaders met one-on-one in Helsinki for more than two hours, joined only by translators. He mentioned the preservation of the New Start and INF arms control treaties and said Putin made â€œspecific and interesting proposalsâ€ related to Syria.

â€œBut officials at the most senior levels across the U.S. military â€¦ had little to no information Wednesday,â€ Karen DeYoung, Missy Ryan and Anton Troianovski report. â€œAt the Pentagon, as press officers remained unable to answer media questions about how the summit might impact the military, the paucity of information exposed an awkward gap in internal administration communications. â€¦ Defense Secretary Jim Mattis did not attend Wednesdayâ€™s Cabinet meeting with Trump and has not appeared in public this week or commented on the summit. â€¦

â€œThe uncertainty surrounding Moscowâ€™s suggestion of some sort of new arrangement or proposal regarding Syria, in particular, was striking because Gen. Joseph Votel, who heads U.S. Central Command, is scheduled to brief reporters on Syria and other matters Thursday. â€¦ Nonmilitary officials who were provided minimal, indirect readouts expressed confidence that no agreement had been struck with Putin on Syria, and that Trump â€” who early this year expressed a desire to withdraw all U.S. troops from that country â€” made clear to Putin that no American departure was imminent.

â€œSome military officials, accustomed a year and a half into the Trump administration to a decision-making process that is far less structured than it was under President Barack Obama, appeared unfazed by the lack of clarity. Unlike Obama, who oversaw a national security process that was famously meticulous and often slow, Trump has presided over a more fluid, less formally deliberative system. Few if any top-level national security meetings, for example, have been held this spring following the administrationâ€™s attack on Syrian military facilities in April â€¦ That shift â€¦ may provide top military officials less regular access to their commander in chief and fewer opportunities to influence the policy process.â€

TRUMP VS. THE FOREIGN SERVICE:

-- Perhaps the wildest moment of Wednesday came when Sanders said during her White House briefing that Trump has not ruled out a request from Putin to let Russian authorities interrogate Michael McFaul, the former U.S. ambassador to Russia under Obama. â€œThe president is going to meet with his team, and we'll let you know when we have an announcement on that,â€ she said. â€œThere was some conversation about it, but there wasn't a commitment made on behalf of the United States. And the president will work with his team, and we'll let you know if there's an announcement on that front.â€

â€œAllowing the interrogation of a former American ambassador, who held diplomatic immunity while in Moscow, would be an unprecedented breach in protections traditionally provided to the nationâ€™s foreign service,â€ Bloomberg Newsâ€™s Toluse Olorunnipa notes. â€œIn exchange for the opportunity to have McFaul and a number of other Americans questioned, the Russian president offered to let [Mueller] observe interrogations of 12 Russian intelligence agents indicted by a U.S. grand jury last week.â€

-- State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters that letting a former diplomat be questioned â€œwould be a grave concern to our former colleagues.â€ She added that â€œRussian assertions are absolutely absurd at this pointâ€ vis-a-vis the 11 U.S. citizens that Putin wants access to.

-- Current and former U.S. diplomats expressed horror and disgust at the White Houseâ€™s refusal to flatly rule out handing over McFaul, who has long been a bÃªte noire of Putin. â€œOne serving diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was â€˜at a â€¦ lossâ€™ over comments that can be expected to chill American diplomacy in hostile or authoritarian countries â€” a comment echoed by former State Department officials as well,â€ the Daily Beastâ€™s Spencer Ackerman reports. â€œItâ€™s beyond disgraceful,â€ the current U.S. diplomat said. â€œItâ€™s fundamentally ignorant with regard to how we conduct diplomacy or what that means. It really puts in jeopardy the professional independence of diplomats anywhere in the world, if the consequence of their actions is going to be potentially being turned over to a foreign government.â€ (There are many similar reactions in the Social Media Speed Read below.)

-- McFaul, a political-science professor at Stanford and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, said he hopes â€œthe White House corrects the record and denounces in categorical terms this ridiculous request from Putin.â€

I hope the White House corrects the record and denounces in categorical terms this ridiculous request from Putin. Not doing so creates moral equivalency between a legitimacy US indictment of Russian intelligence officers and a crazy, completely fabricated story invented by Putin https://t.co/K1ZvrNwTu3 â€” Michael McFaul (@McFaul) July 18, 2018

July 17, 2018. Donald TrumpPresident of the United States Mr Trump, you invented and speak a lot about ""fake... Posted by Anthony Maslin on Tuesday, July 17, 2018

-- One of the most scathing condemnations of Trumpâ€™s posture toward Putin this week came from a grieving father in Perth, Australia. â€œFour years ago, on July 17, 2014, Anthony Maslin and Rin Norris lost all three of their children, who were among the 298 passengers on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur,â€ Rebecca Tan reports. â€œThe flight was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing Norris's father, the three Maslin children â€” 12-year-old Mo, 10-year-old Evie and 8-year-old Otis â€” and all the other passengers. An investigation led by the Netherlands has since found evidence that points toward Russia having â€˜direct involvementâ€™ in the plane's downing.â€ (Putin has denied that the Kremlin was in any way responsible.)

In a Facebook post, Maslin wrote: â€œIt's not anger that I feel towards the two of you. Itâ€™s something much, much worse. It's pity. You have no empathy for your fellow man, and you clearly have no idea what love is. So you have nothing.â€

WILL CONGRESS ACT?

-- Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) introduced a nonbinding resolution yesterday. It would commend the Justice Department for its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, reaffirm the intelligence communityâ€™s assessment that the Kremlin interfered and say that Moscow must be held accountable (without specifying how). Theyâ€™re hoping that it can pass by unanimous consent today.

-- â€œThreats from Republican lawmakers about confronting the president or pushing bills to punish Russia for further election interference are ringing hollow inside the White House, which has grown accustomed to panic, followed by inaction, on Capitol Hill,â€ Politicoâ€™s Burgess Everett and Eliana Johnson report. â€œA number of hawkish senators alarmed by the presidentâ€™s remarks have yet to hear from chief of staff John Kelly, who frequently reassures nervous Republicans, and some senators are barreling forward with efforts to combat Russian interference in the fall elections. Increasingly, they view their own efforts to blunt Russia as distinctly separate from whatever Trump or his administration is doing or saying at any given time.â€

-- House Republicans are trying to cut funding for election security grants from a spending bill that lawmakers will vote on today. Erica Werner reports: â€œAt issue is a grants program overseen by the federal Election Assistance Commission and aimed at helping states administer their elections and improve voting systems; Democrats want to continue grant funding through 2019, while Republicans say the program already has been fully funded. Republicans argued strenuously in floor debate Wednesday that states had plenty of money from prior congressional allocations to spend on election improvements. But Democrats accused the Republicans of abetting [Trump] in his refusal to take a hard line against [Putin] at this weekâ€™s summit in Helsinki.â€

-- Most states are not planning on upgrading their election security systems before the midterms, despite having federal money to do so. Politicoâ€™s Eric Geller reports: â€œOnly 13 states said they intend to use the federal dollars to buy new voting machines. At least 22 said they have no plans to replace their machines before the election â€” including all five states that rely solely on paperless electronic voting devices, which cybersecurity experts consider a top vulnerability. In addition, almost no states conduct robust, statistic-based post-election audits to look for evidence of tampering after the fact. And fewer than one-third of states and territories have requested a key type of security review from the Department of Homeland Security.â€

Maria Butina speaks to a crowd during a 2013 rally in support of legalizing the possession of handguns in Moscow. (AP)

THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- U.S. prosecutors said that Maria Butina, the Russian national arrested on charges of being a foreign agent, had ties to Russian intelligence operatives, with whom she remained in contact during her time in the United States. Tom Jackman and Rosalind S. Helderman report: â€œButina, 29, also cultivated a â€˜personal relationshipâ€™ with an American Republican consultant as part of her cover and offered sex to at least one other person â€˜in exchange for a position within a special interest organization,â€™ according to a court filing. After a hearing on Wednesday afternoon, U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson denied Butinaâ€™s request to be released on bail, finding that no combination of conditions would ensure her return to court. â€¦ The new allegations laid out Wednesday explicitly link Butina to Russiaâ€™s intelligence services for the first time, painting the portrait of a covert agent backed by powerful patrons who created a pretext for her presence in the United States.

â€œIn a court filing that could have been ripped from the television show â€˜The Americans,â€™ prosecutors described her manipulating a South Dakota political operative as part of her scheme and meeting for a private lunch in March with a Russian diplomat suspected of being a Russian intelligence officer â€” all while FBI agents watched. â€¦ In arguing that she should be released, [Butinaâ€™s lawyer] revealed that Butina had offered to assist law enforcement with a federal criminal investigation of an unidentified person in South Dakota. A description of that personâ€™s activities in court filings matches that of Paul Erickson, a South Dakota political operative with whom Butina was romantically involved.

â€œProsecutors say Butina got help in making contact with influential Americans from Erickson, a political consultant from South Dakota who once helped run Pat Buchananâ€™s presidential campaign and whom Butina met after hosting him and other American gun enthusiasts in Russia in 2013. While the two lived together and had a personal relationship, prosecutors said it was a â€˜duplicitousâ€™ one, saying that they found papers in which the 29-year-old â€˜expressed disdainâ€™ about having to live with 56-year-old Erickson.â€

-- â€œHere is possible Russian political meddling â€” in the flesh,â€ Dana Milbank notes. â€œIn court, DOJ prosecutor Erik Kenerson claimed Butina â€¦ was considered a covert Russian agent by a senior Russian official, believed based on descriptions in the complaint to be Alexander Torshin, deputy director of Russiaâ€™s central bank. â€¦ [Kenerson] displayed a photo of Butina at the Capitol on Trumpâ€™s Inauguration Day, and described an exchange between the two: â€˜Youâ€™re a daredevil girl,â€™ Torshin said in response to the photo. Replied Butina: â€˜Good teachers!â€™ Kenerson said Butina had told the Russian official she was â€˜ready for further orders.â€™â€

-- This isnâ€™t the first time Ericksonâ€™s name has come up in connection with Russia's election interference. In a May 2016 email to Trump campaign adviser Rick Dearborn, Erickson offered to help arrange a back-channel meeting between Trump and Putin. He wrote in the message, which was among a trove of campaign documents handed over to Capitol Hill investigators last year, that Russia was â€œquietly but actively seeking a dialogue with the U.S.â€ and would try to make â€œfirst contactâ€ during the NRAâ€™s annual convention. (New York Times)

-- â€œGetting entangled in the Trump-Russia investigations would be a strange twist of fate for most South Dakotans, but not Paul Erickson. For him, it might have been predictable,â€ the Rapid City Journalâ€™s Seth Tupper wrote in a fantastic profile this February. â€œThe highlights and lowlights of Ericksonâ€™s past include performing as a warmup act for Ronald Reagan; making an anti-communist action movie with Jack Abramoff, who went on to disgrace as a corrupt lobbyist; working as a top staffer in a Pat Buchanan presidential campaign; lobbying for an African dictator; and representing penile detachment victim John Wayne Bobbitt. Through it all, Erickson has used his charm, charisma and connections to build a reputation as â€˜a sort of 'secret master of the political universe' known almost exclusively to the cognoscenti,â€™ in the words of conservative commentator Ralph Benko.â€

-- This is what building a deep cover looks like: â€œMore than three years before she was arrested . . . Butina gave a guest lecture to about a dozen students munching pizza in a setting far removed from the countryâ€™s political world: a public university in Vermillion, S.D.,â€ Eli Rosenberg reports. â€œThe next month she spoke to about 20 business-minded students at a public high school in Sioux Falls. And that summer, she talked to a crowd of teenagers at a politically oriented summer camp organized by South Dakota Republicans. The incidents were documented in bits and pieces at the time â€” on a university flier, in an appreciation posted to social media â€¦ and on Butinaâ€™s own social media profiles. While the majority of attention on the accused spy has focused on her efforts to cultivate relationships in Republican-oriented groups like the [NRA and CPAC], these incidents, far removed from the national political sphere and its nodes of power, give a window into the years of planning and attention to detail that undergird what investigators say was Butinaâ€™s campaign.â€

-- A federal judge denied Paul Manafortâ€™s request to suppress evidence seized from his home. From Reuters: â€œManafortâ€™s lawyers had sought to limit the scope of evidence that prosecutors can rely on for his upcoming September trial in Washington, D.C., claiming that the search warrant was overly broad and unconstitutional. â€˜Given the nature of the investigation, the warrant was not too broad in scope,â€™ wrote Judge Amy Berman Jackson for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in her ruling.â€

-- Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos, who is married to former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, testified before House Democrats. Politicoâ€™s Kyle Cheney reports: â€œ[Papadopoulos] said lawmakers grilled her Wednesday about her husband Georgeâ€™s role in the campaign and that sheâ€™s had no contact with the White House about her call for a presidential pardon for him. Papadopoulos described her four-hour interview with Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee as â€˜very professionalâ€™ and said lawmakers were â€˜kindâ€™ and â€˜receptiveâ€™ to her testimony.â€

Acting Veterans Affairs Secretary Peter O'Rourke appears before a House Veterans Affairs subcommittee on Tuesday. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)

PERSONNEL IS POLICY:

-- Ahead of Robert Wilkieâ€™s expected confirmation as VA Secretary, Trump loyalists have aggressively moved to purge or otherwise reassign career staffers at the agency into lower-profile roles. Lisa Rein reports: â€œThe transfers include more than a dozen career civil servants who have been moved from the leadership suite at VA headquarters and reassigned to lower-visibility roles. The employees served agency leaders, some dating back more than two decades, in crucial support roles that help a new secretary. None say they were given reasons for their reassignments. The moves are being carried out by a small cadre of political appointees led by Acting Secretary Peter Oâ€™Rourke who have consolidated power in the four months since [helping oust David Shulkin]. Other career senior executives with institutional knowledge of VAâ€™s troubled benefits operation also have been sidelined, some to other cities â€¦ A high-ranking executive appointed during the Obama administration to a six-year term quit last week after clashing with Trump aides. Even some Trump appointees have been pushed out for challenging the leadership group.""

-- The Interior Departmentâ€™s inspector general launched a probe into a real estate deal involving a foundation established by Secretary Ryan Zinke. Politicoâ€™s Ben Lefebvre reports: â€œThe inspector generalâ€™s probe will focus on whether Zinke violated conflict of interest laws â€¦ â€˜You expressed special concern about the reported funding by a top executive at Halliburton and assuring decisions that affect the nationâ€™s welfare are not compromised by individual self enrichment,â€™ Deputy Inspector General Mary Kendall wrote to Rep. RaÃºl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee, and other Democrats. â€˜My office opened an investigation into this matter on July 16.â€™ Zinkeâ€™s role at Interior places him as one of the chief regulators overseeing oil and gas drilling activities, including those performed by Halliburton, one of the worldâ€™s largest fracking and offshore drilling services companies.â€

THE TRADE WAR:

-- Trumpâ€™s tariffs on Mexico are already causing layoffs in the United States â€” including at a factory in Poplar Bluff, Mo., where some 100 workers have been laid off in the month since Trumpâ€™s tariffs took effect. â€œWhen a Mexican company bought Mid Continent Nail Corp. in 2012, workers at the factory here feared it was the beginning of the end,â€ Erica Werner and Kevin Sieff report. â€œInstead, Mid Continentâ€™s factory [doubled in size]. . . . But [Trumpâ€™s tariffs] bumped production costs and [prompted] Deacero to reconsider this arrangement. With Mid Continent charging more for nails, orders are down 70 percent from this time a year ago despite a booming construction industry. Company officials say that without relief, the Missouri plant could be out of business by Labor Day â€” or that remaining production could move to Mexico or another country. And so trade restrictions aimed at preventing U.S. jobs from heading to Mexico â€¦ have instead hampered a Mexican companyâ€™s multimillion-dollar effort to create jobs in the United States â€” an unintended consequence of Trumpâ€™s trade war that demonstrates the difficulty of attacking trading partners without hurting workers at home.â€

-- Trump again raised the possibility of auto tariffs during yesterdayâ€™s Cabinet meeting, even as the proposal faces stiff opposition from industry groups and Capitol Hill. The Wall Street Journalâ€™s Chester Dawson and Joshua Zumbrun report: â€œA coalition of foreign and domestic auto companies, along with auto dealers and auto-parts makers, released a letter on Wednesday urging Mr. Trump to refrain from the tariffs. A bipartisan group of 149 House members also urged the president not to move forward with the tariffs. Auto unions were among the few industry players offering qualified support for the tariffs. Still, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Trump threatened â€˜tremendous retributionâ€™ against the European Union, specifically mentioning auto tariffs, if his meeting with EU officials next week doesnâ€™t yield what he considers a fair auto trade deal.â€

-- â€œThere are two reasons to expect that Trumpâ€™s impact on the world order will be lasting,â€ Peter Coy writes in Bloomberg Businessweekâ€™s latest cover story. â€œOne is that his actions are eroding trust among both allies and rivals. Once gone, trust is hard to reestablish, even if the next president turns out to be a devoted internationalist. The other is that he is pushing a boulder downhill â€” the boulder, of course, being nationalism. Like the politicians behind Britainâ€™s â€˜leaveâ€™ campaign, heâ€™s both harnessing and amplifying powerful emotions that tend to drive countries apart and keep them apart. â€¦ If he chose to, Trump really could wreck the international institutions that have been built up since World War II, because the U.S. is their linchpin.â€

-- A handicapper at the Cook Political Report has changed his mind about how Trump's tariffs will affect the midterms:

A few weeks ago I was skeptical Trump tariffs would cost Rs a lot of votes in Midwest/farm CDs. After visiting with a group of MN corn growers last night...less skeptical. â€” Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) July 18, 2018

-- The next front in the trade war? Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said he will launch an investigation into whether limits should be placed on uranium imports in the interest of national security. Steven Mufson reports: â€œ[U]tilities with nuclear plants fear such actions would raise the cost of electricity and nuclear experts said the military already has stockpiles big enough to last for decades. â€˜Our production of uranium necessary for military and electric power has dropped from 49 percent of our consumption to 5 percent,â€™ Ross said in a statement. That change took place over 30 years, he said. Much of the imported uranium comes from friendly nations. In 2017, Canada and Australia provided more than half of U.S. uranium consumption, Commerce said. Russia provided 16 percent.â€

THE IMMIGRATION WARS:

-- The House overwhelmingly approved a resolution in support of ICE, as Republicans attempted to force their Democratic colleagues to take a stance on the agency. Mike DeBonis reports: â€œA handful of Democrats have embraced calls from activists to abolish [ICE] â€¦ Most Democrats, including [Nancy Pelosi] and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, have kept their distance from the effort. That caution was on display Wednesday, as most Democrats voted â€˜presentâ€™ rather than taking a position for or against the resolution sponsored by Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.). The vote was 244 to 35, with 133 Democrats voting present. House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) called the resolution â€˜a sham and a distractionâ€™ on Wednesday after urging Democrats to withhold their votes.â€

-- â€œOne of the many advantages of being the majority party in the House is the ability to make the minority party furious. That was the play behind Wednesdayâ€™s resolution,â€ David Weigel writes. â€œJust a dozen House Democrats represent districts where voters rejected Hillary Clinton in 2016. Half of them voted to support ICE agents: Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.), Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), Rep. Tom Oâ€™Halleran (D-Ariz.), and Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.). While Gottheimer and Kind have drawn second-tier challengers â€” and while both districts have grown more Democratic since 2016 â€” the other four are in serious races and taking any chance they can to present themselves as pragmatists.â€

-- Since Oct. 1, at least 70 infants have been summoned to court for their own deportation proceedings, according to Justice Department data. Christina Jewett and Shefali Luthra of Kaiser Health News report: â€œThese are children who need frequent touching and bonding with a parent and naps every few hours, and some were of breastfeeding age, medical experts say. Theyâ€™re unable to speak and still learning when itâ€™s day versus night. â€¦ The number of infants under age 1 involved has been rising â€” up threefold from 24 infants in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, and 46 infants the year before. The Justice Department data show that a total of 1,500 â€˜unaccompaniedâ€™ children, from newborns to age 3, have been called in to immigration court since Oct. 1, 2015.â€

THE SUPREME COURT:

-- During Brett Kavanaughâ€™s confirmation hearing, Senate Democrats are expected to resurrect questions about what the former Bush White House lawyer knew about the administrationâ€™s â€œenhanced interrogationâ€ policy. Kavanaugh said during his 2006 confirmation to become an appeals court judge that he was â€œnot involvedâ€ in â€œquestions about the rules governing detention of combatants,â€ but that does not pass the smell test for many people who have studied the program and understand how White Houses work. From Michael Kranish: â€œSenate Democrats have never fully accepted Kavanaughâ€™s answers to questions about one of the Bush administrationâ€™s most controversial policies â€¦ Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), whose questions in 2006 elicited Kavanaughâ€™s denial, said in an interview this week that â€˜what he told us under oath is not accurate.â€™ Democrats are seeking Bush White House files to pin down specifics of any Kavanaugh involvement in detainee policy discussions, which could slow the Trump administrationâ€™s hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed before the Supreme Court reconvenes Oct. 1.

â€œKavanaugh was involved in at least one contentious meeting at the Office of White House Counsel in 2002, and two former White House officials detailed his role in interviews this week with The Washington Post. Bush was then developing his policy on detention and interrogation of terrorism suspects, and Kavanaugh was asked to interpret an important question about how the detainee policy was likely to be viewed in a Supreme Court challenge, specifically by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, for whom he had served as a clerk. Kavanaugh weighed in on how he thought Kennedy would vote on whether certain detainees should be denied a chance to be heard and have legal counsel, according to the other participants. Kavanaugh had already been confirmed for the circuit court when the White House meeting became public in a Post report. Democrats including Durbin have sought ever since to question Kavanaugh about whether he misled the Senate Judiciary Committee.â€

-- Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said senators expect to receive â€œat least 1 million pages of documentsâ€ on Kavanaughâ€™s time in the Bush White House and as a GOP political operative. â€œTo properly vet Judge Kavanaugh, the Senate Judiciary Committee needs access to all documents,â€ Feinstein added. But Republicans are hoping to jam Kavanaugh through before key documents are turned over and reviewed by Senate investigators. Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said this week, â€œWeâ€™re not going to sit idly by and allow our Democratic colleagues to draw this out by making unreasonable document demands, which would delay this hearing until well past the election.â€ (Elise Viebeck)

-- Another issue sure to come up during the hearing: Kavanaugh said during a 2016 speech that he wants to â€œput the final nailâ€ in a 1988 Supreme Court ruling that upheld the constitutionality of an independent counsel. CNNâ€™s Manu Raju reports: â€œThat decision, known as Morrison v. Olson, upheld the constitutionality of provisions creating an independent counsel under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act â€” the same statute under which Ken Starr, for whom Kavanaugh worked, investigated President Bill Clinton. The law expired in 1999, when it was replaced by the more modest Justice Department regulation that governs special counsels like Robert Mueller.â€

-- Packing the court: â€œSenate Republicans broke a record on Wednesday for the number of appeals court judges confirmed during a president's first two years,â€ the Hillâ€™s Jordain Carney reports.

THE MIDTERMS:

-- Trump endorsed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp ahead of the stateâ€™s primary runoff election on Tuesday, throwing his weight behind a man who pledged to â€œround up criminal illegalsâ€ in his pickup truck. Felicia Sonmez reports: â€œKemp is in a dead heat with Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle ahead of Tuesdayâ€™s runoff . . . In a tweet, Trump praised Kemp as â€˜tough on crime, strong on the border and illegal immigration.â€™ â€¦ [In] a race in which both candidates have sought to mimic Trumpâ€™s combative style, Kemp â€¦ has drawn notice for some of his boundary-pushing TV ads. One of the ads shows the candidate wielding a chain saw as he declares that heâ€™s ready to â€˜rip up some regulationâ€™ and talking tough on illegal immigration. â€˜Iâ€™ve got a big truck, just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take â€™em home myself,â€™ Kemp says â€¦. In another TV spot â€¦ Kemp points a shotgun at a young man sitting next to him in a room filled with firearms. â€˜Iâ€™m Brian Kemp, this is Jake, a young man interested in one of my daughters,â€™ the candidate says, [prompting the teenager] to list the reasons Kemp is running for governor. At the end of the ad, Kemp tells the teenager, â€˜Weâ€™re going to get along just fine.â€™â€ (I wrote a Big Idea about the race last week.)

-- GOP Rep. Jason Lewis, facing a difficult reelection in a Minnesota congressional district near Minneapolis, questioned why it was unacceptable to call women â€œslutsâ€ in a recently unearthed recording from 2012. Eli Rosenberg reports: â€œSome of Lewisâ€™s remarks followed the uproar after conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh called Sandra Fluke, then a Georgetown Law student hoping to testify to Congress about how her health-care plan would not pay for birth control, â€˜a slutâ€™ in February 2012. Lewis spoke out against the outcry on the syndicated show he hosted the next month. â€˜Well, the thing is, can we call anybody a slut? This is what begs the question,â€™ Lewis said. â€˜But it used to be that women were held to a little bit of a higher standard. We required modesty from women. Now, are we beyond those days where a woman can behave as a slut, but you canâ€™t call her a slut?â€™â€

-- A measure calling for California to be split into three states will no longer appear on the November ballot following a unanimous decision from the stateâ€™s Supreme Court. The court said it acted â€œbecause significant questions have been raised regarding the propositionâ€™s validity and because we conclude that the potential harm in permitting the measure to remain on the ballot outweighs the potential harm in delaying the proposition to a future election.â€ (LA Times)

-- Elon Musk called the head of the Sierra Club to ask for help in beating back criticism over donations the Tesla chief executive made to Republicans. Bloomberg News's Josh Eidelson reports: â€œMusk on Saturday called Michael Brune, the Sierra Clubâ€™s executive director, and asked that he make public more than $6 million in contributions to the group that had been anonymous, Brune wrote in the email. Musk also enlisted Brune to vouch for him on Twitter to quell a firestorm over the billionaireâ€™s $38,900 contribution to a committee that benefits congressional Republicans including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.

2020 WATCH:

-- Trump said in the CBS interview that aired last night that it would be â€œa dreamâ€ to face Joe Biden in 2020. â€œWell, I dream, I dream about Biden. That's a dream. Look, Joe Biden ran three times. He never got more than 1 percent and President Obama took him out of the garbage heap, and everybody was shocked that he did. I'd love to have it be Biden,â€ the president told Jeff Glor. â€œI think I'd like to have any one of those people that we're talking aboutâ€¦You know, there's probably â€“ the group of seven or eight right now. I'd really like to â€“ I'd like to run against any one of them, but Biden never by himself could never do anything.â€

-- Some Democratic states have begun quietly moving from a caucus system to a traditional primary â€” a quiet, but significant, shift that could reshape its nominating process and hamper potential insurgent candidates. BuzzFeed Newsâ€™s Ruby Cramer reports: â€œBy next year, Democrats could see the number of caucus states cut in half. Four states have already moved from a caucus system to a traditional primary â€¦ Party officials say two more states â€” Nebraska and Washington â€” are now considering the same change. And as Democratic Party members prepare to adopt changes to the nominating process at their annual summer meeting next month â€” including a new rule to â€˜encourageâ€™ the use of primaries over caucuses â€˜whenever possibleâ€™ â€” caucus states may face new outside pressure to embrace state-run primaries. The shift could leave just seven caucus states on the nominating calendar. For more than 20 years, Democrats have held caucuses in no fewer than 14 states. The reduction in caucus states could be a critical factor in the 2020 Democratic primary â€” a race expected to attract a record number of candidates.â€

Over Twitter this morning, Trump said Democrats have a â€œdeath wishâ€ in wanting to abolish ICE:

The Democrats have a death wish, in more ways than one - they actually want to abolish ICE. This should cost them heavily in the Midterms. Yesterday, the Republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ICE! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2018

(In fact, most Democrats withheld their votes from the ICE resolution.)

Trump also dismissed news reports as â€œtotal fictionâ€:

The Fake News Media is going Crazy! They make up stories without any backup, sources or proof. Many of the stories written about me, and the good people surrounding me, are total fiction. Problem is, when you complain you just give them more publicity. But Iâ€™ll complain anyway! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2018

The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that Iâ€™ll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2018

And he sold his administrationâ€™s attempts to lower drug prices:

Thank you to Novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs. Likewise to Pfizer. We are making a big push to actually reduce the prices, maybe substantially, on prescription drugs. â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2018

Yesterday, Trump leaned on Turkey to release an American pastor from prison:

A total disgrace that Turkey will not release a respected U.S. Pastor, Andrew Brunson, from prison. He has been held hostage far too long. @RT_Erdogan should do something to free this wonderful Christian husband &amp; father. He has done nothing wrong, and his family needs him! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2018

He also thanked Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.), who included $5 billion in funding for the border wall in a House appropriations bill and is running for reelection in a district Hillary Clinton narrowly won in 2016:

Thank you to Congressman Kevin Yoder! He secured $5 BILLION for Border Security. Now we need Congress to support. Kevin has been strong on Crime, the Border, the 2nd Amendment, and he loves our Military and Vets. @RepKevinYoder has my full and total endorsement! â€” Donald J.

So the idea of the vibrant, glamorous Obamas â€” two of the most famous people in the world â€” living here was a very big deal. Expectations were high. [But instead], the Obamas have created a protective bubble that allows them maximum flexibility and minimum public exposure. â€¦ The Obamas have always been careful about controlling their message, and the code of silence extends to almost every aspect of their social lives: Speak without authorization and you could be exiled from Obamaland. â€˜Please donâ€™t quote me,â€ said one local acquaintance, who then admitted she rarely sees the couple. â€˜Iâ€™m very honored that they are doing well.â€™â€

Just one day after his stunning comments in Helsinki, President Trump attempted to backtrack. In the Finnish capital, standing next to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a news conference, he had cast doubt on the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Back in the White House on Tuesday, however, Trump argued that he had simply misspoken; he read out a statement saying that he did, in fact, accept that Moscow attempted to sway the vote. At least for a moment.

â€œCould be other people also,â€ he added in the very next sentence. â€œA lot of people out there.â€

Not many people in Washington were convinced by Trump's about-face. Since taking office, Trump has repeatedly called into question his own government's investigations into Kremlin interference and dismissed the growing body of evidence linking that intrusion to his election win â€” including a comment from Putin himself on Monday. Since the remarks in Helsinki, moreover, he had been interviewed by Fox News and made no mention of misspeaking. Even his attempted clarification on Tuesday was apparently self-edited into something more defiant.

Trump wrote in big black Sharpie on his printed remarks: â€œTHERE WAS NO COLLUSIONâ€ pic.twitter.com/5wiG4ukGce â€” David P Gelles (@gelles) July 17, 2018

Nor did Trump say anything on Monday about Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea or its role in buttressing the violent excesses of the Syrian regime. That timidity stood in contrast to his sweeping criticism of America's NATO allies in Brussels last week. To many Trump critics, his performances in both cities capped a year and a half of both tacit and overt attacks on the transatlantic alliance.

Trump's behavior was that â€œof a man who wants the alliance to fail,â€ wrote New York Times columnist David Brooks. â€œHis embrace of Putin Monday was a victory dance on the Euro-American tomb.â€

â€œThe Russian President was effectively given a free pass by a sitting U.S. President to continue his hybrid war against the West,â€ wrote Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister. He called on European liberals to rally against Trumpism and its proxies, pointing to a former Trump adviser's efforts to boost far-right populists on the continent. â€œThe battle is now on to defeat Steve Bannon's sick dream of a right-wing populist revolution in Europe and a retreat to the murderous nationalism of Europe's past,â€ he wrote.

It's worth asking, even now, whom Trump sees as his enemy. His political campaign was couched in nativist rhetoric against â€œglobalism,â€ a euphemism for a world of multicultural liberals and business and political elites who he claimed did not have America's interests at heart. Since taking power, he has focused such attacks on real institutions â€” the Democratic Party and civil servants he dubs â€œthe deep stateâ€ at home, and multilateral blocs such as NATO and the European Union overseas.

More broadly, he has shown consistent apathy for the American-built world order that guaranteed U.S. supremacy for decades. â€œIn the postwar world, U.S. policy had four attractive features: it had appealing core values; it was loyal to allies who shared those values; it believed in open and competitive markets; and it underpinned those markets with institutionalized rules,â€ wrote Martin Wolf of the Financial Times. â€œThis system was always incomplete and imperfect. But it was a highly original and attractive approach to the business of running the world.â€

Wolf suggests Trump is bent on rejecting that system, which is often what we are invoking when we refer now to the â€œWestâ€: â€œFor those who believe humanity must transcend its petty differences, these principles were a start. Yet today the U.S. president appears hostile to core American values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law; he feels no loyalty to allies; he rejects open markets; and he despises international institutions. He believes that might makes right.â€

â€œTrump may have diminished U.S. leadership in the world,â€ Russian analyst Maxim Suchkov said to Today's WorldView in Moscow last week, â€œbut he still wants domination.â€

This worldview leads many analysts to suggest that Trump has more in common with autocrats like Putin than with the elected leaders of Europe's major democracies. For critics of American hegemony, who have long argued that its stated values have little to do with its geopolitical actions, Trump has confirmed their beliefs.

â€œThat reduces the U.S. from being the leader of the free world to being just another grasping great power,â€ Daniel Fried, a former U.S. diplomat and fellow at the Atlantic Council, said to my colleagues David Nakamura and Carol Morello. It â€œundoes 100 years of Americaâ€™s grand strategy,â€ he added, â€œwhich worked out well for us. It won the Cold War, because people behind the Iron Curtain were inspired by our ideas and ideals.â€

Trump 0 â€“ Putin 1

Todayâ€™s front story of Finnish newspaper in Helsinki. #Kauppalehti pic.twitter.com/W3sfeydDo1 â€” Mia (@thepaperword) July 17, 2018

Instead, Trump champions another vision. As we've written before, Trump's conception of the West is cultural, not political. It's anchored in blood-and-soil rhetoric and anger against immigration. Just last week, he argued in Brussels that new migrant arrivals are â€œvery bad for Europeâ€ because they are â€œchanging the culture.â€

A host of mainstream European politicians would disagree, as would the majority of their populations. A new Pew survey of eight Western European countries, published this month, found that 66 percent of those polled believe immigrants make their societies stronger.

But Trump sees this openness â€” and the prospect of a more integrated, diverse Europe â€” as a weakness. Here again, he makes himself a kindred spirit with Putin, another outsider standing skeptically at the door of the liberal West. â€œUntil 2014, Russia used to see itself as the easternmost bus stop of the Western world,â€ Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said to the Wall Street Journal. â€œSince then, there has been a fundamental shift and Russia has turned inward. The Russian elite and its leader, Putin, have come to the conclusion that attempting to become part of the West wonâ€™t lead to desired results.â€

This involves an attempt to turn east and cultivate deeper ties with Asia. But it has also seen the Kremlin build links with the same European far-right populists that Trump has celebrated. Matteo Salvini, Italyâ€™s interior minister and far-right leader, is pushing for the end of E.U. sanctions on Russia. Putin, meanwhile, has cultivated a global image as a preeminent Christian nationalist leader and is cheered by white supremacists in the United States.

The governments Putin and Trump lead may be at odds, but the two men themselves, argued journalist Leonid Ragozin, are on â€œthe same side of the divide.â€ They represent â€œthe same strain of a rising global culture: that of viciously xenophobic tabloids, politically biased infotainment TV, tacky showbiz, irresponsible populism, rabid nativism, and oligarchic kleptocracy,â€ he wrote for BuzzFeed News.

And their bewildered adversaries, now led by a hobbled Europe, are struggling to cope.

Martha McSally will win the Republican Senate nomination in Arizona, CNN projects, fending off a challenge from two hard-line conservatives and providing ambitious moderates in the GOP ranks a playbook to thrive in the Donald Trump era.

McSally defeated former state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio in a race that was overshadowed in recent days by the death of Arizona's Sen. John McCain.

She'll face Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema in a marquee match-up for the seat, which became vacant when Arizona's other Republican senator and intra-party Trump critic, Jeff Flake, announced he would retire rather than likely lose a primary over his criticism of the President.

McSally -- who sharply criticized Trump when the ""Access Hollywood"" tape that captured him making lewd remarks about women was released in 2016 -- closely aligned herself with him on issues like immigration during her Senate primary run. Her win in the last competitive primary on 2018's Senate battleground map is a major relief for Republicans who have watched Sinema spend millions of dollars on TV ads branding herself as a centrist who would ""end the partisan nonsense and protect Arizonans"" on issues like health care while Republicans went through a grueling primary.

Trump didn't endorse in the race, but he gave McSally a shout-out at a recent event at Fort Drum in New York. He noted that she is ""not only an Air Force veteran, but the first woman ever to fly a fighter jet in combat in US history.""

""And I got to know her very well, and she is terrific: Congresswoman Martha McSally,"" Trump said.

In the race's final days, both Ward and Arpaio set off controversy related to their handling of McCain's illness and death. Ward suggested on Facebook that a statement released Friday announcing McCain was ending medical treatment for brain cancer was timed to damage her campaign. Then, on Monday, she tweeted -- in what she later denied was a reference to McCain's illness -- that ""Political correctness is like a cancer!"" Arpaio, meanwhile, complained that he offered McCain's family condolences only to find that Cindy McCain had blocked him on Twitter.

Progressive Gillum wins a stunner in Florida

Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum will win the Democratic nomination for governor of Florida, CNN projects, scoring a major victory for the party's progressive wing while taking another step toward becoming the state's first black chief executive.

Backed by Vermont's independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and a coalition of progressive groups, Gillum upset former Rep. Gwen Graham, who had led in the polls for most of the campaign. He led a field of five competitive candidates in which he was the only non-millionaire -- and only supporter of ""Medicare for all"" single-payer health care. Gillum is the first black candidate to win a major-party gubernatorial nomination in Florida.

His victory sets up Florida, the biggest swing state in presidential elections, as a major test of the political atmosphere this fall. Gillum will face Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Trump-endorsed Republican, in a race that pits two 39-year-olds, who in many ways mirror their parties' national moods, against each other.

DeSantis defeated Adam Putnam, the state agriculture commissioner, CNN projects. His win was expected -- but Putnam had entered the race as the establishment favorite and raised more money than DeSantis. DeSantis' victory proved the power of Trump's endorsement in swaying GOP primary voters.

Gillum's victory, though, came as a stunner in a wide-open contest. Democrats in the race, including billionaire Jeff Greene and wealthy former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine, spent more than $100 million for the chance to wrest back control of the governor's mansion, which has been in Republican hands for two decades. Gillum got a late boost when liberal megadonors Tom Steyer and George Soros led a group that donated $650,000 to his affiliated political action committee.

The governor's race is one of two major statewide contests in Florida in November's midterm elections.

In the other, CNN projects that Florida Gov. Rick Scott will win the Republican Senate primary to face incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for a seat Democrats must hold if they hope to have a shot at the Senate majority.

Steve Farley and Kelly Fryer, the CEO of the YWCA Southern Arizona, for the Democratic nomination in a traditionally red state that has shifted to the left in recent years: Hillary Clinton lost there by just 4 percentage points.

The primary comes days before Ducey faces a major decision: who to appoint to fill McCain's seat. He'll have to choose between a Trump-like Republican and someone in the McCain mold -- or could try to bridge the gap, potentially with a placeholder pick.

In Oklahoma, Democratic state Attorney General Drew Edmondson will face Republican Tulsa businessman Kevin Stitt, who CNN projects will defeat Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett for the seat being vacated by unpopular, term-limited Gov. Mary Fallin.

Arizona and Florida also each have several primaries for House seats that are expected to be competitive in November's midterm elections.

Trump dominant in Arizona Senate primary

The Arizona Senate GOP primary underscored how the Republican Party in Arizona has shifted from one where McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, reigned supreme to one where Trump is the dominant force.

All three GOP candidates cozied up to the President. McSally, in particular, dropped her 2016 campaign criticism of Trump and aligned herself closely with the President.

Arpaio was competing for the same group of die-hard conservative voters as Ward, meaning that his presence in the race has cut directly into her support and undercut conservatives' hopes of beating McSally.

National Republicans see the Arizona US Senate race as crucial to keeping their majority, and think McSally is the only candidate that gives them a chance to win the race. Until recent weeks, they'd been frustrated she had not put the primary away.

But McSally found her footing with an onslaught of TV ads late in the race.

She aired an ad featuring Trump calling her the ""real deal."" She withdrew her co-sponsorship of a bill that offered ""Dreamers"" a path to citizenship, and she mimicked Trump's attacks on ""chain migration."" She became a fixture on Fox News, where she aligned herself with Trump and heaped praise on the President.

And she cast Ward -- who'd launched her campaign as a strident critic of Flake and McCain, a Trump opponent, with the backing of then-White House chief strategist Steve Bannon -- as a Trump critic.

""McSally did a masterful job capitalizing on Ward's 'phonyisms,' "" said Robert Graham, a former Arizona Republican Party chairman who is a Trump ally. ""The religious right freaked and abandoned her and the immigration people consider her soft.""

An anti-Ward super PAC spent more than $4 million on at times misleading ads that cast her as weak on immigration enforcement and opposing Trump's calls for increased military spending.

McSally's campaign, meanwhile, aired an ad asserting that Ward ""doesn't support President Trump"" on immigration. It highlighted Ward's opposition to a Trump-backed bill that Ward labeled ""amnesty.""

Another key moment came in a late-July editorial board meeting at The Arizona Republic -- the only time McSally and Ward would debate, with Arpaio declining the invitation -- on the topic of abortion. Both said they want Roe v. Wade repealed, but Ward called for a ""more incremental"" approach, including a ban on abortions after 24 weeks, while McSally said she favors banning abortion in all cases except rape, incest and when the woman's life is in jeopardy.

Ward also said abortion is debated ""in a fashion that was designed to raise money for people on both sides of the issue.""

The comments alienated anti-abortion activists who were a key part of the conservative constituency a McSally challenger would have needed.

Then, late in the campaign, Ward courted controversy when she invited Mike Cernovich -- a far-right commentator who promoted the infamous ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy theory -- on her bus tour, and then told NBC News that ""attaching those things to me is ridiculous.""

Explaining her decision to invite Cernovich, Ward said: ""We need to have a hook to get you guys interested in seeing the bus tour.""

Ward apologized Monday for a Facebook comment a few days previously suggesting an announcement by McCain's family that he would end his cancer treatment was designed to hurt her campaign, saying her comment had been misinterpreted.

Arpaio, meanwhile, watched his campaign descend into chaos. The Federal Election Commission laid out a host of problems with his first-quarter campaign finance report in a letter to his campaign. And longtime consultant Chad Willems, who until recently was Arpaio's campaign manager, was receiving the vast majority of the $1.3 million raised for the campaign. Arpaio's campaign ended in a fizzle, while Ward attracted headlines as the anti-establishment candidate.

""McSally proved to voters for months that she has the ability to laser-focus in on Sinema's weaknesses in a way that highlights her own strengths, even while facing competitors in a primary,"" said Brian Anderson, an Arizona GOP strategist and former aide to Ducey.

""Kelli Ward continued to remind everyone,"" Anderson said, ""that she's a ticking time bomb who can't talk her way through a question about Pizzagate -- let alone face an opponent like Sinema.""",https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/28/politics/arizona-florida-primary-senate-governor/index.html,"['Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Republican', 'Neutral', 'Republican']","['3', '1', '3', '1', '4']"

3VCK0Q0PO6WKJ7QEPKS0BE9T6VE0NV,"Midwest ICE raids targeted businesses that hired, mistreated illegal immigrants, officials say","Arresting 147, a federal law enforcement operation â€” one of the largest in Homeland Security Investigationsâ€™ 15-year history â€” targeted Midwestern businesses that officials say knowingly hired â€” and mistreated â€” illegal immigrants.

The focus of the operation was unusual in that it targeted business operators for arrest. Most immigration raids have targeted workers suspected of being in the country illegally.

â€œThe whole investigation was initiated, basically, because we knew that these businesses were cheating these workers and cheating taxpayers and cheating their competition,â€ Special Agent in Charge Tracy J. Cormier, HSI St. Paul, which oversees Nebraska and Minnesota, said.

The investigative arm of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement â€” Homeland Security Investigations â€” led the operation in Nebraska and Minnesota that saw about a dozen businesses and plants raided and 17 business owners and managers indicted for fraud, wire fraud and money laundering.

Of those, 14 were taken into custody Wednesday and three were still being sought. Authorities also arrested more than 130 workers at various businesses, busing them to Grand Island, Nebraska, to be questioned and processed.

â€œThe job magnet in the United States is primarily what draws illegal aliens across our borders,â€ said Cormier in a statement posted to ICEâ€™s website. â€œThis HSI-led criminal investigation has shown that these targeted businesses were knowingly hiring illegal workers to unlawfully line their own pockets by cheating the workers, cheating the taxpayers, and cheating their business competitors.â€

The businesses engaged in a scheme that used fraudulent names and Social Security numbers to employ people in the country illegally, she said. The businesses used â€œforce, fraud, coercion, threat of arrest and/or deportationâ€ to exploit the workers, Cormier said. The business that hired out the immigrants also forced the workers to cash their paychecks with that business for an exorbitant fee, officials said, and withheld taxes from workersâ€™ pay without paying those taxes to the government.

â€œIt kind of reminds us of the revival of the old â€˜company storeâ€™ policy, where it used to keep the coal miners indebted to the company for all kinds of services ... like check cashing,â€ she said.

Between 350 and 400 federal, state and local law enforcement officers worked together on the arrests, Cormier said.

Most of the arrests took place in northern Nebraska and southern Minnesota.

Several of the businesses were in Oâ€™Neill, Nebraska, a town of about 3,000 about 160 miles northwest of Omaha. Officials said they were still looking to take three owners or managers into custody as part of the operation.

Also arrested were 133 workers suspected of being in the country illegally, according to ICE. Some will be issued notices to appear before an immigration judge and released, while those with criminal backgrounds will remain in ICE custody, officials said.

The raids come as President Trumpâ€™s administration has been carrying out high-profile immigration enforcement actions against employers.

Dozens of workers were arrested at a meatpacking plant in rural Tennessee in April, followed by agents rounding up more than 100 employees two months later at an Ohio gardening and landscaping company.

Immigration officials also have beefed up audits of companies to verify their employees are authorized to work in the country.

Officials opened nearly 5,300 employer audits since January, many after audits at 100 7-Eleven franchises in 17 states in January.

Pork producing giant Christensen Farms saw search warrants served at its headquarters in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, its truck wash facility in Appleton, Minnesota and a producer plant in Atkinson, Nebraska. Spokeswoman Amber Portner said the company was cooperating with agents. She said she knew of no arrests at any of the companyâ€™s locations Wednesday.

Other businesses raided were in Stromsburg, Ainsworth, Bartlett and Royal, all in Nebraska.

Civil rights organizations in Nebraska were quick to denounce Wednesdayâ€™s operation.

â€œThe ACLU condemns this ongoing campaign of misery that targets immigrants, disrupts local businesses and separates families,â€ Rose Godinez, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, said in a written statement released Wednesday morning.

The effect of such operations are the same whether they target businesses or immigrants, said Jeff Sheldon, spokesman for advocacy group Nebraska Appleseed.

â€œThis is going to leave widespread fear and damage in the community,â€ he said. â€œYou got businesses that are directly affected. Youâ€™ve got neighborhoods that are directly affected. Youâ€™ll have kids tonight coming home to a house where one or more of their parents are gone. This is pain that can last for generations.â€

37PGLWGSJUOUIWMRWXPQPQSLY7HIKK,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez win stuns Democrats, puts new attention on Pelosi","Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a former campaign organizer for Bernie Sanders, pulled off a stunning upset in New York City on Tuesday by defeating Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., a member of party leadership who was considered all but a shoo-in.

Crowley, 56, a 10-term incumbent from Queens and fierce Trump-basher, was a steady fundraiser for fellow Democrats and was thought by some to be a future speaker of the House.

His defeat left no clear potential choice in the House to succeed Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as the party's leader. Further, it exposed deepening divisions within the party as the liberal wing flexes its muscles in the primaries -- pressuring the establishment to back big-government policies like Medicare for All and guaranteed jobs.

There were times that Crowley's campaign in New Yorkâ€™s 14th Congressional District showed signs of fragility. The New York Times editorial page, after his loss, reported that he ran a lackluster campaign that bordered on complacency. The paper pointed out that he debated his opponent only once.

Ocasio-Cortez, 28, who is from the Bronx, is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and ran a low-budget campaign where she was outspent by an 18-1 margin.

""We have had our country on autopilot and weâ€™ve been accepting whatâ€™s been happening,"" she told Refinery29 earlier this month. ""And what's happening in this country is indicative that we need new leadership. We need new leadership in the Democratic Party and we need new leadership in the country.""

Among her issues is expanding the Medicare program to people of all ages and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). She recently went to Tornillo, Texas, to protest against policies that have separated parents from their children at the U.S.-Mexico border.

â€œWe beat a machine with a movement, and that is what we have done today,â€ Ocasio-Cortez said. â€œWorking-class Americans want a clear champion and there is nothing radical about moral clarity in 2018.â€

Her win drew comparisons to when then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Republican, lost to unknown Dave Brat in 2014, and raised questions for Pelosi.

â€œIn the short term, Pelosi may have crossed another potential challenger off of her list, but the bigger picture canâ€™t be good for the existing Democratic leadership structure,â€ Jim Newell wrote in Slate. â€œCrowley, for all his accumulated power, just got taken out on the mantra of generational change. This presents an argument, for Pelosiâ€™s detractors in the conference, that the rest of the leadership should follow suit.â€

Politico wrote that although a rival to Pelosi was defeated, Ocasio-Cortez represents a â€œreminder of the generational demands for change at the top of the party hierarchy,â€ and her victory will likely send a â€œshudder through the moderate wing of the party.â€

The National Republican Campaign Committee celebrated the defeat of ""poor Joe Crowley.""

""House Democrats, hoping for a post-Pelsoi era, are now left leaderless,"" NRCC spokesman Matt Gorman said. ""The only person happier tonight than Nancy Pelosi is the NRCC.""

Pelosi, for her part, described Crowley as ""an unwavering champion for Americaâ€™s working families for almost two decades"" who ""brought principled, unifying and forward-looking leadership to the historic challenges of the Trump Administration"" as the Democratic caucus chair.

""I salute Chairman Crowley for a formidable legacy of achievement for the people of New York,"" Pelosi concluded. ""I congratulate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on her victory.""

37Y5RYYI0QNPWAOU0SYTJM6A3EYSXB,Resistance Alone Won't Save Us. We Need Radical Action.,"In the wake of the Trump administrationâ€™s decision to incarcerate thousands of immigrant children after they were forcibly separated from their parents, a new wave of protests targeting administration officials has taken shape.

After denying that any family separation policy was in effect, a straightforward lie, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was protested at a Mexican restaurant in Washington, D.C. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who lies to the press and the American people every time she holds a so-called briefing, was asked to leave by the co-owner of a restaurant in the western part of Virginia.

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) added fuel to the fire, calling on citizens to â€œcreate a crowd and push backâ€ on any member of the Trump Cabinet they see in public.

President Donald Trump responded on Twitter, calling Waters â€œan extraordinarily low IQ person.â€

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called for â€œunity from sea to shining sea.â€

And now, Waters has been forced to cancel events this weekend after receiving death threats.

Time and again, we are witnessing the conventional political world struggle to coexist with an unconventional president willing to use any means necessary to impose his will on the United States. The result has been an uninspiring and ineffective resistance to the Trump agenda. Using conventional tactics to try and stop this unconventional presidency is a recipe for failure.

Time and again, we are witnessing the conventional political world struggle to coexist with an unconventional president willing to use any means necessary to impose his will on the United States.

Organized marches like the Womenâ€™s March, the March for Our Lives or this weekendâ€™s Families Belong Together are terrific, but that cannot be the full measure of our pushback against the cult of Trump.

Actions like Thursdayâ€™s demonstration in Washington, where hundreds of women were arrested at the Capitol to protest migrant family separations, are a good start. We need more spontaneous acts of civil disobedience. More boycotts. More strikes. More disruptions. More than marching on the weekend.

In the 500-plus days that Trump has occupied the Oval Office, our country has endured an all-out assault on the Constitution.

After meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un, Trump declared that the media, is â€œour countryâ€™s biggest enemy.â€ Trump started a war with NFL players after they exercised their constitutionally protected rights to protest racism in America by refusing to stand for the national anthem. And earlier this week, Trump called for the suspension of due process in immigration cases.

Mind you, it was George Washington who once cautioned that if the freedom of speech is taken away, â€œdumb and silent we may be led like sheep to the slaughter.â€

Trump has taken actions that undermine the very essence of our country. He has endorsed a racist Senate candidate in Virginia who would like to return America to pre-Civil War conditions. He has justified the incarceration of children and their forcible separation from their parents by using the specter of national security to justify his subhuman actions. Trump is clearly unfamiliar with Benjamin Franklinâ€™s famous quote, â€œThey who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.â€

While Trumpâ€™s actions are grotesque, his words are even more cause for alarm. He routinely and flagrantly lies to the American people â€• 6.5 lies per day, or 3,251 falsities between taking office and June 1 of this year, according to The Washington Post.

Samuel Adams once said, â€œThe liberties of our country, the freedom of our civil constitution, are worth defending at all hazards: And it is our duty to defend them against all attacks.â€

The president of the United States is presiding over the systematic deconstruction of our way of life and governance. We have an obligation to fight back. Civility sounds nice and ideal, but thatâ€™s not the world we live in, and every day that goes by, the cult of Trump is marching us toward a point of no return.

Our country was born from the spirit of revolution. Right now, we are being subjected to the dangerous whims of a tyrannical thug. Lives are being destroyed. Liberties are being undermined.

3P4C70TRMSZR6BYER91OJESK88QGLH,5 trends to watch for in Tuesdayâ€™s Arizona and Florida primaries,"The battle for control of the Senate. Democrats' battle back to relevance in redistricting battles. Republicans' battle with themselves. Itâ€™s all playing out in Senate and governorâ€™s primaries Tuesday in two states, Arizona and Florida.

We broke down five big trends to watch for. Letâ€™s start with the Senate races in both states.

The Senate races

1. In a rough year for members of Congress running for higher office, will one of them actually win in Arizona? And how much does embracing President Trump have to do with it? Despite the fact that two of Trumpâ€™s main GOP antagonists in the Senate came from Arizona, Trumpism is king in Arizona Republican politics. Sen. John McCain died Saturday, and Sen. Jeff Flake is retiring at the end of this year rather than try to win a primary against opponents more willing to support Trump. But Arizona could be a state that underscores the perils for Republican candidates of embracing Trump too much to win their primaries.

The establishment candidate in a three-way primary for Flakeâ€™s seat has moved to the right. Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) has ditched her pro-immigration stances and even scrubbed a video from YouTube of her praising the Obama-era policy to protect â€œdreamersâ€ from deportation.

Republican operatives say she had no choice. Her opponents, state Sen. Kelli Ward and former sheriff Joe Arpaio (the one who was pardoned by Trump), are much more willing to be controversial flamethrowers in the mold of Trump. â€œPolitical correctness is like a cancer!â€ Ward tweeted Monday.

Ward and Arpaio are expected to split the uber-Trump vote, giving McSally a wide path to winning the nomination. But had just one of the Trumpian candidates been in the race, one Republican operative said, it could have been a different story for McSally.

If she prevails in the primary, McSally would have to pivot quickly to a much more moderate stance, since this is a state that went for Trump by just three points. And she would face a likely formidable opponent, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D). Democrats have no room for error, either: This is one of two-to-four Republican-held Senate races that Democrats probably need to win for them to take back the Senate.

2. In Floridaâ€™s Senate race, are Republicans finding some much-needed momentum? Honestly, the primaries for this Senate race are boring. The general election is what youâ€™ll want to watch. This is one of several Republican pickup opportunities, and despite a potentially bad year for Republicans nationwide, itâ€™s looking more competitive as the days go on. The only current statewide elected Democrat in Florida, Sen. Bill Nelson, is trying to hang on as tens of millions of dollars are being spent against him in support of wealthy, term-limited Gov. Rick Scott (R).

Scottâ€™s decision to run is a big reason this race is leaning toward Republicans. But Democrats warn against underestimating Nelson, who has outperformed every Democratic presidential nominee since Al Gore.

The governors' races

Republicans are defending two seats this November in Arizona and Florida, at least one of which could probably be categorized as a must-win for Democrats if they want to have a seat at the table in 2020 for redistricting one of the largest and most politically consequential states in the nation. But weâ€™ll get there in a minute.

3. Letâ€™s start with Arizonaâ€™s race for governor. In a blue wave, will Democrats knock out a sitting governor? The primaries arenâ€™t too exciting. Democrats say theyâ€™ll be happy with whoever wins Tuesday to challenge Gov. Doug Ducey (R) in November: Arizona State University professor David Garcia or state Sen. Steve Farley.

In an average election year, Ducey probably wouldnâ€™t be that vulnerable. In fact, in this election year, Arizona didnâ€™t make The Fixâ€™s list of top 10 most competitive governorâ€™s races. But Arizona is a state that is slowly trending bluer, and both sides acknowledge that in a blue wave, Democrats could do one of the hardest thing in politics: unseat a sitting governor. Donâ€™t believe me? Follow the money: The Republican Governors Association has reserved $9 million in TV airtime in Arizona â€” more than in any other state but Wisconsin (which did make The Fixâ€™s top 10) â€” to protect Ducey.

4. In Floridaâ€™s open governorâ€™s race, how much Trumpism is too much Trumpism? Unlike the Arizona governorâ€™s race, which is competitive with caveats, Floridaâ€™s open governorâ€™s race is what one Republican operative described as the truest toss-up race in the country. This is also the race that has the most interesting primaries, so letâ€™s start there.

On the Republican side, we're about to find out how much a presidential tweet endorsement matters.

Congressman Ron DeSantis, a top student at Yale and Harvard Law School, is running for Governor of the Great State of Florida. Ron is strong on Borders, tough on Crime &amp; big on Cutting Taxes - Loves our Military &amp; our Vets. He will be a Great Governor &amp; has my full Endorsement! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2018

Rep. Ron DeSantis wasnâ€™t supposed to win the crowded Republican primary for Floridaâ€™s open governorâ€™s seat. But Trump took a liking to the hard-line conservative, who is a regular on Fox News, and gave him the coveted presidential endorsement in a crowded field. Just like that, DeSantis is favored over the once-favorite, Agricultural Commissioner Adam Putnam.

But here the Republican winner could face the same conundrum as the nominee in the Arizona Senate race, perhaps exacerbated: Is the guy who literally filmed his toddler building a border wall too pro-Trump to win the governorâ€™s mansion in a swing state such as Florida?

Democrats hope so, because the next governor will have a say in drawing the congressional districts in one of the nationâ€™s largest states.

5. On the Democratic side, can progressives and the establishment play nice in November? Watchers of the Florida governorâ€™s race say they expect former congresswoman Gwen Graham to win Tuesdayâ€™s competitive Democratic primary. But operatives could also see a path of victory for Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who has the support of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and liberal billionaires George Soros and Tom Steyer, or former Miami Beach mayor Philip Levine. This has been a divisive primary for Democrats, so it could be an open question how well the party gets along to try to win this very competitive, extremely expensive seat in November. Democratic operatives in Washington say theyâ€™re confident the money will be together to seize one of the most consequential governorâ€™s mansions in the nation.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/5-trends-to-watch-for-in-tuesdays-arizona-and-florida-primaries/2018/08/28/dfdfbdd1-0c48-45ef-aa6f-285ca25dbaae_story.html,"['Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['1', '3', '2', '2', '3']"
3GL25Y6844CMYFBPGV277D74BPGXM4,Trump calls Brennan a 'very bad guy' after treason comments,"WASHINGTON - President Trump hit back at former CIA Director John Brennan, who had called the president's performance at yesterday's press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin ""nothing short of treasonous.""

""Well, I think Brennan is a very bad guy and if you look at it, a lot of things happened under his watch,"" Trump said in a pre-taped interview with Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson, which aired Tuesday night. ""I think he is a bad person.""

Brennan left his top post at the spy agency as Trump was coming into office, criticizing the incoming president on his way out. He's been a thorn in Trump's side ever since.

Carlson defended Trump's performance at the Helsinki summit in his opening monologue and blamed the president's bad reviews on neo-conservatives from the Bush years still in media and government who believe Russia should always be branded a threat.

Trump had his own set of people to blame, not only bashing Brennan, but bringing up FBI lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, along with former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe - who was fired in May, a day before his retirement - and ex-FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by Trump the year before.

""These are people that, in my opinion, are truly the bad people and they are being exposed for what they are and it's a shame that it has to happen, but it's really hurt our country,"" Trump said.

When discussing Russia, however, the president was hesitant to label it as an adversary.

""I don't even want to use the word 'adversary,'"" he said. ""We can all work together. We can do great. Everybody can do well and we can live in peace.""

In contrast in an interview with CBS Sunday, Trump raised eyebrows when he called the European Union, a longtime ally of the United States, a ""foe.""

Carlson's interview with Trump was pre-taped on Monday and since then, the president has walked back some of the comments he made while in Helsinki, including the impression that he left that he believed Putin's denial of election meddling over the assessment of his own intelligence community.

He has, however, continued to call the summit with the Russian leader a success.

""The meeting between President Putin and myself was a great success, except in the Fake News Media!"" Trump tweeted Tuesday night.

Trump also hasn't wavered on the subject of immigration.

On Friday, he told European leaders that immigration was ""changing the culture"" of their countries. ""I think it's a very negative thing for Europe. I think it's very negative. And I know it's politically not necessarily correct to say that, but I'll say it and I'll say it loud.""

Despite getting pushback for the comments he made, he repeated that sentiment when he sat down with Carlson.

The Fox News pundit asked him if he could ""think of a place that has been improved by mass immigration or movements of large numbers of refugees?""",https://nypost.com/2018/07/17/trump-calls-brennan-a-very-bad-guy-after-treason-comments/,"['Democratic', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Neutral', 'Republican']","['2', '4', '4', '2', '3']"

WASHINGTON â€” President Donald Trump still won't dismiss the idea of pardoning Paul Manafort after the former campaign chief was convicted by a jury earlier this week.

During a wide-ranging interview that aired Thursday morning on ""Fox &amp; Friends,"" Trump talked about whether he'd consider a pardon for Manafort, his relationship with former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, possible impeachment and his deep frustrations with the Justice Department.

Trump has flirted with the idea of pardoning Manafort for a while. During the weeks-long trial against Manafort, he was asked about the notion and wouldn't cast it aside.

""I have great respect for what heâ€™s done in terms of what heâ€™s going through,"" the president said.

Manafort's case was the first fought in court by special counsel Robert Mueller and his team, who are investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by the president. He was found guilty of eight counts by a 12-member jury.

Trump, during the interview, tried to dismiss some of the eight charges Manafort was convicted in, saying he was guilty of things everyone in Washington ""probably does.""

""I would say what he did, some of the charges they threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does,"" the president said.

Cohen 'flipping'

The president also attempted to diminish his relationship with Cohen, who pleaded guilty earlier this week to charges that implicated Trump in a hush scheme to pay off two women who alleged affairs with him during the 2016 election.

Trump said his longtime fixer was just ""one of many"" lawyers he had who helped him handle both big and small deals over about a decade. He characterized Cohen working for him only ""part-time.""

""I always found him to be a nice guy,"" Trump said. But that has changed, he said, because investigators found crimes tied to Cohen's taxi businesses, leading to his former lawyer ""flipping.""

Cohen had a choice, Trump said. He could receive a harsh sentence or ""make up stories"" and ""become a national hero.""

The president said the two campaign violations aren't even crimes, information he learned from watching TV news, he said. He added he did nothing wrong and the money paid to silence porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal were not illegal because they ""came from me"" and not his campaign.

""I know all about flipping,"" the president said. ""Everything is wonderful and then they get 10 years in jail and they flip on whoever the next highest one is.""

He added ""it's not fair"" and ""it almost ought to be outlawed"" because it encourages people to ""make up stories.""

What Trump left out of his interview was that Cohen didn't admit to the charges because he just wanted a lower sentence. Federal prosecutors laid out their case in court documents, outlining the timeline and others who were involved in the alleged scheme to violate campaign finance laws to affect the outcome of the election.

Federal prosecutors had been building a case for months and raided Cohen's hotel, home and office in April, finding a trove of information, including secretive recordinngs Cohen made of his conversations.

Attacking Justice

During the ""Fox &amp; Friends"" interview, Trump also pointed to Democrats and Hillary Clinton and said he was frustrated by the lack of action by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on investigating his opponents. When asked whether he would fire Sessions or his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, after the midterms, Trump didn't dismiss the idea.

""If you look at Hillary Clintonâ€™s person, you take a look at the people that work for Hillary Clinton, and look at the crimes that Clinton did with the emails and she deletes 33,000 emails after she gets a subpoena from Congress, and this Justice Department does nothing about it and all of the other crimes that theyâ€™ve done,"" he said.

The president went into detail about his frustrations with Sessions and his decision to recuse himself from heading the Mueller investigation, which in turn put Rosenstein in charge. Since Sessions recused himself in early 2017, the attorney general has often been criticized by Trump.

""[Sessions] took the job then he said 'I'm going to recuse myself,'"" Trump said. ""I said 'What kind of a man is this?'""

He said the only reason Sessions was given a job was because of his loyalty to the campaign. Trump dismissed Sessions' character as someone who ""hasn't taken charge"" of DOJ and added he wouldn't have hired him if he knew what he does now.

The sports betting landscape in America shifted forever on a Monday morning in May, when the U.S. Supreme Court released a game-changing ruling that put the nation on a path toward widespread legal sports betting.

Shortly after 10 a.m. ET, on May 14, the Supreme Court struck down the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which for 26 years had limited legal sports betting to primarily Las Vegas.

The interest in the decision was remarkable.

SCOTUS had already decided cases on terrorism, immigration and human rights violations in the term, but none of those hot-button issues generated near the public interest that the New Jersey sports betting case did. At SCOTUSBlog.com, the preeminent site covering the Supreme Court, the post announcing the sports betting decision drew nearly double the page views of any other post since last June.

As soon as the ruling was released, social media lit up with a mix of excitement and concern. Stock prices for domestic and international bookmaking companies surged, and a New Jersey racetrack announced that it was hustling to begin taking sports bets within weeks. Sports betting had made national news -- for something other than a controversy.



Even Golden State coach Steve Kerr took notice, joking before Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals that he was ""taking the Warriors +1.5."" 

""I read that whole story about gambling this morning,"" Kerr said with a smirk, ""so now I guess I'm allowed to announce my picks.""

To be clear: Americans were betting hundreds of billions of dollars on sports before the ruling and will continue doing so moving forward. Perhaps the most noticeable impact the Supreme Court ruling has had is that America now may be a little more comfortable talking about sports betting.

It's been a long process to get to this point.

Stiff opposition from the influential sports leagues, ties to the mob and decades of scandals tattooed a stigma on sports betting that other forms of gambling never had to overcome. On top of religious objections and concerns of addiction, sports betting was -- and continues to be -- viewed as a threat to the integrity of American sports.

There has been sudden sea change, though: In just the past five years, society's -- and the sports leagues' -- acceptance of sports betting has markedly increased. A myriad of factors brought us to this revolutionary point in American gambling history: Daily fantasy rose to prominence, the media embraced point-spread talk and the leagues, with the help of some new forward-thinking commissioners, softened their opposition.

It all culminated last week with a press conference that had the commissioner of the NBA sitting side-by-side with the CEO of one of the largest legal bookmakers in the U.S. to announce a partnership.

The times, they are a-changing, and whether or not America is ready, legal sports betting is now mainstream.

How did we get here?

  Fantasy football: More than ""just nerds""

Fantasy football didn't really start to annoy the NFL until the 1990s brought the internet into the game.

Organizing fantasy leagues, holding drafts and keeping score became more efficient, but player notes and injury updates still weren't readily available. This led to ambitious fantasy owners resorting to calling public relations offices for teams, asking for any details about injuries and player statuses.

""The leagues just hated us,"" said Greg Ambrosius, a longtime fantasy sports advocate and former chairman and president of the Fantasy Sports Trade Association. ""We were just nerds. Forget the fact that we were fans, they considered us a niche audience of stat geeks.""

Despite the NFL's reticence, media coverage of fantasy sports increased in the 1990s. In 1995, Ambrosius joined Starwave, ESPN.com's predecessor, as the site's first fantasy sports writer. CBS' SportsLine.com and Yahoo Sports also revved up fantasy coverage. The NFL remained hesitant. Network partners were discouraged from discussing fantasy during broadcasts, until an enterprising executive arrived at the NFL.

""Internet fantasy was only a few years old,"" recalled Chris Russo, who was hired in 1999 as NFL senior vice president and put in charge of new media, including the league's website, NFL.com. ""I think there was not a huge understanding of what it was, and maybe there were concerns about whether it would be right for the fans or could it be construed as gambling. There were a lot of questions.""

Russo, a casual fantasy player, set out to answer those questions and initiated a study on fantasy sports. He found fantasy players watched more games than average fans. Not surprisingly, this resonated with the league.

""It was like a lightbulb went on,"" remembered Peter Schoenke, a fantasy pioneer and president and co-founder of RotoWire.com. ""The NFL completely switched gears from distancing itself from fantasy to embracing it.""

NFL players started appearing in commercials for the league's fantasy game. The NFLPA began sponsoring fantasy conferences. Suddenly, the fantasy nerds and stat geeks were identified as diehard fans, leading NFL.com to launch its first fantasy game.



Roughly 10 years later, daily fantasy sports -- led by DraftKings and FanDuel --Â&nbsp; came along and disrupted the status quo. To many, DFS looked a lot more like sports betting than traditional season-long fantasy games among buddies. The NFL noticed the difference as well.

""Season-long fantasy ... it's for fun,"" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said during a 2015 fan forum in Minneapolis, adding that ""Daily fantasy's taken a little different approach.""

While the NFL expressed concerns, it didn't restrict owners and teams from getting a piece of the pie. Jerry Jones and Robert Kraft -- the prominent owners of the Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots, respectively -- invested in DraftKings. All but a few teams did marketing agreements with DFS companies, and high-profile players began promoting the games on social media.

The NBA and Major League Baseball, at the league level, also took equity positions in FanDuel and DraftKings, respectively, giving the growing startups a boost of legitimacy. But trouble was around the corner.

In the lead-up to the 2015 football season, DraftKings and FanDuel bombarded airwaves with advertising. At the peak of the marketing blitz -- a three-week stretch from August to September 2015 -- an ad for either DraftKings of FanDuel ran on national TV every 90 seconds. Politicians began to squawk about the rampant advertising, and then all hell broke loose.

In October, a DraftKings employee, who had just won $350,000 playing on FanDuel, erroneously published data perceived to be advantageous before the week's games had ended. Players were concerned that he had access to information that was not public and used it to set his lineups. Accusations of insider trading and cheating followed. An independent investigation later cleared the employee of any wrong-doing, but a torch had been lit. Federal and state inquiries were launched, and dozens of lawsuits were filed, including some that are still active today.

DFS survived it all, but industry growth subsided, and the major players are now shifting gears and becoming sports betting operators. FanDuel was recently purchased by European bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair and is running the sportsbook at the Meadowlands Racetrack in New Jersey. DraftKings also is aggressively moving into the sports betting space and last week became the first company to launch a mobile sportsbook in New Jersey.

""In a strange way,"" said Russo, now managing director of global investment bank Houlihan Lokey, ""all of the controversy around daily fantasy -- Is it a game of skill? Is it gambling? -- may have been the bridge to sports gambling.""

Regardless of the missteps and shakier legal footing of DFS, one thing is clear: sports fans playing fantasy sports (daily or season-long) are more engaged fans. And DFS is a perfect fit for a younger generation, which wants quick payouts available from their phone.

""The media also has had big impact,"" Russo added, ""in part because there was such intense coverage of the fantasy debate. And that has led to the next question, which is if daily fantasy is OK, why not sports betting? Is that really that much of a jump?""  Sports media

Think you've heard all Lee Corso's best catchphrases? Not so fast, my friend.

Behind the scenes, during early production meetings for ""College GameDay,"" the charismatic coach also had a go-to line that may be his most poignant: ""All people care about is who is going to win and by how many.""

""That's it,"" said vice president of ESPN college sports and longtime GameDay producer Lee Fitting of Corso's straightforward take on the show's audience. ""And if you're ignorant to that fact, you're missing the boat completely.""

Right now, the mainstream media is all aboard the sports-betting boat, but it's been a long and bumpy voyage dating back to the 70s.



Hall of fame sportscaster Brent Musburger points back to 1976, when then-NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle decided to add bookmaker Jimmy ""The Greek"" Snyder on CBS's iconic Sunday morning preview show, ""The NFL Today.""

""The Greek really brought it more mainstream,"" recalled Musburger, now living in Las Vegas, where he broadcasts from a studio in the middle of a casino for the Vegas Stats &amp; Information Network (VSiN).

Musburger and the Greek were asked not to mention the exact point spread during the show, but they worked around it, setting the stage for decades of veiled gambling references during game broadcasts.

The final drive of Super Bowl XXIX between the San Francisco 49ers and San Diego Chargers is a prime example. Then-ABC broadcaster Al Michaels was on the call. The 49ers, who were 18.5-point favorites, had the game wrapped up, leading 49-26 late in the fourth quarter. Starting inside San Diego's own 10-yard line, quarterback Stan Humphries drove the Chargers into San Francisco territory, connecting with Tony Martin for a first down to the 49ers' 43-yard line with around 40 seconds left.

""That will make a few people around this great land of ours move to the forward portion of the couch,"" Michaels quipped. ""You better believe it.""

A touchdown would be meaningless to the outcome, but would have covered the spread.

In the final seconds, Humphries lofted a pass toward the corner of the end zone.



""Hearts beating all over the land ..."" said Michaels, slyly noting nervous bettors sweating the final plays. ""Incomplete.""

""There were a couple of us, Al Michaels and myself, who were never really shy about it,"" Musburger said of his knack of referencing the betting impact late in games. ""I think we realized that you can hold an audience with it.""

The wink-and-nod gambling references chipped away at America's fear of sports betting, but it was a slow process.

Musburger said potential blowback from the sports leagues kept mainstream media, including ESPN, from embracing sports betting sooner. ESPN didn't start running NFL point spreads on the SportsCenter Bottom Line until 2000, at first restricting them to a 12-hour overnight window from late Saturday until about 15 minutes before ""NFL Countdown"" started Sunday morning.

The reins began to loosen later in the decade. In 2008, ESPN.com began a regular gambling column and podcast ""Behind the Bets,"" and, in 2014, launched ""Chalk,"" the site's vertical dedicated to gambling. Around the same time, leading into the 2014 college football season, Fitting told the GameDay cast that they were going to ""stick our neck out there a little bit"" and talk more openly about point spreads, odds and sports betting overall, something long frowned upon by the NCAA.

""Too often, you run into people and they're scared, like gambling is a bad word,"" said Fitting. ""You can't be scared of it. Our motto has been to be fearless, but not reckless when talking gambling.""

Lines and over/under totals for games started being included in more graphics, not to be referenced with every matchup, but more so as just an added piece of content. Chris Fallica, a seasoned handicapper affectionately known as ""Bear,"" was infused more on camera, albeit to the side of the show's main set, where gambling probably belongs in the big picture of college sports -- it's a part of the story, but not the main show.

""I do think that everyone will need to find the right way of highlighting [betting], while not letting it overtake the pureness and the fun of the game,"" Russo told ESPN. ""I don't think anyone has any answers on that yet.

""I think the leagues will have to balance that with the broadcasters,"" he added. ""It's great to have engagement, but if you lose a bunch of money then you're not so engaged anymore.""



It's a line that the traditional mainstream media outlets that own rights must negotiate moving forward. The CBS, Fox, NBC and ESPNs of the world need to decide how to serve their pure sports fan audiences, while also engaging a growing demographic of viewers who are more interested in ""who is going to win and by how much"" -- and at the same time avoid upsetting their sports league partners.

Some newer outlets, like Musburger's VSiN, and The Chernin Group's Action Network are flipping the model on its head. They've chosen to focus on the sports bettor more than the sports fan. And they were going to launch regardless of SCOTUS' ruling -- though it certainly didn't hurt.

The Action Network combines established fantasy and sports betting analytic sites with an app tailored for bettors and launched last fall, under the direction of former ESPN executive Chad Millman.

""[We're] really catering to both the fantasy and betting markets that already exist in the U.S.,"" Mike Kerns, president of digital for The Chernin Group, said in a phone interview just days before the Supreme Court ruling. ""We've studied it: The United States already has the largest per capita sports betting society in the world, even though it's illegal everywhere outside of Las Vegas.""

VSiN operates out of a broadcast studio that sits in middle of a Las Vegas casino, adjacent to the 24-hour South Point sportsbook. The company is expanding outside of Nevada, too, and is now contributing regular print content to the New York Post.

""Even if the Supreme Court ruled against New Jersey,"" added Brian Musburger, Brent's nephew and co-founder and chairman of VSiN, ""it [wouldn't] stop sports betting in the United States. People are finding a way to put a little money on sports events, and that's not going to change.""

A rise in recent years of gambling-centric stories hasn't hurt, ranging from Leicester City winning the 2015-16 Premier League title at 5,000-1 odds to Floyd Mayweather attempting to bet on his fight against Conor McGregor, to the Philadelphia Eagles wearing dog masks throughout their underdog run to the Super Bowl LII title.

""I think that everyone became aware of the nuanced ways that you could talk about sports betting that connected the storytelling to the conversation in ways that were more than a wink and a nod,"" Millman said. ""It connected it to the analytics, the stats and the alternative ways to examine a game, which happened to be the ways that people in Las Vegas, professional sports bettors have been doing it for a long time.""  Sports leagues change their tune on betting It was an awkward moment inside the Supreme Court, towards the end of oral arguments in the New Jersey sports betting case. Chief Justice John Roberts seemed dumbfounded by U.S. Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, who was arguing on the side of the NCAA and major professional sports leagues.

""Well, is that serious?"" Roberts asked Wall. ""You have no problem if there's no prohibition at all and anybody can engage in any kind of gambling they want, a 12-year-old can come into the casino and -- you're not serious about that.""

Wall paused before responding: ""I -- I'm very serious about it, Mr. Chief Justice.""

The entire courtroom seemed to squirm in their seats, and there were a few hushed, but audible gasps, as if underdog New Jersey had just scored the decisive blow.

Four months later, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey, 6-3, handing the NCAA and major professional sports leagues a jarring defeat on an issue that for decades they had decried as their mortal enemy -- sports betting.

In 2012 deposition testimony, Goodell said gambling was the No. 1 threat to the integrity of the game. Then-MLB commissioner Bud Selig said sports betting was ""evil,"" and the NHL's Gary Bettman and NCAA president Mark Emmert echoed those sentiments in an effort to stop New Jersey. At that point, the leagues' opposition to legalizing sports betting appeared united and unwavering, but, behind the scenes, the NBA was plotting change.

In 2006, then-NBA deputy commission Adam Silver began to question if forcing the bulk of the billions of dollars wagered on sports in the U.S. into a black market was the most pragmatic approach. He witnessed in person how jurisdictions in Europe and Asia dealt with sports betting and started to listen to pitches from international gaming companies.



Thoughts of pivoting the NBA's position were halted in 2007 when the Tim Donaghy scandal was revealed. For gambling, this was as ugly as it gets: a referee convicted of providing information to gamblers and admitting to betting on basketball himself, including games he officiated. The NBA never saw it coming.

The safeguards the league had in place didn't detect the bets by Donaghy or his co-conspirators, because evidence showed that they were made mostly with local and offshore bookmakers. Gaining more transparent access to the largest betting markets became a priority for Silver. The best way to accomplish that, he thought, was to bring sports betting out into the open.

""[I] believe that sports betting should be brought out of the underground and into the sunlight where it can be appropriately monitored and regulated,"" Silver wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times that was posted online mid-evening Nov. 13, 2014 and ran the following day in the print edition under the headline, ""Legalize Sports Betting.""

It was a stunning icebreaker on a taboo topic for the sports leagues. Months later, new Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred said publicly ""fresh consideration"" should be given to legalizing betting. And within the next two years, the NHL and NFL allowed franchises to be placed in Las Vegas, America's sports betting capital. At least to a degree, the leagues' doomsday outlook at sports betting legalization began to fade.

""I do think Adam Silver's New York Times op-ed was a watershed moment for sports betting,"" said Andrew Brandt, former vice president of the Green Bay Packers. ""There have been mixed messages for some time, with leagues espousing integrity yet realizing the reality of the fan-engagement possibilities of sports betting. But here was the commissioner of the second-most popular sports league taking it upon himself to support bringing gambling out into the open. That gave credibility to the stance and opened the door for investment into DFS companies, less taboo in talking about it, and eventual -- though gradual -- similar sentiments from other commissioners."" 

Just as there will always be human competition, there also will be people to bet on it -- legal or not. In fact, gambling is one of mankind's oldest activities. Evidence indicates our ancestors, shortly after developing opposable thumbs, made dice out of animal bones to play games. Babylonian soldiers held chariot races, and by the 8th century B.C., laws addressing gambling were in place in Ancient Rome.

Today, the American Gaming Association estimates $150 billion is wagered on sports annually in the U.S., with only a tiny percentage taking place in Nevada's regulated market. Silver has cited estimates as high as $400 billion in annual sports wagers, or nearly double Apple's annual revenue.

No one really knows how much we're betting, but one thing is clear about America's sports betting affinity -- it's never going to stop and now it has a legal stamp of approval.

 

""Americans have never been of one mind about gambling,"" Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito wrote in the first sentence of his opinion for the New Jersey case, ""and attitudes have swung back and forth.""

As Alito noted, how far society has evolved on sports betting remains up for debate. A poll conducted in May by the National Research Group of more than 1,000 Americans found 60 percent now approve of sports gambling, a dramatic shift compared to results of similar polls conducted 30 years ago when 56 percent disapproved. However, passionate opposition, with concerns over potential spikes in addiction, game corruption and predatory gambling practices, continue to resist.

Still, states are moving forward quickly. Since the May 14 decision, Delaware, New Jersey and Mississippi have begun taking sports bets, and West Virginia is aiming to be up and running by the start of the NFL season. New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island also have sports betting laws in place, and 14 additional states have introduced legislation to address the issue.

It's happening fast, whether America accepts it or not.

3OWZNK3RYM74A7D118808XU2BPR2U9,"Pro-Life, Pro-Choice Groups Pouring Resources Into Midterm Elections","According to polls this summer, abortion was far from many Americans' top priority for the midterms, but two of the largest advocacy groups surrounding that issue upped their ground game compared to previous elections.

That's probably because while President Donald Trump's administration has focused on tax cuts and immigration, it also pursued legislation and executive actions that both sides of the abortion debate have marked as significant developments on the issue.

Judge Brett Kavanaugh's likely confirmation will also put the Supreme Court in the hands of a conservative majority and will make it more likely that pro-life legislation -- both at the state and federal level -- will face less opposition if it reaches the top of the judicial branch.

Planned Parenthood Votes, the group's political action committee, said its ground game for the upcoming election cycle was its largest yet for midterms.

""We have a clear message for politicians who are undermining our freedoms and making it harder to get health care: We're voting you out in 2018,"" Planned Parenthood Votes Executive Director Deirdre Schifeling said in a press release.

Although the organization is likely best known for abortion and contraception, the group has also been at the forefront of denouncing Trump, whom many left-leaning individuals saw as a disaster for women's rights.

Last week, the group announced its political and advocacy arms would implement a $20 million ground game initiative in multiple states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Hampshire, Florida, Nevada, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.

""We have an army of volunteers,"" Kelley Robinson, the group's national organizing director, reportedly said. With a goal of reaching 4.5 million voters, the group already held more than 30 kickoff meetings with more than 400 volunteers.

In some of those states, however, the group will likely have to counter the pro-life group Susan B. Anthony List's massive army of canvassers.

The group has already knocked on 1.5 million doors in Indiana, Florida, Missouri, Ohio, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Montana. It also got a head start, funneling resources into the 2017-2018 election cycle for the past 19 months.

SBA List told IJR that it's hoping to knock on 2 million doors and expand its ranks to 1,000 canvassers by Election Day. Using previous election data, the group is targeting persuadable voters and pro-lifers who typically only vote in presidential election years.

The group has been telling voters about legislators' stances on taxpayer funding for abortion and/or late-term abortion -- a strategy it said persuaded the vast majority (82 percent) of target voters to be less likely to vote for their Democratic incumbent.

Planned Parenthood has maintained that public opinion is on its side, pointing to polls showing majorities favoring abortion access and supporting funding for the organization.

Earlier this year, Marist and the Knights of Columbus released polling results showing that while the vast majority of Americans supported abortion access under certain circumstances, 76 percent favored significant restrictions on abortion.

The poll, released in January, came out around the same time that Senate Democrats blocked a federal ban on abortions after 20 weeks -- a move that provoked Trump's ire and that will likely be part of both Planned Parenthood's and SBA List's messaging in the lead-up to midterms.

While it's unclear what Congress will pursue next year, pro-life advocates have expressed dismay that Republicans haven't leveraged their supermajority to defund Planned Parenthood. The group receives hundreds of millions in taxpayer funds but maintains that the money doesn't go toward abortion.

Trump tried to make it more difficult for abortion providers like Planned Parenthood to keep federal funds when his Health and Human Services Department proposed a rule effectively requiring organizations to choose between performing abortions and receiving Title X grants.",https://ijr.com/2018/09/1123110-pro-anti-abortion-groups-midterm/,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['1', '1', '1', '4', '3']"

Treasurer Scott Morrison, architect of the countryâ€™s famously tough migration and border policies, claimed the countryâ€™s top position on Friday after a party room ballot sealed the fate of Malcolm Turnbull.

Mr. Morrison, 50, won a closed door leadership vote 45-40 to end Mr. Turnbullâ€™s troubled time at the nationâ€™s helm. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, another ally of the former prime minister, was also in the running but was eliminated in the opening voting round.

Mr. Turnbull is the fourth Australian PM in 10 years to be ousted by party colleagues. He had been under pressure from poor polling and what he described as an â€œinsurgencyâ€ by fellow conservative coalition MPs.

ï»¿

â€œIt has been such a privilege to be the leader of this great nation. I love Australia. I love Australians,â€ Mr. Turnbull said at his final press conference.

Speaking to reporters after the vote on Friday, Mr. Morrison said he wants to â€œbring our party back together which has been bruised and battered this weekâ€ and bring the country together.

He also said dealing with a severe drought, which has hit parts of eastern Australia, would be â€œour most urgent and pressing need right nowâ€.

Although he first entered Parliament in 2007, Mr. Morrison first rose to the publicâ€™s attention as immigration minister and his introduction of tough asylum seeker policies alongside offshore detention centres for processing illegal arrivals.

Mr. Morrison is the son of a policeman and an active member of a Sydney Pentecostal evangelical church.

3TLFH2L6YA6PAUYC13IQ3180SBK2TI,"Alan Diaz, photographer behind Elian Gonzalez image, dies at 71","Retired Associated Press photojournalist Alan Diaz , whose photo of a terrified 6-year-old Cuban boy named Elian Gonzalez earned him the Pulitzer Prize, has died. He was 71.

Diaz's daughter, Aillette Rodriguez-Diaz, confirmed that he died Tuesday. The cause of death wasn't immediately known.

""He was the king of the family,"" Rodriguez-Diaz said. ""He cared about all of his friends and colleagues. His life was photography and my mother.""

Diaz's wife, Martha, died nearly two years ago.

Diaz's iconic image shows an armed U.S. immigration agent confronting the boy in the Little Havana home where he lived with relatives after being found floating off the Florida coast.

""Alan Diaz captured, in his iconic photographs, some of the most important moments of our generation - the bitter, violent struggle over the fate of a small Cuban boy named Elian Gonzalez, the magnified eye of a Florida election official trying to make sense of hanging chads and disputed ballots in the 2000 presidential election,"" AP executive editor Sally Buzbee said.

""He was gravelly-voiced and kindhearted, generous with his expertise. And like all great photographers, he was patient. He was able to wait for the moment.""

Diaz reminisced about getting the award-winning photo when he retired in December. He was freelancing for AP when a boater found a 5-year-old Cuban boy floating in an inner tube in the waters off Fort Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day 1999.

He would be the only photojournalist to capture the moment five months later when U.S. immigration agents ended a bitter international custody battle with a pre-dawn raid the night before Easter, pulling a terrified Elian Gonzalez from his uncle's Little Havana home so he could be returned to his father in Cuba.

Diaz said he was just in the right place at the right time.

He had spent months chatting with Gonzalez's relatives and neighbors over cafecito and cigarettes, earning their trust by respecting an order from the boy's uncle to not speak to the child.

When he heard a radio call that the raid had begun, Diaz jumped a fence and was ushered into the house by a friend of Gonzalez's relatives. Huddled with relatives in a bedroom, the terrified boy asked Diaz, ""What's happening? What's happening?"" Aiming his camera at the bedroom door, Diaz tried to soothe the child, saying, ""Nothing's happening, it's going to be all right.""

Moments later, armed federal agents wearing tactical gear burst inside to find the crying boy in the arms of the Cuban boater who had rescued him. Diaz later handed off his camera's memory card without checking the images â€” he just called AP's photo editor in Miami and said, ""I got the shot.""

After the image hit the wires and network television news, Diaz saw how both Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Cuban-American community leaders used it to argue that the other side was brutal and heartless.

""I have no opinion on it. I shot the moment. That's all,"" Diaz said last year. ""Good or bad, that's what happened that morning.""

The AP hired Diaz as a staff photographer two months after the raid, sending him to cover sporting events such as the Super Bowl, hurricanes, the aftermath of Sept. 11, elections and breaking news.

""Alan Diaz will be remembered for taking one of the most iconic photographs in Miami's history,"" AP Miami photo editor Marta Lavandier said. ""But what is less known about Alan is that he was a humble, dedicated, hard-working news photographer that loved covering every aspect of his community.""

After winning the Pulitzer Prize in 2001, he was awed by the celebration from his heroes in photojournalism.

""Joe Rosenthal wanted to meet me? Wow,"" Diaz said, still shaking his head at being honored by the AP photojournalist who produced the iconic image of U.S. Marines and a Navy sailor raising the American flag over Iwo Jima.

Diaz was born in New York to Cuban parents. He spent his adolescence in Cuba, where he studied photography with Alberto Korda, whose 1960 portrait of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara became one of the most reproduced images in history.

In 1978, he moved to Miami and began shooting in Little Havana for Cuban-American organizations and publications. One memorable assignment was a meeting of leaders of anti-Castro efforts and Frank Sturgis, one of the Watergate burglars, who had fought alongside Castro in Cuba before turning against him.",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/07/03/alan-diaz-photographer-behind-elian-gonzalez-image-dies-at-71.html,"['Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['4', '4', '1', '1', '1']"
3YLPJ8OXX9V6UPMJAR2BLJQ4PL44XZ,Hungary's Orban Farewells Israel with Visit to Jerusalem Holy Site,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Friday ended a brief, highly successful trip to Israel with a visit to a major Jewish shrine in Jerusalem.

Donning a dark hat in accordance with Jewish practice, Mr. Orban arrived at the Western Wall â€“ the holiest place at which Jews are allowed to pray â€“ accompanied by its rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz.

In keeping with tradition, Mr. Orban placed a note in a crack between the wallâ€™s massive stones that Jews believe were a supporting wall of the Biblical second temple.

His visit was symbolic because some of Judaismâ€™s holiest sites are located in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount and the Western Wall in Jerusalem; the Tomb of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs in Hebron; and Josephâ€™s Tomb in Nablus.

The trip has been hailed a success by both Hungary and Israel after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the Hungarian as a â€œtrue friend of Israelâ€ at a press conference to kick off the visit, as Breitbart London reported.

â€œ[Prime Minister OrbÃ¡nâ€™s] visit will promote the good bilateral relations as expressed, inter alia, by Hungaryâ€™s support of Israelâ€™s position in European and international fora and by emphasizing the importance of the continued struggle against anti-Semitism,â€ the ministry noted in an official statement.

Mr. Netanyahu also extended his praise to all the Visegrad group, which includes Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, and whose strong stances on immigration have been a thorn in Brusselsâ€™ side.

The Hungarian leader hosted Mr. Netanyahu in Budapest last year, and was praised by his Israeli guest for being â€œat the forefront of the states that are opposed toâ€¦ anti-Jewish policyâ€, and expressed â€œthe appreciation of my government and many people in Israel for thisâ€.

Budapest believes the Israel visit is â€œan important step in dispelling the charges of anti-Semitism in Hungary and the OrbÃ¡n Government.â€

The trip by Mr. Netanyahu was the first to Budapest by an Israeli prime minister since the fall of Communism in 1989.

3UZUVSO3P8DDSFK8LQCFJOMXVSDMEA,Trumpâ€™s racist views have not gone unnoticed,"President Trump, more than any modern president, freely expresses his racist views â€” whether it is calling Mexican immigrants rapists, asserting that immigrants â€œinfestâ€ America, saying neo-Nazis include some â€œvery fine people,â€ preferring Norwegian immigrants to those from â€œshitholeâ€ countries or associating immigrants with crime in public and in private. (In May The Post reported on an episode in April 2017: â€œTrump reminded them the crowds loved his rhetoric on immigrants along the campaign trail. Acting as if he were at a rally, he recited a few made-up Hispanic names and described potential crimes they could have committed, such as rape or murder. Then, he said, the crowds would roar when the criminals were thrown out of the country â€” as they did when he highlighted crimes by illegal immigrants at his rallies. . . .â€) Add in his ongoing feud with African American football players who kneel for the national anthem to protest police brutality (â€œGet that son of a bitch off the field right nowâ€œ) and his attack on African American Rep. Maxine Watersâ€™s (D-Calif.) intelligence, and you see a president who is either catering to racists or himself harbors racist views.

Voters have noticed. The Quinnipiac poll released this week shows a plurality (49 percent) think he is a racist while 47 percent do not. Among the 47 percent are 86 percent of Republicans, roughly the same percentage that support him. (They simply will not believe the president they voted for is a racist.) More young voters (18-34 years) think he is a racist (56 percent) than do older voters. Perhaps there is something to the polling on millennials that says they are more tolerant and inclusive than older Americans (and themselves are more diverse). Nevertheless, by a small margin (50 percent to 44 percent) voters are willing to believe Trumpâ€™s sincere beliefs about controlling the border, not racism, are the main motivator for his immigration policies.

Even more interesting, a large majority (55 percent to 39 percent) think Trump has emboldened other people to voice racist views. Even 22 percent of Republicans acknowledge that. Women, those with college degrees, younger voters and African Americans say Trump has emboldened racists to speak out in greater numbers than voters without college degrees, older voters and whites. In short, even if Americans do not admit Trump is a racist, they are willing to concede heâ€™s popularized racist language. When it comes to handling race relations or uniting the country, a substantial majority (58 percent disapprove, 36 percent approve for both) disapprove of his performance.

Voters are also far less cavalier about the fate of Hispanic children than Trump is. â€œSeparating children from their parents was a violation of human rights, American voters say 60-36 percent,â€ the pollsters report. â€œThe Trump Administration has a responsibility to unite these children with their parents, voters say 83 â€“ 12 percent. Undocumented immigrants are not more likely than American citizens to commit crimes, American voters say 69 â€“ 25 percent.â€

There are a few takeaways from this data.

First, in case you thought Trump was â€œgetting awayâ€ with his racism, heâ€™s not. In the most blunt phrasing possible virtually half of Americans call him a â€œracist,â€ close to the worst thing you can call someone in public life. Even more apparent to voters is his influence on encouraging racism among others and dividing the country. If Democrats want to get traction among voters not already in their corner theyâ€™d be much smarter to attack Trump for what he is doing to the country (e.g. dividing, emboldening racists) than calling Trump and his supporters racists.

Second, Americans are as united as they ever are on the obligation to reunite families. Any Democrat or anti-Trump Republican should regularly raise Trumpâ€™s failure to do so. Trumpâ€™s Republican Party has not only forfeited any claim to be the party of â€œfamily values,â€ but has also disgraced America in the eyes of the world. This is not what most Americans expect or want of their country. (Remarkably, 60 percent are willing to call Trumpâ€™s child separation policy a human rights violation.) Critics of Trumpâ€™s inhumane policy of child separation should not be assuaged with the shift to indefinite incarceration for whole families. Jailing children under any circumstances in this context is unacceptable; forcing parents to make a choice between giving up their kids or giving up their legitimate asylum claims is grotesque.

Third, Americans are more resistant to racism than one might imagine. They donâ€™t think immigrants commit more crimes, donâ€™t like his immigration policies (58 percent to 39 percent) and by a large plurality want to make it easier to immigrate to America (49 percent to 32 percent). After two years of hearing Trump smear and dehumanize immigrants, they arenâ€™t buying his line. Those who favor robust legal immigration and a humane, sensible policy toward illegal immigrants (including â€˜dreamersâ€™) donâ€™t need to be defensive. They should make the case â€” with plenty of facts on their side â€” that immigrants have always made America great. Itâ€™s Trump who is making us small.

31S7M7DAGH8VBGKKB90VIX79Y2YLTV,Why France's World Cup Win Raises Questions Around French Identity,"These Parisian banlieues are home to many African and Caribbean immigrants and their French-born or -raised children, including many of the soccer superstars celebrated for bringing a World Cup victory to France for the second time in the country's history last weekend. Kylian MbappÃ©, who won the tournament's Best Young Player Award, grew up with a Cameroonian father and Algerian Mother in Bondy; Paul Pogba, whose parents are Guinean, has spoken openly about his family's experience in Roissy-en-Brie; Blaise Matuidi was raised in Fontenay-sous-Bois, a community in the city's eastern suburbs, with Angolan and Congolese parents. The names go on: N'Golo KantÃ©, Presnel Kimpembe, Benjamin Mendy, and Steven Nzonzi all grew up and were discovered in similarly constructed neighborhoods centered around immigrant communities that had access to a wide network of soccer clubs.

Now, in the limelight of their success, and with the diaspora communities in France and worldwide openly celebrating the dualities of their peripheral identities, the French establishment is pushing back, insisting that the players are purely ""French"" and that to bring up their African heritage is a racist sentiment. All this resulted in the French ambassador to the United States sending a stern letter to Daily Show host Trevor Noah this week for jokingly remarking that ""Africa won the World Cup.""

Identity in France is a fraught conversation. As a tool of supremacy, the country has leveraged the bestowment of ""French identity"" at will, using citizenship as a reward for shedding the vestiges of the colonized nations that African migrants had previously called home. It is a complex narrative that comes with reconciling some painful truths of imperialism and colonization. Moreover, the liberal overcorrection of the ahistorical ""one France"" serves as a thin barrier to confronting the reality of centuries of black French citizens being categorically discriminated against, at all levels of society -- from being obstructed in acquiring suitable housing, employment, and education for generations to being racially profiled for identity and nationality checks. In a 2016 report from the French National Institute for Demographic Studies, or INED, a survey of more than 22,000 case studies of second-generation French citizens of African descent identified that second-generation African immigrants continue to be ""highly disadvantaged"" in the labor and education market.

This is all overridden, of course, if they showcase exemplary value on a stage such as this year's World Cup -- or in outlier cases like the ""Spiderman"" story from earlier this year, in which a young Malian migrant man literally scaled the front of a building, climbing four floors to save a toddler who was dangling from a balcony. While it is certainly true that the far right in France has used the label of ""African"" to ostracize black citizens and their immigrant and/or refugee families, with an emphasis on putting ""native French first,"" their more cosmopolitan counterparts approach the matter as a meritorious allocation that comes with an asterisk: When you are not succeeding at the highest level then you are swiftly shellacked for it and reminded of how French you are not. This was the experience of the 2010 French World Cup team during their resounding collapse in South Africa when France exited the tournament at the group stages. If you are not fortunate enough to be a transcendent talent in sport, create a national sensation of impressive feat, or establish acclaim in a crossover entertainment market like artists such as Imany, then the acceptance of your ""Frenchness"" as an average citizen comes with an implicit social contract. It's shown in the form of inquiry as to where your family is ""originally"" from -- shedding all veneer of a ""common French heritage"" as merely a matter of niceties and wishful thinking.

For these reasons, insisting on a narrative of colorblind citizenship flies in the face of the history of French socialization. It is a systematic demand that French culture comes complicit with assimilation, as if there is a magical threshold of assimilation possible to supersede ingrained stratifications within society. Dismissing their African heritage makes French Africans no more likely to get an apartment on the other side of the PÃ©riphÃ©rique, or obtain better jobs. Nor will it change the insults levied by the National Rally (formerly known as the National Front) led by Marine Le Pen. Separating the most successful soccer players in the world from any narrative that ties them to immigration is impractical to their reality as well; their lives are impacted by these stories through family and friends. The communities they grew up in were filled by people who were overwhelmingly reminded of their dual realities daily; their heritage and their citizenship, an inescapable truth. Their parents may have been naturalized, but as the INED report indicated, more than half of those polled think that European-descended French citizens do not regard them as French -- and that is a disconnect that persists in their daily existence in the margins of urban enclaves.",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/shamiraibrahim/france-world-cup-win-africa-won,"['Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['1', '2', '1', '1', '1']"
38F60IALAHZIEKVYMGECKDFLVQRT06,'Suffering' ends with Honduran baby back in parents' arms,"next

prev

Baby Johan spent his first day home chasing his family's kitten, bouncing to music and playing like any 15-month-old boy.

But his mom said Saturday he also seemed lost in his own home â€” not recognizing his favorite aunt and only able to sleep with the lights on after spending five months in U.S. custody forcibly separated from his parents.

""We have to give him time, be patient,"" his mother, Adalicia Montecinos said with a tired smile after her first night back with her son, who only slept for a few hours.

He also seemed to be speaking words that his mom figured were likely in English.

For months, the couple watched their only son grow up in videos while he was kept at a U.S. government-contracted shelter in Phoenix. That's where he took his first steps and spoke his first words.

Johan, who grabbed the world's attention when he appeared in a U.S. courtroom in diapers, at first also didn't recognize his mom and dad after he was flown to San Pedro Sula on Friday.

Adalicia broke down Friday in tears as she talked about how her son had become a poster child for outrage over the Trump administration's policy of separating immigrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.

""He suffered everything that we have been suffering,"" she said.

His father soon won him over by playing ball. Within an hour, the tiny boy in an orange tank top, blue shorts but no shoes laughed as both parents kissed him outside a center where they finished final legal paperwork before heading home.

And so ended the extraordinary journey of a baby whose short life has ranged from Honduran poverty to a desperate dash across the U.S. border to the front pages of the world's newspapers.

Captured by Border Patrol agents almost instantly upon arrival, Johan's father was deported â€” and the 10-month-old was kept at the Arizona shelter. Over the next five months, he spoke and walked for the first time and had his first birthday; his parents, hundreds of miles away, would miss it all.

""The nightmare is over,"" Adalicia said Saturday as she washed clothes in an outdoor sink outside their cement home in the steamy mountains in central Honduras.

But the family faces new challenges as their son readjusts and she fears the effects of their separation will be lasting.

Johan shook his head ""no"" over and over when his aunt who lives with the family picked him up. He has been fussier and Adalicia wondered if it was because of tiredness from his long journey or something more serious.

Only time will tell, said Clara Long, a researcher with Human Rights Watch. At least a dozen parents were deported back to their homelands without their children.

""I think we don't know the future impact on these kids who were separated from their parents, but it could be life-long,"" she said.

In early July, Johan went before an immigration judge. An Associated Press account of that court appearance â€” of the judge's befuddlement over how to deal with this tiny detainee in diapers, sucking on a bottle â€” set off an international furor.

""I never thought they could be so cruel,"" said his father, Rolando Antonio Bueso Castillo, 37.

Rolando said he thought his plan was a beautiful one. He would escape his hard life in the tiny town of Libertad â€” Freedom, in Spanish. His children would not grow up in the same poverty that he had endured â€” he had dropped out of the fourth grade to sell burritos to help his single mom support him and his four siblings.

His younger brother left the coffee-growing mountains of central Honduras for the United States seven years ago and thrived in Maryland with his wife and children. His sister followed, and also did well. Their eldest brother was killed in a drive-by shooting in San Pedro Sula, one of Latin America's most dangerous cities.

Rolando earned $10 a day driving a bus; his brother in America sent back hundreds of dollars to help out.

An easy-going and hard-working man, Rolando was well aware of the dangers of crossing Mexico. Scores of Central Americans have fallen to their deaths jumping on trains or been shaken down by Mexican police, murdered, kidnapped, robbed or raped on their way to the United States.

He paid a smuggler $6,000, money his brother sent to him. Everything was supposed to be included â€” hotel stays, three meals daily and transport in an SUV with two other mothers and three children to the U.S. border. He packed five onesies, three jackets, a blue-and-white baby blanket, lotion, cream, 50 diapers, two bottles and cans of formula.

His wife, in her first trimester of pregnancy, would stay behind, working at her market stand selling Nike baseball hats, ""California Dreaming"" T-shirts and jewelry. In Maryland, their family would help mind Johan while Rolando worked. Adalicia would join them in a few months.

The father and son made it as far as Tampico, Mexico, 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the Texas border, when their beautiful plan started to unravel.

The smuggler drove them into a warehouse in the port city and told them to board a tractor trailer filled with scores of other parents and children from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Peru.

Rolando and his son would spend three days locked in the trailer, before arriving to the Mexican border city of Reynosa, where they boarded a makeshift raft and floated across the Rio Grande to Texas.

He thought the worst was over, but his troubles were only beginning.

Within minutes a Border Patrol agent stopped them and they were taken to a detention center.

On the fifth day, immigration officers told Rolando they needed to take him to an office for questioning. One agent removed Johan from his arms. As they walked away, Johan turned, reaching for his dad.

It would be the last time they would see each other for five months.

The agents told Rolando he was going to be separated from the boy and deported to Honduras because this was the fourth time he had attempted to enter the United States. Each time, he was caught almost immediately.

Rolando spent 22 days locked up in various detention centers along the Texas border. He knew nothing of his son.

His wife would wake up reaching for her baby and remember again what had happened. She watched videos of Johan over and over of him kicking and wiggling, laughing with his dad, staring into the camera.

Rolando said he had first been told by immigration authorities that the two would be deported together, so he agreed to go. Then, they told him his son would follow in two weeks. But months passed.

The boy's parents learned he took his first steps from the social worker, who also sent a video of him on his first birthday, waking up and crying. From the AP's news story on Johan's appearance before a judge, they learned that he had started to talk.

The father said he was overwhelmed by guilt over the dismal failure of his beautiful plan. Someday, he knows, his son will ask what happened, and why he had left him in the United States.

""I'll tell him the truth,"" he said. ""We thought we had a good plan to give him a better life.""

Will Rolando concoct yet another plan to reach America? He says only that he is a fighter and will work hard to survive, as he always has.

But he knows that his life and that of his family will never be the same.

""They broke something in me over there,"" Rolando said. ""This was never my son's fault. Why did he have to be punished?""

""I think that we have the grounds to do it,"" Ocasio-Cortez told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Wednesday, before changing the subject to the upcoming midterm elections. ""I think what really we need to focus on is that we are advocating for the policies to win in November.""

When pressed about her decision to support impeachment, Ocasio-Cortez pointed to Trump's potential violation of the emoluments clause, which forbids government officials from accepting payments from foreign governments.

""I think that there are serious grounds in violations of the emoluments clause from day one,"" she said. ""I think that is, first and foremost, one of the basic elements and violations.""

June 27, 2018

Only a handful of lawmakers, including Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) have publicly called for Trump's impeachment. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has pushed back against their efforts, stating that impeachment would fail if it was seen as partisan.

A majority of House members are needed for impeachment to move forward. Given the GOP's majority hold on Congress, it's unlikely this could occur under current circumstances. Some Democratic lawmakers are hopeful the midterm elections will flip enough seats in Congress to pave the way for impeachment.

Ocasio-Cortez on Wednesday stood by her desire to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement if elected to Congress in November.

""We absolutely do need to make sure that our borders are secure,"" Ocasio-Cortez said on CNN. ""But what we need to realize and remember is that ICE was established in 2003 right at the same time as the Patriot Act, the AUMF, the Iraq War -- and we look back at a lot of that time and legislation as a mistake now. And I think that ICE is right there as a part of it.""

""It's extrajudicial nature is based into the structure of the agency,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""We can replace it with a humane agency that is directed toward safe passage instead of the direction of the criminalization.""

Following her shocking victory Tuesday night, Ocasio-Cortez made the rounds on several morning news shows Wednesday. When asked on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" why she often refrained from calling out Trump directly during her campaign, Ocasio-Cortez said she felt it wasn't the best way forward.

""What we need to do is lay out a plan and a vision that people can believe in,"" she said. ""And getting into Twitter fights with the president is not exactly where we're going to find progress as a nation.""

The activist who caused the Statue of Liberty to be evacuated on the Fourth of July has been charged with trespassing, interference with government agency functions and disorderly conduct for scaling then icon of freedom.

She faces up to a year and a half in prison if convicted.

Manhattan federal prosecutors on Thursday charged Therese Okoumou, 44, with three misdemeanor counts for climbing to the base of the Statue of Liberty on Wednesday and resisting orders to come down as she straddled Lady Liberty's right foot.

They say the stunt deserves prison time because the protest caused a mass evacuation of Liberty Island and posed risk to the NYPD officers who were ordered to retrieve her.

Okoumou, a resident of Staten Island, will be presented in Manhattan federal court later today.

On Wednesday, Okoumou told investigators she was part of a group protest organized by Rise and Resist NYC to protest President Trump's immigration policies.

The activists unfurled a banner on Liberty Island less than an hour before her climb that read: ""ABOLISH ICE.""

Woods, a 14-time major winner in his first event since finishing second at the PGA Championship to fellow American Brooks Koepka, fired a final-round one-under par 70 to finish 72 holes on four-under 280 at Ridgewood Country Club.

Woods was asked whether his relationship with Trump, with whom he has played golf, was â€œprofessional or personal.â€

â€œWell, Iâ€™ve known Donald for a number of years,â€ Woods said. â€œWeâ€™ve played golf together. Weâ€™ve had dinner together. Iâ€™ve known him pre-presidency and obviously during his presidency.â€

Woods was then asked about how he would explain such a friendly relationship with Trump given his tightening of US immigration policies and ongoing feuds with NBA and NFL players.

Trump has objected to NFL players kneeeling during the national anthem as a method of protesting racial inequality and social injustice and revoked White House invitations to NBA clubs after players said they would not attend what had been traditional visits before trump took office.

â€œWell, heâ€™s the President of the United States,â€ Woods replied. â€œYou have to respect the office.

â€œNo matter who is in the office, you may like, dislike personality or the politics, but we all must respect the office.â€

Woods was asked if he had anything more to say regarding the state of race relations and discourse.

3SX4X51T81RY25O8I1P6F9LB5IIOAU,Brett Kavanaugh Will Probably Give Evangelicals Exactly What They Want,"The day that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her resignation from the Supreme Court in the summer of 2005, I was camping out at a Christian rock festival in Illinois with an anti-abortion activist group called Rock for Life. That morning, I was sitting in the dusty shade of the group's RV with the Rock for Life director, Erik Whittington, and his wife, Tina, when we heard the news.

""It might finally be time,"" Erik said, before scurrying off to meet with his all-male leadership team.

Several years earlier, Erik was a musician for bands in Portland, Oregon, with a girlfriend with an irregular menstrual cycle; his sanity, he told me, relied on her terminating a pregnancy each time her period was late. One night, he said, he was driving down an Oregon highway when he saw a minion of Satan, an actual monster, staring through him from the car next to his. That's how he became a born-again Christian. His work in the anti-abortion movement was a natural fit, a boomerang of shame from his past, but painted in the language of feminism he knew from his Gen-X punk days.

""We do it for the women"" was the mantra he shared from the stage throughout the festival, as Tina watched proudly, shushing her babies.

Tina explained to me that ""anything that hinders women in their God-driven calling to be givers of life hastens Satan's work."" That's real female liberation, she said, to give oneself to the Lord according to the Bible's guidance.

She is now a vice president of Students for Life, the nation's largest anti-abortion youth organization, which released a statement this week declaring President Donald Trump's pick for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, ""a bold choice.""

Kavanaugh is not an evangelical Christian. He is, however, a thriving alumnus of President George W. Bush's administration, the White House that best understood the vigorous political power of cultural conservatives. Their source document for understanding the rights of Americans is not the Constitution, but the New Testament.

Kavanaugh's ambitions flourished in a White House that labored to satisfy this powerful minority bloc that demands their beliefs be honored as the rule of law. His Yale University pedigree is a secular stamp on so-called religious liberty.

It doesn't matter how Kavanaugh prays, any more than how likable he is as a carpool dad. (I like Erik Whittington tremendously and am glad, all these years later, to see pictures of the kids on Tina's Facebook page.) What matters is how Kavanaugh interprets the prudence of precedence. The Federalist Society -- such a misnomer for a group that wants to throw human rights back to the feral back alleys of the states -- backs Kavanaugh. Other hardline anti-choice groups from Concerned Women for America to March for Life support him too. His stance on my right to determine my own fertility, and thus my own future, is obvious.

This is not only about abortion; it's about the desire to strip women of agency and give our men de facto power of attorney over our bodies, ourselves. For the evangelicals who form a minority of our country but the solid rock of the Republican base, gender roles can be understood in one simple Bible verse, Ephesians 5:22: ""Wives, submit to your husband as to the lord.""

This means women are not to be trusted. We do not know our own minds. It is the men in our lives who must draw the shape of our futures and govern whether we grow, birth, suckle and raise children. They must be our sponsors.

This is not only about abortion; it's about the desire to strip women of agency and give our men de facto power of attorney over our bodies, our selves.

If the trained ear listens closely, it can hear Ephesians 5:22 vibrate through the two most relevant cases to Kavanaugh's -- and our -- possible future relationship to Roe v. Wade.

Consider Garza v. Hargan, the 2017 case in which a 17-year-old undocumented immigrant wanted to terminate a pregnancy without having to secure consent from a family member. Kavanaugh's dissent laughed so heartily in the face of her choice -- the choice of a girl in ICE custody, who considered her circumstances to be hostile to motherhood and who was fleeing a land where abortion is not a legal option -- that you can practically read the spittle clinging to his words. ""Is it really absurd for the United States to think that the minor should be transferred to her immigration sponsor -- ordinarily a family member, relative, or friend -- before she makes that decision?"" Her protected right to an abortion on U.S. soil would only be honored if a sponsor could approve her choice.

In conservative Christianity, that approval, that sponsorship, exists within the ordained hierarchy of marriage. If a conservative Christian family follows the doctrine of wifely submission, a husband has dominion over his wife's womb. Evangelical marriage guides, a publishing cottage industry devoted to the creed of put out and shut up, double down on the Biblical inerrancy of Paul's letter to Timothy, which said, ""I permit no woman to teach or have authority over a man; she is to keep silent."" And per Ephesians 5:22, a woman must please the kangaroo court of her master bedroom (pay no attention, disciple, to evangelical faith as an unusually strong predictor for divorce).

If a conservative Christian family follows the doctrine of wifely submission, a husband has dominion over his wife's womb.

Conservative justices rarely question the Supreme Court's 1965 ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut, which found that states that banned married couples from buying contraceptives violated marital privacy. (The court would take another seven years to recognize the right to birth control for all other couples). In his then-progressive decision, Justice William Douglas wrote that to bring the law into the marital bedroom ""is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship."" That relationship, and what happens between its sheets, is a sanctified one, according to the evangelical reading of the Bible. Anything else is sin.

Chief Justice John Roberts, George W. Bush's pick to replace O'Connor, said in his 2005 confirmation hearings that he would support the Griswold ruling, and frankly could not imagine a scenario in which Douglas' decision would be in question. He did not offer comment -- or faith -- in the judicial safety of the Eisenstadt v. Baird, the 1972 ruling protecting contraception outside of the jurisdiction of marriage; Griswold was the most recent precedent to Roe he felt was secure enough to discuss in his hearings. We don't know yet whether Kavanaugh agrees.

If the newly remade Supreme Court rolls back reproductive rights all the way to Griswold, single women, and the growing number of unmarried couples, may lose the right to contraception. Griswold but nothing beyond it would create two separate classes of women of childbearing age: ones who can legally plan their families, and ones who can't. Women who have a legal right to privacy in their bedrooms and bodies, and women who don't. Or, in evangelical terms, those who live under the righteous dominion of a husband, and those who don't.

If the newly remade Supreme Court rolls back reproductive rights all the way to Griswold, single women may lose the right to contraception.

Should Roe be overturned, we'll see if Roberts was right about the inviolability of Griswold. Plenty of anti-abortion groups are also anti-contraception, believing that their god alone should determine when to conceive a life. Anything else, like Tina told me, is Satan's work.

The morning O'Connor resigned, opening the bench to Roberts, Tina and I were keeping an eye on her young son Justus -- pronounced ""justice"" -- as he played in the dirt near the Rock for Life tent. She was telling me about her first three births and the likelihood that her uterus might rupture the next time she got pregnant. Still, she would conceive her daughter later that year. Erik stopped by for a sandwich and a chat. When he left, she suggested I read a now-bestselling book called the Lies Women Believe and the Truth that Sets Them Free; it would transform my marriage, she said. ""What are the lies women believe?"" I asked her. ""Lies like 'I have my rights,'"" she said.

Trump's endorsement on Wednesday could help tip his supporters down South for Kemp against Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle in the closely fought race to face Democratic nominee Stacey Abrams this November.

The eventual winner will replace outgoing GOP Gov. Nathan Deal, who has backed Cagle, according to The Atlanta Journal Constitution

Both candidates responded to Trump's endorsement on Wednesday by offering their support for the President. Cagle said he had ""no hard feelings"" and implied he was a more loyal Trump backer in 2016, while Kemp said as governor he would ""unapologetically stand"" with Trump.

Tens of thousands of people have joined nationwide protests across the US over the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.

More than 630 events were planned, with protesters calling for migrant families split at the US border to be reunited.

Some 2,000 children remain separated from their parents, despite President Donald Trump bowing to public outrage and curtailing the policy.

Concerns remain that records were not kept linking parents and children.

Major protests took place in Washington DC, New York, and many other cities, using the hashtag #familiesbelongtogether. Marchers held placards calling for no more family separations and for the controversial immigration agency ICE to be abolished.

Trump defends 'smart, tough' agency

Analysis by Tara McKelvey, White House reporter, BBC News

The nation is deeply divided about immigration policy, and the president ignited the debate again with his tweets on Saturday.

From his golf resort at Bedminster, New Jersey, he defended the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Twitter, describing it as the ""smartest, toughest and most spirited"" of law-enforcement groups.

Meanwhile the movement to abolish ICE has been ""going mainstream"", according to some activists, and thousands have taken to the streets to protest the president's policies.

More than 100 protesters gathered near the president's resort (""My civility is locked in a cage"", said one of their signs). I drove past the protesters on my way to the resort where I spent part of the day. As demonstrations heated up in New Jersey and across the US, the president was doubling down on his effort to promote his hardline policies.

""It goes against everything we stand for as a country,"" one protester, Paula Flores-Marques, 27, told Reuters in front of the White House in Washington DC. President Trump was out of town.

In New York they chanted, ""Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here"". In Chicago, protesters marched to the local offices of federal immigration authorities.

The original Trump administration ""zero tolerance"" policy required authorities to arrest and detain anyone crossing the Mexico-US border illegally. That meant separating children from their parents and holding them separately.

Faced with a massive public outcry after recordings were published of distressed, crying children in detention centres, President Trump promised to ""keep families together"" in migrant detention centres.

But critics say the order did not address the issue of families already separated, leaving uncertainty over the fate of 2,342 children taken away from their parents between 5 May and 9 June alone. Earlier this week, a judge in California ordered the families to be reunited within 30 days.

It also still requires authorities to detain immigrant families, rather than release them with a court date to return.

What do the protesters want?

Organisers said they wanted to send a message to President Trump, prompted by concerns that he would renege on his executive order.

""We cannot slow down now since the court ruling alone isn't enough and could be overturned,"" said a statement on the movement's website.

As well as the reunification of parents and children, organisers called for an end to immigrant detention - even when families are kept together - and also planned to voice opposition to President Trump's travel ban targeting five majority-Muslim nations, which was upheld by the US Supreme Court earlier this week.

Demonstrations were also likely to focus on the shake-up of the Supreme Court after Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement last week, giving President Trump the opportunity to solidify a conservative majority on the country's top court.

Much of the uproar over the separation policy came after news organisations reported on children being held in cells, converted warehouses and desert tents around the country.

President Trump on Saturday defended the agency that played a central role in carrying out the separations - the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He told its employees: ""You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. So brave!""

Who is taking part?

Organisers issued instructions for people to dress in white, to represent peace and unity. The main march is taking place in Washington DC, but one of the people behind the movement, Anna Galland, said separate events were planned in 50 states.

Lead organisers of the march include the American Civil Liberties Union, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the National Domestic Workers Alliance.

A number of celebrities expressed their support, including actresses Julianne Moore, America Ferrara and Natalie Portman, and Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the hit musical Hamilton.

The protests are not the first against Mr Trump's immigration policy. Nearly 600 women were arrested on Thursday during a sit-in at a US Senate building against the government's migration policy. Actress Susan Sarandon was among those detained.

Many were draped in foil sheets to highlight the flimsy bedding given to migrant children held in border detention facilities.

What is the policy?

President Trump's ""zero tolerance"" policy has strong support among his key Republican support base. He has repeatedly defended the policy, saying it is simply enforcing the law.

Under a crackdown rolled out in May, all border crossers - including first-time offenders - are criminally charged and jailed.

In a series of separate incidents, Border Patrol agents kept numerous criminal aliens from successfully re-entering the U.S. after previous removals, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.

Agents arrested two 18th Street gang members in separate incidents in South Texas. In the first, Rio Grande City Station agents arrested a Honduran man near Roma. Elsewhere, Kingsville Station agents arrested a Salvadoran man about 80 miles inland, near Sarita. In both cases, biometric background investigations revealed the two men were members of the violent 18th Street gang.

In Donna, Texas, Weslaco Station agents apprehended a Mexican national after he illegally crossed the border. When agents investigated the manâ€™s records, they discovered a 2007 conviction in Hidalgo County, Texas, for indecency with a child. He received a three-year prison sentence for his crime.

Further up the highway, agents at the Falfurrias Station came across a Guatemalan national illegally present in the U.S. The agents conducted a background check which revealed a 2004 conviction in Redwood City, California, for sex with a minor. The California court sentenced the criminal alien to 45 days in jail and three years of probation.

Agents assigned to the Rio Grande City Station arrested a Salvadoran man after he illegally crossed the border. The agents transferred the Salvadoran national to the station for processing where they learned the man had been arrested by the Saint Paul Police Department in Minnesota for felony sexual contact in the third degree. A court convicted the foreign national to three years in prison and placed him on probation for 15 years.

Agents processed all of the criminal aliens and turned them over to Homeland Security Investigation who will hold them for prosecution on immigration violations. Illegal re-entry after removal is a felony punishable by a prison sentence of up to 20 years.

3I7SHAD35NESJ05YYIY9DEUG9JA7M2,Portland ICE facility protesters moved by Homeland Security agents in Oregon today,"Federal agents broke up a group of protesters early Thursday morning who had camped for several days in front of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland, Oregon, according to CBS affiliate KOIN-TV. Agents with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security then formed a human barricade outside the building and faced off with the protesters, who had backed up onto city property.

Later in the morning, cars with the department's Federal Protective Service replaced the barricade of agents.

The protest followed widespread outcry over the Trump administration's so-called ""zero tolerance"" policy toward illegal immigration, which had led to the separation of children from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border.

In Portland, the ICE facility had been shut down for eight days because of the protesters.

The U.S. attorney's office there said in a statement that agents started taking action to reopen the facility around 5:30 a.m., according to KOIN-TV. At least nine people were arrested, KOIN-TV reporter Trevor Ault reported on CBSN.

Some protesters' tents were dismantled, according to the station. Others, which were on city property next to the facility, remained up, Ault reports.

At least 100 people were involved in the protest, Ault reported. Written notices were distributed by federal officers earlier in the week warning that people would be arrested if they didn't leave federal property, KOIN-TV reports.

Protesters said that their long-term goal was to abolish ICE, Ault reports.

Mayor Ted Wheeler said he wouldn't assist the federal government in clearing out the area, Ault reports.

3MJ9GGZYO4OKVYZ3V3R98WI84MZA25,Trump complains of immigration's impact on European 'culture',"A few months ago, during French President Emmanuel Macronâ€™s visit to the White House, Donald Trump was reportedly critical of British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. When the Washington Post asked about the American presidentâ€™s comments, Trump said in a statement that â€œimmigration is destroying Europe as we know it and it is very sad to be witness to what is happening.â€

Not surprisingly, the Republicanâ€™s comments prompted speculation about a possible racial subtext. In his highly controversial interview with The Sun, a British tabloid, Trump was even less subtle.

Trump also spoke on immigration policy in the interview, saying that Europe was losing its identity and culture because of an influx of migrants. â€œAllowing the immigration to take place in Europe is a shame,â€ Trump said. â€œI think it changed the fabric of Europe. And unless you act very quickly itâ€™s never going to be what it was and I donâ€™t mean that in a positive way. So I think allowing millions and millions of people to come in to Europe is very, very sad. I think you are losing your culture.â€

When the American president talks about immigration, he tends to maintain a specific pretense: the concern is about illegal immigration, Trump says.

But once in a while, he abandons the pretense and offers a more candid assessment.

Update: At his press conference alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May this morning, Trump shared some related thoughts, saying, in reference to immigration, â€œI just think itâ€™s changing the culture. I think itâ€™s a very negative thing for Europe. I think itâ€™s very negativeâ€¦. And I know itâ€™s politically not necessarily correct to say that. But Iâ€™ll say it and Iâ€™ll say it loud. And I think they better watch themselves because you are changing culture. You are changing a lot of things. Youâ€™re changing security. Youâ€™re changing â€“ look at whatâ€™s happening. I mean, you take a look. I mean, look at whatâ€™s happening to different countries that never had difficulty, never had problemsâ€¦. I do not think itâ€™s good for Europe and I donâ€™t think itâ€™s good for our country.â€",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-complains-immigrations-impact-european-culture,"['Democratic', 'Strongly Republican', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Republican', 'Strongly Democratic']","['5', '5', '4', '4', '5']"
33TGB4G0LQZQBA19PS3JTR2W56KTXR,Trump again proves his contempt for (or ignorance of) the First Amendment,"Doubts about President Trump's commitment to Americans' freedom of speech began before he entered the White House. His ongoing attacks on the media seemed to suggest a misunderstanding or a lack of support for the First Amendment. And as recently as Wednesday morning, Trump took to Twitter to reignite his long-standing attack on the American professional football players who protest racism and police brutality.

But in a recent interview with the Daily Caller, a conservative media outlet generally supportive of the president, he suggested that Americans maybe should not be allowed to protest at all.

While discussing the Senate confirmation hearings of Brett M. Kavanaugh, Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, the president said:

""Iâ€™m amazed that people allow the interruption to continue. You know, there are some people that just keep screaming at the same people. In the old days we used to throw them out. Today I guess they just keep screaming. I thought Senator [Orrin G.] Hatch was good because he was very indignant at the interruptions by a woman that was up there that just kept going on and on. I donâ€™t know why they donâ€™t, why they donâ€™t take care of a situation like that, because itâ€™s terrible. I think itâ€™s embarrassing for the country to allow protesters â€” you donâ€™t even know which side the protesters were on. But to allow someone to stand up and scream from the top of their lungs and nobody does anything about it is frankly â€” I think itâ€™s an embarrassment.""

Protesters do get removed from the Senate chambers when they interrupt lawmakers. So it is not clear what more the president wants to happen to these Americans expressing their lack of support for the policies and politics of those whom Trump supports.

But the idea that these individuals' behavior is â€œembarrassingâ€ is what is most telling. Those protesting Kavanaugh's confirmation particularly are perhaps most embarrassing to Trump, because of their sheer number and the fact that some of their disapproval of the judge is directed toward the president. Many Americans, particularly those on the left, do not support Kavanaugh because of their belief that he will be an extension of the Trump White House.

What's also insightful about Trump's comments is that he seems to target his disgust only at those pushing back against conservative individuals. The same day that multiple protesters interrupted Kavanaugh's hearing, conservative activist Laura Loomer interrupted a hearing featuring Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, protesting what she perceives as bias at the influential social media company. But there was no response from Trump criticizing her behavior.

Far-right activist Laura Loomer just interrupted the House hearing and started shouting that @jack is a liar. Note how Rep. Long responded pic.twitter.com/XurpPXdP4K â€” Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) September 5, 2018

While regularly critical of activists on the left, be they protesting Confederate memorials or the president's immigration policies, Trump has yet to criticize those Americans who disrupt events to advocate for conservative positions on issues related to abortion, the military or other matters. This response to the First Amendment has led critics to conclude that Trump appears to support free speech when it can be used to support him â€” and that is not something one would expect to hear from the leader of the United States, particularly one that claims to love the Constitution.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/06/trump-again-proves-his-contempt-or-ignorance-first-amendment/,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Republican']","['1', '1', '1', '1', '1']"
3ZXNP4Z39S38DINDY6XUD1FR9RBL7V,"2 Texas Border Mall Robbery Suspects Were Deported Weeks Before Heist, Say Court Files","McALLEN, Texas â€” Two of the seven men accused of holding up a jewelry store inside a packed mall over the weekend were deported weeks before the attempted heist.



Over the weekend, seven men rushed the Deutsch &amp; Deutsch jewelry store at La Plaza Mall in McAllen, waiving what appeared to be handguns as part of a failed robbery, Breitbart Texas reported. The breaking of the glass display cases further escalated the situation as shoppers mistook the noise for gunfire. While the guns that the men are reported to have been fake, the response by law enforcement was real.

During their arraignment, all seven men claimed to be Mexican nationals. The municipal judge was forced to read the charges and set the bonds in Spanish. Breitbart Texas learned that three of the suspects were previously arrested by U.S. Border Patrol and later deportedâ€“two of them just weeks before the incident.

Federal court records revealed that Miguel Quintanilla Cardenas and Raul Alberto Rangel Rivera had been deported from the U.S. in late June. Both men were arrested on June 21 by U.S. Border Patrol near Nogales, Arizona. One day after their arrest, U.S. Magistrate Judges Jaqueline M. Rateau and D. Thomas Ferraro sentenced both men credit for time served and turned them over to immigration authorities.

Another suspect, Javier Olvera Ramirez, was previously arrested by U.S. Border Patrol in August 2013 in Laredo, Texas. He was sentenced to 20 days in jail and then turned over to immigration authorities for deportation.

Two of the other suspects in the robbery, who are also in the country illegally, were previously arrested in connection with a similar robbery in California where a team of 10 men stole approximately $4.1 million in designer watches. According to the Los Angeles County District Attorneyâ€™s Office, Zepeda Abner Posos and Brayan Oliver Melchor were part of the Koreatown neighborhood job.

37Y5RYYI0QNPWAOU0SYTJM6A316XSY,North Carolina's new backdoor legislative gerrymanders still give the GOP a big edge,"Under the old Senate map, the median seat backed Trump 58-40, but under the new one, he carried it 55-43â€”8 points to the right of his statewide win. That's still very bad for Democrats, but it's a bit less tough. However, while the old median point in the House favored Trump 54-42, the new one supported him 55-41, which is actually a bit worse. This means that, if Democrats want to take the barest of majorities, they're going to need to win at least some seats that backed Trump by double digits, which is a very tough task even in a good year.

To see how the Tar Heel State stacks up nationally, we've published a handy spreadsheet listing the median seat for every other state chamber where we have data. By this metric, North Carolina's state Senate has the ninth-strongest GOP lean in the country, while its state House ranks fourthâ€”and first among potentially competitive chambers.

The more immediate task for Democrats is picking up enough seats to break the GOP's three-fifths supermajorities, which Republicans have used to override veto after veto from Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and continue to pass their agenda. The GOP currently enjoys a 35-15 Senate majority and a 75-45 edge in the House, so Democrats need to net six Senate seats or four House seats to get to their goal.

Once again, we can compare the two maps by looking at Trump's 29th-best Senate seat and 71st-best House seat; this gives us an idea of the kind of seat Democrats need to capture to break the GOP's supermajorities. There was no real change in either chamber: Under both the old and new Senate maps, the 29th-best seat supported Trump 51-46; under the old House map, the 71st seat backed Trump 51-45, while he carried it 52-47 under the new linesâ€”scarcely any better.

Nevertheless, while the new maps still aren't great for Democrats, they may still do better in 2018 thanks to them. A number of Republican legislators will be running in redrawn seats that are home to many voters who are new to them (and vice-versa), so they may not benefit as much from the advantages of incumbency. Senate Democrats are also all but guaranteed to pick up the redrawn 16th District, an open seat that backed Clinton 58-40. Therefore, as long as they defend all of their incumbents (the reddest Democratic-held Senate seat went for Clinton 52-46), they'll be able to concentrate on flipping five seats instead of six.

Redistricting has also required us to do perform a little housekeeping. Candidate filing closed in North Carolina a few months ago, so in our spreadsheets, we've assigned every state legislator who is seeking re-election to the district they're campaigning for. In the Senate, a pair of Republicans are running for the same seat in two instances, so we list them both as the incumbents. Conversely, any seats without an incumbent running for them are listed as such.

However, we still assigned a party to every open seat in order to reflect the GOP's current 35-15 Senate majority and 75-45 House majority. To figure out which party holds each open seat, we looked through the incumbents who are not running for re-election and assigned them each to an open seat for our legislative open seat tracker, which is the same approach we took for assigning retiring congressmen to Pennsylvania's new congressional map; each open seat is ""held"" by the party of its retiring incumbent. In a few cases, we had no choice but to assign certain incumbents to a new seat that doesn't overlap with the seat they hold now; in these situations, we gave those incumbents the seat closest to their current district that didn't otherwise have a legislator assigned to it.

Under this formula, we've wound up with three GOP-held Senate seats that Clinton won and no Democrats in Trump territory. In the House, five Democrats represent Trump seats and an equal number of Republicans hold Clinton districts. Under the old map, four Senate Republicans represented Clinton districts, while in the lower chamber, there were three Clinton Republicans and four Trump Democrats (a fifth House member, William Brisson, won in 2016 as a Democrat in a Trump seat, but switched parties last year).

The Indianapolis Star's Tony Cook writes that the two longtime rivals frequently agreed with one another on stage and instead focused their fire on Braun, arguing his company imported auto parts from overseas and taking him to task for voting in Democratic primaries until 2012. Rokita did still attack Messer a few times, but it sounds like both congressmen trained most of their fire on Braun.

We haven't seen any polls here in months, but the congressmen seem to be behaving like Braun is the front-runner right now. Braun, a former state representative, started the race with little-name recognition, but he began advertising last year and never let up. We're still waiting on campaign finance reports from all the candidates, but the wealthy Braun may very well have the resources to outspend Rokita and Messer on the air in the final weeks. We'll see if the other two begin focusing on Braun in their final TV ads, or if they continue to just attack their two rivals about equally.

â— WI-Sen: Warning: heavy use of puns ahead. Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin's latest ad admits right up front that, ""This is going to be a cheesy ad. A very cheesy ad ... But then again, this is Wisconsin!"" and yepâ€”this is an ad about about Holland's Family Cheese business in Thorp Wisconsin, run by the Penterman family.

The spot features the Pentermans' children introducing the segment with the aforementioned warning about cheesiness. Baldwin then appears on screen to say how she fought ""federal bureaucrats [who] wanted to prohibit the use of wooden cheese boards, which help make tens of millions of pounds of cheese a year."" Cheesemaker Marieke Penterman then praises the senator for standing up for local businesses by blocking the proposed regulation.

â— WV-Sen: Mountain Families PAC, which has ties to the the Senate GOP establishment, recently began airing an ad to try to stop disgraced coal baron Don Blankenship from winning the Republican primary, and Politico now has a copy of the ad, which they report is part of a $700,000 buy. The commercial attacks ""convicted criminal Don Blankenship"" over how his mining company got caught pumping coal waste underground, which contaminated drinking water for thousands of West Virginians, while Blankenship installed a separate clean water line in his own mansion. The segment closes by asking, ""Isn't there enough toxic sludge in Washington?""

Gubernatorial

â— CO-Gov: Both Democrats and Republicans held statewide conventions (known locally as ""assemblies"") in Colorado on Saturday, though the most noteworthy developments came in the GOP race.

For Democrats, the vote played out largely as anticipated. Former state Treasurer Cary Kennedy won the party endorsement with the support of 62 percent of delegates, while Rep. Jared Polis was a distant second with 33 percent, enough to get him to the primary ballot. (Polis had also collected signatures, so if he'd failed to hit the 30 percent threshold at the convention, he might have still made it to the primary.) Former state Sen. Mike Johnston and Lt. Gov. Donna Lynne, meanwhile, did not compete at the convention and instead chose to gather signatures. Election officials have verified that Johnston has enough valid signatures to make the primary ballot, while Lynne's petitions are still being processed.

On the GOP side, however, things were definitely a bit crazier, though state Treasurer Walker Stapleton, the presumptive front-runner, won his party's endorsement by earning the support of 43 percent of delegates. That not only ensures him of a place on June's primary ballot but also gives him the top slot. And that can matter a great deal: Research by political scientists has demonstrated that appearing first on the ballot can add several percentage points to a candidate's vote totals, even in high profile races.

But while the outcome for Stapleton was expected, second place yielded a surprise, as former Parker Mayor Greg Lopez took 32 percent of the vote, just clearing the 30 percent threshold needed to advance to the primary. That, however, left some major players out in the cold, particularly state Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, who won a mere 6 percent. Coffman had chosen not to collect signatures, so along with businessman Barry Farah and Larimer County Commissioner Lew Gaiter, her campaign is now kaput.

Until last week, Stapleton had planned to collect signatures to make the ballot, but he'd also considered competing at the convention anyway in the hopes of blocking Coffman from winning enough support to move on. But on Tuesday, Stapleton took the unusual step of asking Colorado's secretary of state to toss the signatures his campaign had collected, charging that the company he'd hired, Kennedy Enterprises, had engaged in fraud. That left Stapleton with no choice but to make his case to convention delegates in order to keep his campaign alive, but he got some high-profile help at the last minute. Former Rep. Tom Tancredo and Rep. Ken Buck, who both have followings among party activists, both endorsed him in the days leading up to the assembly.

By contrast, things never seemed to go right for Coffman throughout her campaign. The attorney general spent months keeping the political world guessing about whether she would run for governor or seek re-election, and she only announced her plans in November. (While Stapleton only announced he was running in September, he telegraphed his plans long in advance.) Coffman then found herself having trouble raising money in the short amount of time she gave herself, amassing a meager $85,000 war chest at the end of last year. Coffman originally planned to collect signatures rather than go through the assembly, but she announced in February that she was switching course: Going the petition route can cost $250,000 in Colorado, money she simply didn't have.

But Coffman was always going to face as tough a time making inroads with the conservative delegates who dominate the convention as she had with donors. In particular, Coffman's stance on gay rights might place her in the American mainstream, but she was very much on the outs with right-wing activists: She'd taken part in a 2017 LGBT PrideFest event, and her office had appeared in a high-profile case before the U.S. Supreme Court to defend the state's decision to penalize a baker who had refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.

Coffman also described her position on abortion as ""a libertarian view that a woman should have a right to have an abortion that is legally guaranteed by the Supreme Court decision,"" which only further upset social conservatives. At the convention, Coffman used her speech to attack Stapleton for his petition problems and a DUI from the 1990s, which got her booed. In the end, Coffman's feeble 6 percent support from delegates meant a dramatic end for a campaign that never made much sense to begin with.

But former Parker Mayor Greg Lopez, whom we hadn't even mentioned before, had a very different experience. Lopez had just $23,000 in the bank in March, and his last campaign for public office went badly. In 2016, Lopez ran for the Senate, but his bid ended at the convention when little-known and under-funded candidate Darryl Glenn wowed the delegates with a speech and secured so much support that no one else competing at the assembly advanced.

But this time, it was Lopez who gave a strong speech that impressed delegates, some of whom admitted to knowing nothing about him when the day began. Lopez, who is the son of migrant farm workers, notably declared, ""Like President Trump, I support legal immigration, not illegal immigration,"" and portrayed himself as a ""different"" type of Republican candidate. (Interestingly, that approach followed a pattern laid down two years earlier by Glenn, an African-American whose biggest applause line was, ""All lives matter!"") Lopez probably still has too little money and outside support to win in June, but we'll see if his strong showing affects the landscape.

As with Democrats, though, two notable GOP candidates, investment banker Doug Robinson and wealthy former state Rep. Victor Mitchell, eschewed the convention. Both are still waiting to hear if they filed enough signatures to make the ballot, which they'll find out no later than April 27.

â— CT-Gov: While Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin formed an exploratory committee in December to prepare for a bid for governor, he announced on Monday that he would stay out of the August Democratic primary. Bronin had a bad relationship with labor, and he also struggled to make inroads in the crowded contest. It didn't help him that legislators who voted for the October bailout for Hartford now say they were misled about exactly what they were supporting, and some have threatened to cut off aid to the city.

â— GA-Gov: Former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams is out with her first TV ads (here and here) ahead of the May 22 Democratic primary. The first spot begins by showing family photos while Abrams introduces herself: ""Growing up, we didn't have much. But in my parents' house, Saturday was a service dayâ€”helping others."" Abrams says she wants to give more Georgians the opportunity to succeed so that ""all Georgia families are lifted up.""

The second spot features a diverse group of men wearing suits who one by one say that Abrams understands ""guys like me."" They argue she's fighting against tax hikes on hard-working people like them and advocating for better health care and education, while they also praise her as someone who can work with both parties to get things done.

â— MD-Gov: Former NAACP head Ben Jealous picked up the support of the Maryland State Education Association, the largest teachers' union in the state, for the June Democratic primary. Last year, the Baltimore Sun described the group, which has clashed repeatedly with GOP Gov. Larry Hogan, as one of the most coveted endorsements in the contest, and noted that they spent $2 million during the 2014 race.

â— NV-Gov: State Treasurer Dan Schwartz has debuted two fifteen-second ads (here and here) ahead of the June 12 GOP primary, which his campaign says are part of a six-figure buy. The first spot hurriedly says Schwartz won't take money from ""billionaires and their lobbyists,"" which probably explains why the production values look so cheap in both segments. The second ad says Nevada needs a governor who will create high-tech, high-paid jobs and build schools, not spend taxpayer money on a new stadium.

â— NY-Gov: Despite intense maneuvering by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York's Working Families Party overwhelmingly endorsed his progressive primary challenger, activist and actress Cynthia Nixon, at a gathering on Saturday. Prior to the proceedings, with a Nixon endorsement looking likely, Cuomo pulled out of the running.

At the same time, two influential unions supportive of Cuomo, the Communications Workers of America and SEIU 32BJ (which represents property services workers, including doormen and office cleaners), announced they would leave the WFP. Some other dissident unions also reportedly have suggested they might form their own ballot line which they could then give to Cuomo, but any such talks sound highly preliminary, and 32BJ made a point of saying it was not involved in them.

While Nixon's WFP nod has no direct impact on the outcome of September's Democratic primary, if the unions still remaining in the WFP choose to expend real resources to aid her campaign, that could give her a major boost. In 2014, when Cuomo also faced a primary challenger running to his left, law professor Zephyr Teachout, the WFP declined to back her after a bitterly divided party convention, leaving Teachout without the kind of institutional support she desperately needed to pull off an upsetâ€”and which Nixon likewise needs.

One reason the WFP spurned Teachout had to do with ballot access. For political parties in New York to retain their ballot lines, their candidates need to win at least 50,000 votes on that line every time there's a gubernatorial election. Usually the WFP cross-endorses the Democratic nominee, and thanks to New York's system of so-called ""fusion voting,"" whereby multiple parties can nominate the same candidate, hitting that threshold has never been a problem. But had Teachout won the WFP endorsement and lost the Democratic primary, it's possible she might not have received the necessary 50,000 votes that fall.

That's a risk that the WFP is evidently willing to take this time around with Nixon, who remains very much the longshot against Cuomo. But the WFP earned heaps of scorn for siding with Cuomo in 2014, and in the current political environment, siding with the notoriously centrist incumbent might have caused an even more tumultuous split in the party's ranks.

â— PA-Gov, PA-Sen: A new poll from Muhlenberg College for the Morning Call finds Pennsylvania Democrats in strong shape across the board, much as Franklin &amp; Marshall did late last month. In Muhlenberg's closest gubernatorial matchup, Gov. Tom Wolf leads state Sen. Scott Wagner 47-31; he holds even wider advantages of 47-27 against businessman Paul Mango and 46-26 versus attorney Laura Ellsworth. The big gaps are undoubtedly due in part to Wolf's name recognition advantage, but he also sports a positive 46-35 job approval rating.

The picture is similar for Sen. Bob Casey, who beats Rep. Lou Barletta 48-32 and state Rep. Jim Christiana 48-29 and has an approval score of 41-28. Trump, meanwhile, is deep underwater, with only 39 percent of voters approving of the job he's doing while 55 percent disapprove. That's a strong headwind for any GOP candidate but may just be insurmountable for Barletta, whom the Washington Examiner's David Drucker recently reported had been ""all but written off"" by his party.

There's one final piece of good news for Keystone State Democrats: On the generic congressional ballot, they lead Republicans by a wide 47-38 margin. Democrats could pick up as many as five GOP-held seats in Pennsylvania alone this year, as well as secure a sixth seat by winning an incumbent-vs.-incumbent battle in the 17th District, and these numbers suggest a sweep is within the realm of possibility.

â— TN-Gov: A new ad for Republican Rep. Diane Black rather oddly starts out by notingâ€”with a map, no lessâ€”that the country's ""southern border is 760 miles from Tennessee."" The message, apparently, is that Mexico is awful close, because the rest of the spot features Black herself describing how she'll crack down on the menace of immigration, but ""760 miles"" seems like a rather long haul. And that's only as the crow flies: The drive from Del Rio, Texas to Memphis, Tennessee (more or less the starting and ending points on Black's map) takes 13 hours and traverses 867 miles. Fear evidently knows no boundaries.

House

â— FL-15: GOP state Reps. Neil Combee and Ross Spano are each reportedly planning to announce a run for retiring Rep. Dennis Ross' seat in the next few days. However, state Sen. Kelli Stargel and state Rep. Ben Albritton each say they'll stay out of the race. Florida Politics also lists Lakeland City Commissioner Scott Franklin's name as ""in the mix"" for the late August primary, though we haven't heard anything else about his level of interest. The filing deadline is May 4.

â— FL-18: Former State Department official Lauren Baer has earned the endorsement of Rep. Ted Deutch, making him the second South Florida Democrat in Congress (along with Rep. Lois Frankel) to back Baer's campaign. In the just-concluded first quarter of the year, Baer raised an impressive $456,000 from donors and finished with $708,000 cash-on-hand. Her opponent in the August primary, Navy veteran Pam Keith, brought in $105,000 and had just $50,000 in the bank. Freshman GOP Rep. Brian Mast, by contrast, collected a monster $777,000 and has $1.5 million in his campaign account.

â— MD-06: Maryland's state Republican Party appears to be trying to ratfuck the 6th District Democratic primary by sending out mailers attacking state Del. Aruna Miller for supposedly being weak on crime, the opioid epidemic, and immigration. The state party isn't admitting its motivation for targeting Miller while ignoring the other Democrats in the field. However, a consultant for presumptive GOP nominee Amie Hoeber suggested Republicans would prefer to have the only woman nominee in the general election for this blue-leaning western Maryland district.

Miller is running in a primary field that includes two menâ€”self-funding businessman David Trone and state Sen. Roger Mannoâ€”along with one womanâ€”physician and novelist Nadia Hashimi, who has struggled to raise money. Miller has earned support from major Democratic-aligned groups like EMILY's List.

Republicans may believe they'd fare better in the general election running against Manno or Trone. However, this district backed Clinton by 56-40, and it's hard to see Republicans having a good shot against any of the top Democratic contenders in the 2018 political environment.

â— MN-02, MN-03: Democrats in these two suburban Twin Cities swing seats held their endorsement conventions on Saturday, and unsurprisingly, they backed both former healthcare executive Angie Craig and businessman Dean Phillips, two candidates who are on the DCCC's Red-to-Blue list.

In the 2nd District, Craig is seeking a rematch with GOP Rep. Jason Lewis, who beat her 47-45 as Trump was carrying the seat by the same margin. Craig's main intra-party opponent, high school football coach Jeff Erdmann, dropped out of the race after he lost the party endorsement. While the candidate-filing deadline isn't until June, it's unlikely Craig will face any serious opposition in the August primary. This will be another expensive battle: At the end of March, Lewis held a $885,000 to $750,000 cash-on-hand edge.

In the neighboring 3rd District, Phillips, who is heavily involved with local philanthropic efforts (and is also a grandson of famous advice columnist Dear Abby) defeated Tonka Bay Councilor Adam Jennings. As of Monday evening, Jennings hasn't publicly said if he plans to continue on to the primary. In any case, now that Phillips has the support of both national and local Democrats, it's hard to see him being in any trouble come August.

National Democrats are targeting GOP Rep. Erik Paulsen, who beat a well-funded Democratic opponent 57-43 even as Clinton was winning his seat 51-41. Paulsen remains a very strong fundraiser, and he held a $2 million to $700,000 cash-on-hand edge over Phillips at the end of March. For his part, Jennings had $151,000 on-hand, with most of his money coning from himself. However, Phillips will still have plenty of money to get his name out, and this is exactly the type of well-educated suburban seat Team Blue hopes will react badly to anything associated with Trump in November.

â— MN-08: After a hard-fought battle at Saturday's convention, none of the five Democrats competing to succeed retiring Rep. Rick Nolan in Minnesota's 8th District emerged with their party's endorsement, and Team Blue will now move on toward a crowded August primary for this competitive seat. Candidates needed the support of 60 percent of the delegates to win the endorsement, and while capturing this prize doesn't guarantee anyone the nomination, several contenders had pledged to drop out if they didn't earn the party's official backing.

On the 10th and final ballot, former FBI analyst Leah Phifer led former state Rep. Joe Radinovich, who was Nolan's 2016 campaign manager, by a 48-42 margin, while the remaining 10 percent of delegates voted not to endorse anyone. At that pointâ€”10 hours into the proceedingsâ€”convention-goers opted to adjourn without naming a victor.

Several other candidates also competed at the convention. North Branch Mayor Kirsten Kennedy and former local TV news anchor Michelle Lee were quickly eliminated on the very first ballot, after both failed to clear the necessary 5 percent to move on. State Rep. Jason Metsa lasted a little longer, but he got knocked out after taking just 18 percent on the third ballot, falling short of the 25 percent needed to continue at that point.

By Monday, Radinovich, Metsa, Lee, and Kennedy had all announced that they would continue on to the primary. Phifer, by contrast, said that she would take the next two weeks to decide if she'd do the same, though she sounds unlikely to, since she acknowledged her campaign had always been dependent on winning the party endorsement.

That's because she's likely to face much more intense opposition if she forges ahead to the primary. Phifer had kicked off a bid against Nolan last year before he retired, and the congressman and his allies reportedly wanted to do whatever they could to stop her from winning the party endorsement. Phifer's detractors have also worried that her opposition to local mining projects and her weak fundraising would harm Democrats' chances of holding this seat in the general election.

Phifer also ran into some static at the convention: The party's Latino Caucus protested her candidacy at the convention, since she'd previously worked for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal government's notorious deportation force better known as ICE. Nolan also endorsed Radinovich at the convention when he emerged as Phifer's only remaining opponent, though he said afterwards that he wouldn't support anyone in the primary until the field becomes clear.

Republicans, meanwhile, have consolidated behind St. Louis County Commissioner Pete Stauber in this rural seat in the northeastern part of the state, which swung from 52-46 Obama to 54-39 Trump. While some local Democrats hoped that one candidate could win the party endorsement and the others would just decide not to run in the primary, that's not happening. However, it's anyone's guess who will be favored in August.

Despite her success with activists, Phifer raised only $47,000 during the first three months of the year and ended March with $19,000 in the bank, so if she does stay in the race, she could have a tough time getting her message out to a larger electorate. However, Phifer did make a name for herself as the candidate most opposed to mining projects, which could help her stand out in a jammed race.

The other Democratic hopefuls only got into the race after Nolan announced he would retire in mid-February, so they haven't yet had a full quarter to raise money. In his limited time in the race, Metsa outraised the field with $133,000, and also had the most in the bank, $117,000. Radinovich took in $108,000 during this period and had $95,000 cash-on-hand. Lee took in just $29,000 for the quarter and had only $16,000 on-hand, though her long career on TV may afford her a measure of name-recognition. Kennedy, who raised just $6,000, and ended with less than $3,000 left over. For his part, Stauber raised $274,000 and ended March with $293,000 on-hand. (Update: This post incorrectly had Kennedy raising $62,000 and holding $27,000 on-hand.)

â— NY-24: Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand hasn't formally weighed in on the Democratic primary in the 24th District, but her Off the Sidelines PAC donated the maximum of $5,000 to Syracuse University professor Dana Balter's campaign during the first quarter. Balter has previously struggled with fundraising, although she raised $120,000 in the first three months of 2018 and finished March with $75,000 on hand. Primary rival Juanita Perez Williams, who was formerly the city of Syracuse's top attorney, only joined the race this month and thus has no fundraising report yet.

Meanwhile, Republican Rep. John Katko will be able to stockpile his cash while the two Democrats compete in the June primary. Katko raised $213,000 and had a hefty $1.2 million in cash-on-hand at the beginning of April.

â— WI-01: Over the last few days, both state Sen. David Craig and state Rep. Samantha Kerkman announced that they wouldn't run in the August GOP primary to succeed retiring Speaker Paul Ryan. The only major Republican left who has expressed interest in running is University of Wisconsin Board of Regents member Bryan Steil, a longtime friend of Ryan's. However, Wisconsin Politics lists former Racine County Executive Jim Ladwig as considering, though there's no other information about his level of interest.

39O0SQZVJOPJGGIQ3QUQZDOQF697RQ,Scott Morrison: Australia's conservative pragmatist,"Image copyright EPA

Scott Morrison has emerged as Australia's new prime minister after a chaotic week of political infighting and surprise twists.

A social conservative, Mr Morrison also appeals to the moderate elements of the Liberal Party and is widely recognised as a shrewd and pragmatic political engineer.

Although he did not initiate the leadership challenge against former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, he defeated the man who did, Peter Dutton, at the final pass.

He then went on to be thanked for his loyalty in Mr Turnbull's final speech as the country's leader.

Yet Mr Morrison - known as "" ScoMo"" around Parliament House - has long been seen to harbour leadership ambitions and was an obvious contender once Mr Turnbull's fragile alliances began to collapse.

Conservative rising

The 50-year-old is one of the country's leading religious conservatives and represents a deeply traditional heartland of Sydney.

He opposed the same sex marriage bill but kept a low profile during that debate - he ultimately abstained, a clear sign of his pragmatic approach when politics and personal beliefs collide.

But he rose to national prominence for vigorously enforcing Australia's controversial approach to asylum seekers, including the ""Stop the Boats"" policy, as immigration minister in Tony Abbott's government.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Morrison was heavily criticised as immigration minister, but lauded by his party for enforcing the policy

There was trenchant public criticism of the policy, but Mr Morrison proceeded with his severe approach to the portfolio and built a reputation as a tough operator. He remained unfazed by specific accusations about the lack of transparency over what was happening in Australia's offshore detention centres.

It's a reputation that wasn't helped by a precarious moment in 2011, when he was lambasted for a scathing attack on the Labor Government when it flew asylum-seeker relatives to their drowned children's funerals after a boat tragedy off Christmas Island. He apologised - only for the timing.

So when he changed portfolio to social security apprehension swept across Australia's community sector. But he softened his image and when the time came he helped Malcolm Turnbull secure the leadership in 2015.

He was rewarded with the treasury and is widely judged to have delivered a competent performance. Colleagues and opponents laud his work ethic and what they say is his clear communication and consultation with stakeholders.

The son of a police officer, he grew up in Sydney's beachside suburbs. He's seen as the proverbial ""family man"" who understands Australia's suburban conservative values and he is now closely connected to the Pentecostal movement. He married his wife Jenny when he was 21 and the pair have two children.

He has always been politically engaged and was a former state director for the Liberal Party. But he also held senior roles in tourism - he was a former managing director of Tourism Australia - before running for federal office in 2007 and finally entering the cut-throat political stage in Canberra.

35XW21VSVHWUWG75M9V58SBNWJKLS6,Can DACA Survive Its Latest Legal Attack in Texas?,"The judge overseeing the lawsuit in Washington, Judge John D. Bates of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, went even further on Friday by reaffirming an earlier ruling that essentially tells the government to reinstate DACA and start taking new applications from anyone who is eligible for the temporary status. But that does not mean young immigrants can start submitting their applications; the government has until Aug. 23 to appeal, and has signaled that it intends to fight.

Even before that date comes around, however, the fourth lawsuit, the one heard in Texas on Wednesday, could complicate matters even further. A group of nine states led by Texas sued to end the program permanently in May, after the California and New York judges had ruled in favor of the program. That lawsuit landed in front of Judge Hanen, who previously made his tough-on-immigration views clear when he ruled in 2015 against another immigration program the Obama administration had created as a companion to DACA. That program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, which was intended to shield some parents of American citizens and legal residents from deportation, never went into effect; the Supreme Court deadlocked over it in 2016, leaving Judge Hanenâ€™s decision in place.

What happened this week in the Texas case?

In Wednesdayâ€™s court hearing, lawyers for Texas said that the judge should issue a preliminary injunction ending the program. (The Trump administration refused to defend the program against Texasâ€™ lawsuit, leaving the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund to intervene on behalf of 22 DACA recipients.)

Texas is arguing that DACA is little different from the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, and therefore deserves the same treatment from Judge Hanen. But lawyers for Maldef pointed out one big difference: DACA, unlike DAPA, has already been in effect for years, they argued in court, and Texas has not been able to show that the program has harmed the state.

â€œTexas was not able to point to evidence that DACA recipients are costing the state anything, and in fact the evidence in the case is that by being able to work and live and participate in civic society and the economy, that Texas over all is better with DACA recipients,â€ said Nina Perales, the groupâ€™s lawyer.

But Todd Lawrence Disher, the Texas special counsel, said in court, â€œNo amount of economic activity makes lawful what is otherwise unlawful.â€

What does the future hold for the program?

There is more uncertainty ahead.

If Judge Hanen does issue an injunction forcing the government to freeze DACA, it could set up a clash between his ruling and those of the three other judges: The Trump administration could be under conflicting orders to end the program; to resurrect the program and allow new applications; and to keep the program but only for those already enrolled, allowing them to renew their two-year work permits. An appeals court is already considering the California case, and Judge Hanenâ€™s ruling, whatever it is, will probably be appealed to another appeals court. But those two appeals courts could rule differently.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/us/daca-texas-courts-immigration.html?hp&amp;target=comments#commentsContainer,"['Neutral', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Democratic']","['5', '5', '5', '5', '5']"
3XEDXEGFX46JB15BS70KJMSPC090KQ,Former ICE chief counsel sentenced to prison for stealing identities of illegal immigrants,"A former top U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement attorney has been sentenced to four years in prison in an identity theft case that victimized illegal immigrants facing deportation.

Raphael Sanchez, 44, ran up credit card and other bills totaling more than $190,000 in the names of his seven victims and carried out the scheme over a four-year period while serving as chief counsel of the ICE Seattle office, overseeing deportations in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.

""Sanchez was entrusted with significant authority to represent the United States in crucial immigration proceedings that deeply shaped the lives of many,"" prosecutors told the judge in court papers. ""Sanchez abandoned the principles he swore to uphold and used his authority merely as a vehicle for personal profit.""

Sanchez, who earned $162,000 a year, agreed to the sentence as part of a plea deal in February in which he admitted guilt to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft charges.

SEATTLE ICE ATTORNEY ADMITS TO STEALING IMMIGRANT IDS

â€œThe career that was my life is gone,â€ Sanchez said at the sentencing Thursday in Seattle Federal Court, according to The Seattle Times.

His attorney said Sanchez ""made choices that sabotaged everything good in his life"" and stole money he didn't really need to buy things he didn't really want.

During a pre-sentence interview with court officials, Sanchez said he struggled with money problems, depression, fatigue and a failed relationship before launching into his scheme.

""It became a perfect storm that did not allow me to see the hurtfulness and wrongfulness of my actions,"" he said.

3RWO3EJELIRKTHN91I9ST8XYBOL1P3,Ex-communist East Germany a hotbed for racist hate crime,"Berlin (AFP) â€“ Far-right mob violence targeting immigrants in the German city of Chemnitz has again cast an ugly spotlight on the countryâ€™ ex-communist east as a hotbed of xenophobia.

Extremist hooligans have vented their anger at foreigners, hunting some in the streets, since a German man was stabbed to death in the early hours of Sunday, allegedly by an Iraqi and a Syrian who were arrested Monday.

Especially the state of Saxony, where Chemnitz is located, has been a centre for resentful opposition against Chancellor Angela Merkel and her 2015 decision to keep open German borders to a mass influx of migrants and refugees.

Saxony state capital Dresden has long been an iconic city for German neo-Nazis embittered by the Alliesâ€™ aerial bombing of the Baroque city centre in World War II.

The city in recent years became the birthplace of the so-called PEGIDA movement, short for â€œPatriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the Occidentâ€.

â€œWe are the people,â€ the demonstrators chant regularly, co-opting the slogan of rallies before the fall of the Berlin Wall, and suggesting a righteous revolt against an out-of-touch political elite and the â€œlying pressâ€.

Earlier this month, Dresden again made headlines when an anti-Merkel PEGIDA follower argued with a TV team, which was then obstructed by police â€” a scandal that worsened when it turned out the protester was an off-duty police employee.

The anti-immigration and anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD) party also made some of its strongest gains in Saxony and the four other states that until 1990 were part of Soviet-allied East Germany.

Small towns such as Heidenau and Freital have earned nationwide notoriety as neo-Nazis and angry residents have hurled abuse at people fleeing war and misery â€” and rocks at police sent to protect those seeking a safe haven.

â€“ Xenophobic violence â€“

State leaders have cautioned against â€œstigmatisingâ€ the east, which despite a multi-billion-euro infrastructure overhaul still lags the former West in wealth, jobs and opportunities.

Yet a spate of arson attacks against refugee shelters, and swastikas scrawled on their walls, have brought back dark memories of xenophobic violence that flared at the time of Germanyâ€™s reunification over a quarter-century ago.

In the turbulent early 1990s â€” when East Germans got their first taste of democracy, but also faced economic collapse and uncertainty â€” the frustration exploded in sometimes deadly mob attacks against asylum shelters.

Historians point at other roots of entrenched far-right sentiment in the east, the only part of Germany where the neo-Nazi National Party of Germany (NPD) has seats in many town halls.

While West Germany was credited with dealing relatively openly with the Nazi era and Holocaust, the East German regime resisted â€œde-Nazificationâ€ in the Cold War and painted the Third Reich as an outgrowth of Western capitalism.

It termed the Berlin Wall it erected in 1961 to stop a massive popular exodus an â€œanti-fascistâ€ rampart.

The foreign-born population was minimal in East Germany, with the largest group some 60,000 labourers from â€œsocialist brother stateâ€ Vietnam, who would bear the brunt of racist attacks after the Wall fell.

It was the disenchanted right-wing extremist skinhead youth culture that, in the eastern state of Thuringia, spawned three neo-Nazis whose bloody crimes, when they finally emerged in 2011, would shock Germany.

The trio formed the National Socialist Underground â€” a secret extremist cell that laid bombs and shot dead nine people with migrant backgrounds as well as a policewoman, in post-war Germanyâ€™s worst racist killing spree.",https://www.breitbart.com/news/ex-communist-east-germany-a-hotbed-for-racist-hate-crime/,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['2', '1', '3', '1', '4']"
3KG2UQJ0MK6870VD6IMFQK0BJC3NQX,New Study Claims US Has Double the Amount of Illegal Immigrants Than Previously Thought,"Published last week, a new study challenged the widely held assumption that the United States had around 11 million illegal immigrants in the country.

While previous studies have relied on Census Bureau surveys, Yale and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers used a new model that looked at data like deportations and visa overstays.

Even with what the researchers described as a ""conservative"" model, they got a number that was 50 percent higher than what the Census Bureau reported. After running their model through 1 million simulations, the researchers estimated that the U.S. had 16 million to 29 million illegal immigrants.

The mean -- 22 million -- was double what researchers have assumed to be the number for years. That number came as the nation saw an aggressive immigration enforcement agenda under President Donald Trump -- who, as a candidate, cast doubt on the 11 million figure.

""It's always 11 million,"" Trump said just before the 2016 election. ""Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.""

Former Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Tom Homan reacted to the study on Monday, arguing that it ""gives the president more ammunition to say, 'Look, we need to fix this border.'""

The study drew criticism, however, from the Migrant Policy Institute (MPI) and the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), which both doubted that government data could have been so wrong for so long.

""Demographers have long agreed that the decennial Census undercounts unauthorized immigrants. But the 13.3 million number is highly implausible,"" the MPI, which peer-reviewed the study, said in a release.

Researchers, the MPC argued, acted on false assumptions and, in part, inappropriately applied data from the 2000s to estimate migration patterns during the 1990s:

However, crossing patterns were very different in the 1990s than in the mid- to late 2000s. In the 1990s, many migrants crossed multiple times in the same year, or they came for just a year or two before permanently leaving. Back then, illegal crossers faced few consequences, so little deterred them from coming, leaving, and returning again. As border enforcement increased strongly over the 2000s, resulting in higher smuggling costs and growing consequences for illegal entry (and in particular illegal re-entry), people who crossed illegally tended to remain in the United States. Therefore, in the 1990s, far more individuals were apprehended repeatedly than was the case in the 2000s. Applying 2005-10 apprehension rates to the 1990s leads the researchers to overestimate how many people crossed the border illegally in the 1990s.

MPI also said that the Yale-MIT study relied on departure rates for all immigrants rather than just those who were unauthorized to be in the United States.",https://ijr.com/2018/09/1126407-us-double-amount-illegal-immigrants/,"['Republican', 'Republican', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['5', '5', '5', '5', '5']"

Australia is overtaking the UK as the world's second biggest destination for international students, says research from University College London.

Researchers at UCL's Centre for Global Higher Education say the UK is being pushed into third place behind the United States and Australia.

Australia has been rapidly expanding its international student numbers.

The British Council says it shows the UK needs to ""look again"" at its policies towards overseas students.

An analysis this year found that overseas students added Â£20bn to the UK's economy - and universities in the UK have warned that immigration rules after Brexit will need to be more welcoming for students.

Catching up

The UCL study has tracked the latest movements in international students and report author Professor Simon Marginson says Australia is moving ahead of the UK.

He warns that Canada is also catching up in taking a growing slice of the lucrative overseas student market.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Overseas students starting in Melbourne this year were invited to a welcome party and dance

Three years ago the UK was recruiting around 130,000 more overseas students than Australia, says Prof Marginson, who is also co-chair of the Higher Education Commission's current inquiry into international students.

But he says successive years of Australia having increases of 12% to 14% in overseas students have seen it catch up and overtake the UK, which has been growing much more slowly.

Official student figures for 2018 from the UN's education agency, Unesco, will not be published until after the end of this year.

But the UCL researchers are ""certain"" that Australia is on the verge of moving ahead of the UK in overseas students and this ""may have already happened"".

Best student cities

""UK higher education is still highly valued internationally, but the government has held down the growth of international student numbers for five years, by limiting new student numbers and post-study work visas,"" says Prof Marginson.

""Meanwhile, competitor nations are strongly promoting their international education.""

Australia has been marketing itself as an English-speaking country with high-performing universities, with an attractive climate and a welcoming culture for overseas students.

This year's Best Student Cities rankings put Melbourne and Sydney in the top 10 - although London was the highest ranked of all.

Australia has succeeded in attracting students from outside Europe, particularly from China.

The research from UCL warns that the UK's future intake of international students will depend on keeping its appeal for European students.

Post-Brexit plans

Last week, the government set out post-Brexit plans that would keep open the door to visa-free travel for European Union students coming to UK universities.

But there was no detail on whether EU students would have to pay full international fees.

Universities in the UK have been campaigning for overseas students to be taken out of net migration figures.

A spokeswoman for the British Council said that international students are ""an immense source of long-term influence and soft power for the UK"".

She said the UK was competing with countries with ""welcoming visa policies"" and ""comprehensive international education strategies"".

With the approach of Brexit, she said ""it has never been more important to reinforce and open up international channels for the UK"".",https://bbc.com/news/education-44872808/#comp-comments-button,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Democratic']","['2', '3', '2', '1', '1']"
3WKGUBL7S04BUV5UW8ZNAPVHIPLL4B,Massachusetts primary elections a test for incumbents across the state: A look at the races to watch,"Itâ€™s primary day in Massachusetts, and several races have the potential for upsets and fresh faces.

Several members of the stateâ€™s all-Democratic U.S. House delegation faces spirited challengers, including those within their own party. Thereâ€™s also a battle to unseat popular Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and a move to replace Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Read on for a look at key races to watch on Sept. 4.

Governor

Republican Gov. Charlie Baker is running for re-election in the typically deep-blue Massachusetts. Often considered to be one of the most popular governors in the U.S., Baker faces Scott Lively in the GOP primary.

Baker has distanced himself from President Trump and hasnâ€™t been afraid to criticize the administration. Heâ€™s signed laws to protect abortion rights and has supported more gun control and a minimum wage increase.

Lively, on the other hand, is a pastor well known for his anti-gay sentiments. He said he is anti-abortion and is running against Baker to â€œbring Biblical values back into the political arena hereâ€ on his campaign website.

MASSACHUSETTSâ€™ GOP GOVERNOR AVOIDS LIBERAL BACKLASH TO TRUMP, EYES RE-ELECTION

For the Democrats, environmentalist and activist Bob Massie and Jay Gonzalez, the former secretary of administration and finance under Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick, are going head-to-head in Tuesdayâ€™s primary. But neither candidate has much name recognition outside Democratic activist circles.

Fox News has ranked the gubernatorial election as leaning Republican.

Senate

Sen. Elizabeth Warren doesnâ€™t have any Democratic challengers, but there are a handful of Republicans hoping for a chance to unseat the longtime liberal lawmaker including: state Rep. Geoff Diehl, businessman John Kingston and Beth Lindstrom, a former official under Gov. Mitt Romneyâ€™s administration.

All three have accused Warren of focusing too much on fighting with Trump and not enough on the state.

â€œPeople know that sheâ€™s done nothing for Massachusetts,â€ Kingston told The Associated Press. â€œGod bless her if she wants to run for president â€“ then go run for president and donâ€™t pretend that youâ€™re not.â€

Lindstrom, too, criticized Warren when she was endorsed by the New England Benevolent Police Association, saying the Democrat is â€œout of touch with the people sheâ€™s supposed to represent.â€

â€œItâ€™s time for us to tell our politicians to stop disrespecting our points of view and start reflecting our values,â€ Lindstrom said. â€œThese values include respecting the work of people in our criminal justice system.â€

FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTIONS HEADQUARTERS

Warren is one of several Democrats who have called for the abolishment of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency â€“ a federal group that has come under fire particularly under the Trump administration.

Of the three Republicans, itâ€™s Diehl who has been quick to embrace Trump as opposed to his opponents. Diehl co-chaired Trumpâ€™s 2016 Massachusetts campaign â€“ something heâ€™s quick to bring up to voters.

Lindstrom has said sheâ€™ll support Trump when itâ€™s â€œright for the people of Massachusetts.â€ And Kingston has promised to â€œwork with the administration when itâ€™s actually doing good things for Massachusetts.â€

Fox News has ranked the Senate race as likely Democrat.

House

All eyes are on Ayanna Pressley, a Democratic candidate for House who could become the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts.

Pressley â€“ who has drawn comparisons to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young, progressive New Yorker who unseated longtime Democratic incumbent Rep. Joseph Crowley earlier this year â€“ is challenging Rep. Michael Capuano in the 7th congressional district.

Capuano, a 66-year-old Democrat, has served in his seat since 2013.

Pressley is a Boston city council member â€“ and was the first woman of color to be elected to that legislative body, according to her campaign website.

â€œI know our â€¦ campaign is one that is disruptive and makes a lot of people uncomfortable in a dark blue district where we donâ€™t primary Democrats, but I think we are in different times,â€ Pressley told Elle magazine. â€œThese are times that require bold activist leadership and a reliable vote.â€

Whoever wins the primary will likely win the general election. No Republicans are running in this district.

MASSACHUSETTS DEMOCRAT CALLS TO IMPEACH JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS IN PLAN TO COMBAT SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

Another congressional race worth watching is the 3rd district, where 10 Democrats are fighting to take over the seat being vacated by incumbent Rep. Niki Tsongas. A Democrat, Tsongas has held the seat â€“ once also held by her late husband â€“ since 2013.

Running are Jeff Ballinger, a global workers rights activist; Alexandra Chandler, a former U.S. Naval intelligence officer and the state's first transgender congressional candidate; Beej Das, a constitutional lawyer and hotel developer; Rufus Gifford, a former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark; Leonard Golder, a former Stow selectman; Dan Koh, former chief of staff to Boston Mayor Marty Walsh; Barbara L'Italien, a state senator; Bopha Malone, a former bank executive; Juana Matias, a state representative; and Lori Trahan, who served as chief of staff to former Democratic Rep. Martin Meehan.

L'Italien made headlines during her campaign when she released a comprehensive plan to combat sexual misconduct in public office â€“ which included a plan to impeach Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and to open a congressional hearing into allegations against Trump.

She also accused Koh of not helping a former city employee who accused her boss of sexual harassment. Kohâ€™s campaign brushed off her accusations as â€œfalse personal attacks.â€

There is only one Republican gunning for the seat: business owner and founder of the conservative Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance Rick Green.

Kylian Mbappe of France celebrates after scoring his teamâ€™s third goal during its World Cup Round of 16 match against Argentina in Kazan, Russia, on June 30. (Catherine Ivill/Getty Images)

Afshin Molavi is co-director of the emerge85 Lab and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Institute of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.

When the French national team electrified the world two decades ago with a 3-0 drubbing of powerhouse Brazil in the World Cup final, Kylian MbappÃ© had not yet even been born. On Saturday, the 19-year-old French striker accomplished a feat that only one other player has ever achieved: scoring two goals in a World Cup match as a teenager.

The other player to achieve that milestone? The Brazilian legend, Pele, back in 1958 when he first stormed onto the international stage. Not bad company for the son of a Cameroonian father and Algerian mother, who grew up in Paris suburbs idolizing Portugalâ€™s Cristiano Ronaldo.

While MbappÃ© is an unusual talent, his background as the son of first-generation immigrants to France makes him a typical French national team player. Indeed, 17 players on Franceâ€™s 23-man roster at this yearâ€™s Cup are the sons of first-generation immigrants. Other successful European squads are also stacked with talent from sons of immigrants or recent migrants themselves, notably Switzerland and Belgium.

That famous French squad that thrust the FIFA trophy into the air in Paris in 1998 was noted for its diversity. The French tricolors, it was said triumphantly at the time went from white, blue and red to â€œblack, blanc, et beurâ€ (black, white, and a term for Arabs of North African descent).

During the celebrations that ensued, French political leaders hailed the victory of â€œLes Bleusâ€œ â€” as the national team is known â€” as not just a win on the football pitch, but a win for the â€œFrench modelâ€ of diversity and inclusion. The venerable Le Monde called the team a â€œsymbol of the diversity and unity of the country.â€ Les Bleus cast a golden glow on France in that shining moment.

It did not last. On the back of an anti-immigrant backlash, far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen captured a hefty 17 percent of the vote in the first round of the presidential election in 2002 â€” a reminder that sports can only go so far in healing deeper societal rifts. Le Pen had earlier complained that the teamâ€™s multiracial identity did not look French enough for him. While Le Pen was soundly defeated by Jacques Chirac in the runoff, the anxiety over immigrants that he channeled has accelerated over the past decade and a half across Western democracies, as immigration has risen alongside middle class economic insecurities.

While the World Cup has taken center stage of the sporting world this summer, the immigration debate has taken center stage in European politics. German Chancellor Angela Merkelâ€™s government nearly collapsed over divisions among her coalition partners on immigration. In Britain, unease over large numbers of migrants helped fuel the vote to leave the European Union. And in France, the National Frontâ€™s Marine Le Pen put up a more formidable fight than her father during her 2017 loss to President Emmanuel Macron, capturing a third of the French electorate. She, too, famously lamented that â€œwhen I look at Les Bleus, I donâ€™t recognize France or myself.â€

It goes on. The Swiss (yes, the Swiss!) voted in an anti-immigrant party to lead its parliament three years ago; Italyâ€™s populist far-right League threatened mass deportations of illegal immigrants during its 2018 political campaign. The League won the most votes, and formed a coalition government alongside the populist left Five Star Movement.

Italian soccer fans have also been among the most racist toward African players. The president of the Italian football federation once lamented the â€œbanana eatersâ€ populating Italyâ€™s professional leagues. Italy ranks low among European squads in terms of first-generation immigrants donning the national jersey. (The Italian side failed to qualify for the World Cup this year.)

Meanwhile, the latest multicultural team turning heads is Belgium, with a small population of only 11 million. Loaded with talented and hard-working sons of first-generation migrants from Congo, Morocco, Burundi, Mali and beyond, Belgium came into the tournament as worldâ€™s No. 3 team. On Friday, the Belgians advanced to the semifinals with a 2-1 victory over Brazil, and will play France on July 10.

Belgiumâ€™s soccer transformation is the most talked-about revitalization program in the game. A grass-roots transformation began in the early 2000s, with an emphasis on technical skills and nationwide youth development. This coincided with a national program to use soccer to help integrate recent migrants. It proved to be a potent mix, and the so-called â€œgolden generationâ€ of Belgian players born of that era are playing starring roles in top-flight European leagues.

On Monday, however, the Red Devils, as they are known, stared into the abyss. A scrappy Japan side shocked the Belgians with two quick goals to start the second half of their Round of 16 game. Keeping steady, the Belgians pulled off one of the greatest comebacks in World Cup knockout stage history, scoring three times during a furious 30 minutes of soccer that will long be remembered in the annals of â€œthe beautiful game.â€

On the winning goal, the star striker, Romelu Lukaku, the son of Congolese migrants, played decoy, letting the ball slip through his legs as Nacer Chadli, the son of Moroccan migrants, slid down the left side and converted the game winner. Earlier, the game-tying goal was headed in by another son of Moroccan migrants, Marouane Fellaini.

The Belgian national team have not only become a multicultural symbol, much like Les Bleus of the late 1990s, but they have become a powerful unifying force in a famously fractious country. The predominantly Dutch-speaking Flanders region of the north has made repeated calls for seceding from the rest of the country, and the Belgians are among the least nationalist in Europe. The country is seemingly always on the verge of breaking up and, as Cas Mudde, a specialist on populism in Europe at the University of Georgia writes, pro-Belgium parties â€œhave always looked to the Red Devils to boost the Belgian spirit of its compatriots.â€

In Belgium, traditional immigration anxiety has mixed with terrorism fears after the 2016 Brussels bombing led by homegrown Islamist extremists killed 32 people and shocked the country. The neighborhood where the terrorists hailed from, Molenbeek, in Brussels, is full of first-generation sons and daughters of migrants of North African descent. A conservative Islamist political party running for Belgian municipal elections next fall has only exacerbated anxieties in certain quarters about the rise of Islam in the country.

The Red Devils, like Franceâ€™s Les Bleus, will not be able to solve their nationâ€™s problems. But as Europeâ€™s immigration debate heats up, the Belgian squad can point the way toward an ideal of successful, merit-based integration while boosting national pride as they play sublime soccer before billions of viewers.

Sources tell CBS News 46 subpoenas went out in all, but of that 46, two went to state agencies, including the Department of Motor Vehicles. ICE is not providing a formal statement due to the ongoing federal investigation.

Those subpoenas come on the heels of an announcement last month that 19 foreign nationals had been indicted for illegally voting in the state during the 2016 election.

A federal law enforcement official briefed on the details of the investigation said this is a local case, and denied that it has anything to do with President Trump's unsubstantiated claims that there was widespread illegal voting during the 2016 election. But ICE and government officials are expecting to field questions about whether this is an attempt to pick up where the president's now-disbanded ""Commission on Voter Fraud"" left off.

The president, claiming ""millions"" voted illegally in the 2016 election, established the commission to root out fraud. The president disbanded the commission at the turn of the year. A report from the commission issued last month found no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 elections.

Absentee voting is scheduled to start in just over two weeks.

A federal law enforcement source tells CBS News' Jeff Pegues that the subpoenas are grand jury subpoenas, and potentially cover millions of documents, but investigators are not expecting to get that many. What they are essentially seeking, the federal law enforcement source says, is preservation of voter records. Sources tell Pegues the state destroys voting records after two years â€” and the two-year anniversary of the 2016 election is nearly here.

According to CBS Raleigh affiliate WNCN-TV, the subpoena requests ""any and all poll books,e-poll books, voting records, and/or voter authorization documents, and executed official ballots (including absentee official ballots), that were submitted to, filed by, received by, and/or maintained by the [redacted] County Board of Elections from August 30, 2013 through August 30, 2018.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-spurs-subpoenas-44-north-carolina-elections-boards-for-voting-records/,"['Neutral', 'Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Neutral', 'Republican']","['1', '3', '2', '1', '3']"

ELIZABETH, N.J. â€” Three or four times a week, Brandi Davison-Edralin steps into her 2002 Volvo and drives 25 miles from her home to the federal immigration detention center in northern New Jersey.

She gets in line and waits, sometimes up to 90 minutes, to enter a visitors' room where she sees her husband, Edralin, for an hour before he is sent back to his cell.

They talk about their children and their softball games, and about things that need to be done around the house in Highland Park now that Edralin, 47, isn't around to do the handiwork. And inevitably, Edralin â€” a green card holder whose detention was triggered by an 11-year-old conviction for possessing a pistol that fires plastic pellets â€” frets about his legal battle to avoid deportation to the Philippines.

â€œWhen they hear about immigrants in detention, the assumption is theyâ€™re illegal,â€ said Davison-Edralin, 45, a U.S. citizen. â€œItâ€™s not a black and white situation. The general publicâ€™s ignorance is so frustrating to me.â€

â–º July 2017: Woman gets judge job before becoming citizen. Now she's both.

The Edralins' new ritual is a byproduct of federal immigration policy under the Trump administration, which has targeted not only undocumented immigrants but also green card holders and other legal immigrants for deportation often on the basis of decades-old convictions. Now the administration is considering a policy that would broaden the pool of legal residents at risk of deportation by punishing those who have used food stamps, Medicaid, transit subsidies and other forms of ""public welfare"" to which they are entitled.

The U.S. government issues more than a million new green cards every year, according to data from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. By some estimates, nearly 20 million green card holders live in the country; nearly 1.2 million green cards were issued in 2016, the most recent year available.

â€œThis is shockingly weird for the government to be playing the morality police on things that happened a long time ago. It's clearly not because of the concern for the safety of the public.â€ The Rev. Seth Kaper-Dale, the Reformed Church of Highland Park, New Jersey

Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not track how many green card holders are deported, a spokesman said. But several stories have surfaced in mediareports of green card holders and undocumented immigrants with long-resolved, often low-level convictions â€” or no convictions at all â€” being detained.

""This is shockingly weird for the government to be playing the morality police on things that happened a long time ago,"" said the Rev. Seth Kaper-Dale of the Reformed Church of Highland Park, which has provided sanctuary to undocumented immigrants that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has targeted. ""It's clearly not because of the concern for the safety of the public. They're concerned with racially and ethnically cleansing this country.""



Edralin entered the United States on a green card in 1988 and was able to renew it repeatedly, even after an arrest on drug and firearm possession charges in January 2007. He was convicted of unlawful possession of an airsoft pistol, which fires plastic pellets, and was sentenced to probation, according to New Jersey criminal court records.



Davison-Edralin said her husband completed his sentence and also paid several fines.

Neither had given the incident much thought until he was arrested June 4 as he was leaving home to go to his new job as a machinist.

â€¢ In late 2016, immigration authorities flagged Isidro Quintana, a Mexican green card holder from Aurora, Colorado, while he was traveling because of a 1996 marijuana-related conviction, according to Denverite, a news website. ICE agents detained him after President Trump took office in 2017.

Quintana had other charges, including a 1996 domestic violence conviction. An immigration judge granted him a reprieve from deportation in May 2017.

A receptionist for Quintana's lawyer, Weldon Caldbeck, confirmed he worked on the case but said he wasn't available for comment.

â€¢ In January, a 43-year-old Polish doctor and green card holder, who came to the United States with his family when he was 5, was arrested in Michigan after dropping off his daughter at school. The doctor, Lukasz Niec, had two misdemeanor convictions from 1992 though the arrest was triggered by a child abuse investigation against him.

A federal judge dismissed those allegations in April, the Kalamazoo Gazette reported.

â€¢ In June, a Mexican green card holder who lives in Los Angeles, Jose Luis Garcia, was detained and placed in deportation proceedings over a 2001 domestic-violence-related misdemeanor. Three weeks after his arrest, Garcia's deportation case was closed, and he was released.

Carl Shusterman, an immigration attorney based in Los Angeles, said these cases and others suggest that Trump is as interested in restricting legal immigration as he is in addressing the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country.

""The thing he (Trump) is really devoting his attention to is cutting legal immigration,"" Shusterman said. ""You could probably ask any attorney in the country and they will tell you the same story.""

Edralin had several people submit affidavits vouching for him in his deportation case, including Kaper-Dale of the Reformed Church of Highland Park, a county law enforcement official, and some of Edralin's relatives.

Family members say the judge did not read the packet because she didn't have time. Instead, she denied Edralin's request to be released on bond because his 11-year-old conviction made him a threat to the public.

""We were stunned that she just said, 'No, no bond; he's a danger to society,' 11 years after the crime and not looking at anything current,"" Davison-Edralin said.

Edralin's case signals a shift in immigration enforcement. Trump's predecessors prioritized undocumented immigrants who had been convicted of serious crimes or were deemed to pose a national security threat for deportation.

But penalties for green card holders with criminal records didn't start with Trump. They date as far back as the late 1980s.

Shusterman, who worked for the federal government in the late 1970s and 1980s, said immigration agencies started examining green card holders' records more closely after a 1988 law introduced the idea of ""aggravated felonies.""

At first, aggravated felonies included serious crimes such as murder, drug trafficking and trafficking of firearms and destructive devices.

However, immigration laws passed in 1990 and 1996 expanded the definition to include crimes that immigration lawyers say are neither aggravated nor felonies.

""If you committed an aggravated felony sometime ... you can never show good moral character for immigration benefits for the rest of your life,"" immigration officials are saying, according to Shusterman.

""Things have gotten so much tougher,"" he said.

It's unclear whether Edralin's conviction would be considered an ""aggravated felony"" or a less severe category known as a ""crime or moral turpitude."" Not until he was arresteddid he realize he was a target for deportation.

Joanne Gottesman, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said the laws aren't any different from under previous administrations, but the enforcement strategy is new.

""I think that the difference with prior administrations is there was a use of discretion in certain circumstances that isn't being applied today,"" said Gottesman, who runs the Immigrant Justice Clinic at Rutgers.

Someone facing deportation over an old conviction, even for an aggravated felony, ""doesn't get a chance to go before the judge and say: Let me tell you the ways that I have been rehabilitated, the deep ties I've had in the United States,"" Gottesman said. ""What the statute does is prevent the judge from hearing anything the person has to say.""

Edralin's arrest complicated his family's finances. Davison-Edralin, who works full time, has covered most of her husband's legal costs, but those fees and daily household expenses have drained their savings.

""The big thing about him being there â€” I've come to terms with that. We'll deal with it,"" she said. ""But then the lawn mower broke. He would normally be the one to fix that. ... It's the things you don't think about that you deal with from day to day.""

Chariza Edralin, Cloyd Edralin's younger sister, started a crowdfunding campaign to help cover the family's legal fees and daily expenses. The family is also hosting a fundraiser Tuesday in Asbury Park.

â€œThe difference with prior administrations is there was a use of discretion in certain circumstances that isn't being applied today.â€ Joanne Gottesman, Rutgers Immigrant Justice Clinic

""The family support keeps me going, the community and friends,"" Chariza Edralin said. ""We are very, very fortunate to have really close-knit friends and family who are very supportive.""

In the meantime, family members and friends continue to visit Cloyd Edralin nearly every day at the Elizabeth Contract Detention Facility.

Cloyd Edralin tells his wife and his sister about life in the detention center. He gets cold, so he used money that Davison-Edralin deposited in his account to buy a sweatshirt and an extra shirt from the commissary to keep warm.

Some of the inmates he meets don't have anyone to visit them, send them money or represent them in immigration court. At her husband's request, Davison-Edralin said she put money in a few of the other inmates' commissary accounts.

Chariza Edralin, who visits her brother at least once a week, has heard the stories about the other inmates. She said she makes an effort to be upbeat though at some point they reflect on the birthdays, anniversaries and other milestones he's missing.

""I'm trying to be positive and optimistic about this whole thing,"" she said. ""But just considering the fact that in America, this country is basically all about immigrants, and how we're treating a certain type of immigrants and a collection of immigrants right now, it's embarrassing.""

3T2HW4QDUWPJOXH00Q2FOEGAAJF9CV,The Goutte dâ€™Or â€“ emerging design hub of Paris,"â€œWhat I really like is the feeling of being in a village,â€ said furniture designer Fabrice Daigremont. â€œEveryone knows each other. If you need advice or to borrow a tool, you can just pop into one of the other workshops and someone will be able to help.â€ Daigremont, who designs and makes high-end lamps, tables and stools alongside his work as an architect, is talking about the Goutte dâ€™Or district of north Paris, where he has a showroom and workshop.

Itâ€™s just a few minutesâ€™ walk from the tourist-choked cobbles and souvenir shops of Montmartre, but could be a different world.

The Goutte dâ€™Or is a burgeoning creative hub, with young jewellery and fashion designers setting up shop next to textile workshops, fashion and accessories boutiques, makers of leather goods and upmarket furniture, like Daigremont.

Fashion label Maison ChÃ¢teau Rouge is another brand based in the area that has taken off, with its blend of African culture and contemporary cuts. The label has recently created a clothing and homeware line now being stocked in major French chain Monoprix.

But design hub is just one of the Goutte dâ€™Orâ€™s identities: itâ€™s also one of the last surviving traditional working-class neighbourhoods in the French capital, albeit one whose streets are fast gentrifying.

And itâ€™s known as â€˜Little Africaâ€™ thanks to a decades-long wave of immigration from former French colonies that has lent the area a cosmopolitan vibe: tiny restaurants serve up chicken in peanut-based mafÃ© sauce from Mali and spicy Senegalese fish stew, bissap (hibiscus) and plantain are on offer in the open-air market and fabric shops piled high with the traditional and colourful West African â€˜waxâ€™ fabrics, decorated with lively batik prints, brighten up the Parisian grey.

A new generation of artisans has taken inspiration from the areaâ€™s African aesthetic

The textile skills that immigrants from Africa have brought to the Goutte dâ€™Or are part of the reason this web of around 20 small streets â€“ wedged between boulevard BarbÃ¨s, rue Stephenson, rue Ordener and boulevard de la Chapelle â€“ is now thriving as a creative hub, explains Christian Pechereau, coordinator of Les Gouttes Dâ€™Or de la Mode et du Design.

This association was set up eight years ago to support, develop and communicate about the skills of a new generation of artisans, many of whom have taken inspiration from the areaâ€™s African aesthetic â€“ and all of whom want to create something new, and attract new customers.

Helped by some public funding, it also aims to aid the transformation of a neighbourhood whose social and economic difficulties â€“ from high levels of unemployment to drug dealing and other street crime â€“ have led to an off-putting reputation for visitors.

Creative hub

â€œOur goal as an association is to pool our resources and communicate better about the skills and savoir-faire we have in the area, to bring it to a wider audience,â€ said Pechereau, speaking among the mannequins and patterned samples in the associationâ€™s showroom, on the cobbled rue des Gardes, where several new retail premises have helped attract creative businesses to the area, giving it a more welcoming vibe.

Design destinations are good as they give the public a snapshot of the local industry â€“ Trevyn McGowan

The Goutte dâ€™Or is by no means the only neighbourhood to have seen the potential in local creativity. In Finlandâ€™s capital, which was World Design Capital in 2012, Design District Helsinki has been helping local creative businesses across the design spectrum to work together and attract tourists and locals alike to witness their design talents since 2005. It now has 220 members. â€œHelsinki has a strong design heritage and is using design to improve city life,â€ said Piia Lehtinen, president of the board of Design District Helsinki. â€œWe support the cityâ€™s image as a design city.â€

And in Cape Town, South Africa, the area around the Southern Guild gallery run by design duo Trevyn and Julian McGowan is emerging as a design focal point in the recently renovated V&amp;A Waterfront area of the city.â€œWeâ€™re big believers in community and collaboration and a hub helps that,â€ said Trevyn McGowan. â€œDesign destinations are good as they give the public a snapshot of the local industry and create a design-savvy and design-proud public, which is essential for the development of the industry.â€

Back in Paris, the Goutte dâ€™Or association organises its own events and teams up with initiatives like Paris Design Week in order to attract visitors and to show what an often-overlooked part of Paris has to offer.

The association is thriving, with around 40 members benefitting from link-ups with museums, social media campaigns and open-workshop events, which are starting to get the message across.

It hasnâ€™t been easy, however. â€œItâ€™s starting to change â€“ some people want to go off the beaten track â€“ but often the people who pass by donâ€™t have the spending power to visit these boutiques,â€ said Pechereau.

â€œThe association aims to draw visitors here so they can see that our designers make objects that are original and much cheaper than elsewhere,â€ Pechereau added, giving the example of jewellery designer Dominique Petris who uses everything from razor-shell clams to leather, antique glass and paste paper in her designs, and has been based in the Goutte dâ€™Or for 17 years.

Her creations sell more easily in a boutique in the chic 8th arrondissement of Paris, than in her own workshop in the rue des Gardes, Pechereau says. Two years ago members of the association formed a textile cooperative, which has allowed them to win high-profile contracts including making historically accurate period clothes for museums and costumes for operas.

The cooperative began with three members, now has nine, and has more than doubled its turnover in two years. There are plans to open a shared workshop space in 2018 to allow it to accept bigger contracts and grow further.

Saloum Fadel, who runs Fadel Couture, a textile workshop in the heart of the Goutte dâ€™Or, also helps to manage the cooperative. Having successfully steered his own business towards high-end work such as making prototypes for designers including AgnÃ¨s B, to weather a widespread downturn in the textile industry, Fadel sees the importance of highlighting local savoir-faire in order to aid economic growth.

Local artisans are benefitting from a renewed appreciation of the skills the Goutte dâ€™Or has to offer, says Fadel, who is originally from Mauritania but has been in France for almost 28 years. â€œThereâ€™s now an undisputable value attached to the â€˜Made in Franceâ€™ label â€“ businesses that moved production to China and Eastern Europe are coming back because the quality wasnâ€™t there and customers are more and more conscious of the conditions their clothes are manufactured in.â€

Fadel agrees with Daigremont that cooperation among neighbours is a big plus for the neighbourhood. â€œThere are people here from so many different nationalities,â€ he said. â€œThereâ€™s a real sense of solidarity in the Goutte dâ€™Or. Thatâ€™s where the idea for the cooperative came from. Thereâ€™s a richness in reaching out to other people, sharing and giving something back.â€

3JVP4ZJHDQAS56FNS4F866DCKWK0IF,Why nothing seems to be stopping Trumpâ€™s trade war,"President Trump is remaking the global trade order without significant political resistance or penalty, unchecked by a largely compliant Congress and bolstered by the loyalty of his supporters â€” even those likely to be hurt by his burgeoning global trade war.

The Senate on Wednesday passed a nonbinding measure calling for a greater role in overseeing Trumpâ€™s trade decisions, an implicit criticism of new tariffs the president has levied on some of the countryâ€™s closest allies and largest trading partners. But the vote has no power to prompt a course change from the White House. And it follows failed attempts to advance measures that could have given Congress new power to restrain Trump.

Congressâ€™s passivity in the face of Trumpâ€™s escalating trade conflict is one of several factors that have made it easier for the president to push on. Others have included markets that havenâ€™t melted down, business leaders who have done little beyond using rhetoric to criticize the trade spat, and Republican voters who have stood by their president. In each of these cases, critics of his trade policy had hoped Trump would find reason to be dissuaded.

The trade changes mirror Trumpâ€™s rapid and similarly unchecked efforts to reposition the United States in the global political order. During his trip to Europe this week, the president has antagonized the countryâ€™s NATO allies. He also plans to meet next week with Russian President VladiÂ­mir Putin, seeking to tighten ties with a traditional rival.

On trade, U.S. partners have retaliated with their own tariffs on U.S. goods, targeting GOP strongholds and paining sensitive industries and areas that depend on access to foreign markets. New polling suggests, however, that Trump supporters in those areas are standing by the president.

The parts of the country most affected by Trumpâ€™s trade war remain supportive of the president for now. Among the 15 states most affected by the tariffs, Trumpâ€™s approval rating is 57 percent, according to a recent Washington Post-Schar School poll. Trump won 52 percent of the vote in those states in 2016.

Much of the pain has centered on soybean farmers, whose crops are exported widely and who have seen prices nosedive since the trade war intensified.

â€œI am in Brussels, but always thinking about our farmers,â€ Trump wrote Wednesday on Twitter. â€œI am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will win!â€

Trumpâ€™s unimpeded trade efforts could face more resistance, however, if disputes with allies intensify and more of their economic consequences hit home.

Though Trump has been making trade threats since the start of his presidential campaign, the opening rounds of tariffs are only now taking effect. If the U.S. economy were to slow meaningfully because of the conflict, Trump could yet be forced to change course.

But despite the escalating trade spats, markets have not cratered. While U.S. stocks slid Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 219 points, markets have kept relatively calm in recent weeks even as the United States and China swapped punitive trade measures.

Washington investment manager Michael Farr said that after months of presidential outbursts, Trump fatigue is setting in among investors.

â€œWall Street seems to be beginning to get him,â€ said Farr, who believes investors have largely priced in Trumpâ€™s trade actions and aggressive statements.

Senators looking to check Trumpâ€™s trade agenda saw hope for more action after Wednesdayâ€™s vote, when the Senate voted 88 to 11 to approve language asserting â€œa role for Congressâ€ when Trump imposes tariffs in the name of national security, as he has done with steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, Mexico, the European Union and others.

But one of the measureâ€™s strongest supporters, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), acknowledged after the vote that if the measure had had teeth, it wouldnâ€™t have passed.

â€œIf we had had a binding vote today, we wouldnâ€™t have won it,â€ Flake, who is retiring at the end of the congressional session, said Wednesday.

He added: â€œSome are still giving the president some kind of license or leash here. But most of us think we know where the president wants to go. And itâ€™s not where we want to be.â€

As the Senate suggests it should have more oversight, the administration has not paused in ramping up trade disputes.

Early this week Trump identified $200 billion in Chinese imports he would hit with tariffs unless Beijing agreed to major trade concessions. The massive levies would add to the $34 billion in Chinese imports on which Trump officially imposed new tariffs earlier this month â€” a move that drew an immediate dollar-for-dollar retaliation from China.

Tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports remain in place on most countries around the world, despite protests from Republican lawmakers and long-standing international allies.

Trumpâ€™s ability to unilaterally impose trade measures comes after Congress has repeatedly ceded its authority over trade through laws and fast-track agreements. That approach had worked well for congressional Republicans and other free-trade advocates, as presidents negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other pacts. Then Trump arrived determined to ride roughshod over all of it.

Many lawmakers from both parties believe Trump abused his authority in invoking Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allowed him to unilaterally impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports after his administration determined they posed a threat to U.S. security. Heâ€™s now threatening to do the same with automobiles, which lawmakers are warning could be even more ruinous to the economy.

Trumpâ€™s rejection of free trade is his most pronounced break from traditional Republican Party doctrine. But by most accounts, the president cannot be dissuaded from the protectionist views he formed decades ago and made a centerpiece of his campaign for president.

â€œHeâ€™s very true to what he said he was going to do during the campaign for president,â€ said Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.).

For months, Roberts and other Republicans have been sounding the alarm about retaliatory tariffs on farm country and elsewhere, and warning that a trade war threatens the strong economy that will be the GOPâ€™s calling card in the upcoming midterm elections, in which Democrats will aim to retake control of Congress.

A majority of Americans disapprove of Trumpâ€™s handling of trade and think escalating tariffs with China will be â€œbadâ€ for jobs, according to the Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted from June 27 to July 2. Thereâ€™s more worry about rising prices â€” nearly three-fourths of Americans believe tariffs will be bad for the cost of imported goods, according to the poll.

And even though Trumpâ€™s support in the 15 states most affected by the trade war remains high, a majority of respondents in those states also said they disapproved of the presidentâ€™s handling of international trade.

But when people are asked what their top issues are heading into the midterm elections, trade is low on the list, below issues such as the economy, jobs, health care, immigration, guns and taxes, according to the recent poll.

That may be in part because most Americans arenâ€™t feeling the impacts of these higher import taxes yet. The tariffs in place so far â€” and the retaliatory measures from other countries â€” will cost the average family about $80 more a year, according to economist Mark Zandi of Moodyâ€™s Analytics. Many large companies arenâ€™t even passing the additional costs on to consumers yet because they knew the tariffs were coming and planned ahead by buying supplies before the higher prices went into effect.

â€œThe impact is fairly negligible for most Americans right now,â€ said Chris Ellis, director of the Survey Research Laboratory at Bucknell University.

Phil Ramsey, chair of the Indiana Soybean Alliance membership and policy committee, said he speaks multiple times a day with other farmers in his state.

â€œMost of us farmers are extremely patient,â€ said Ramsey, a 58-year-old soybean and corn farmer who voted for Trump and attended his inauguration. â€œWe dump hundreds of thousands of seeds and fertilizer into these fields. Then we wait for them to grow. We know it will happen.â€

But lawmakers from farm states are cautioning Trump that he is testing votersâ€™ patience.

Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said trade was a constant theme in 10 county meetings last week in his home state.

â€œPeople are very nervous, and theyâ€™d like to have me say, â€˜Well, weâ€™re going have this settled by September the 15th or November the 15th.â€™ I canâ€™t give them that assurance,â€ Grassley said. â€œI can just tell them the presidentâ€™s negotiating approach is the longer you negotiate, the better deal you get. And so everybodyâ€™s nervous, and itâ€™s costing a lot.â€

He warned that â€œas time goes on, as prices go down, thereâ€™s less patienceâ€ from the voters for the president.

3FHTJGYT8OIHXWDCJ1UV0V14DIRGPF,Senate Dems Block Senate GOP Resolution to Support ICE,"Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) blocked a resolution on Wednesday to support the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.

Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) sponsored the S.Res. 572, a resolution to support the officers and personnel of ICE. Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), a co-sponsor of the resolution, attempted to have the Senate unanimously consider the resolution for a vote on Wednesday. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) blocked the consideration of Sen. Kennedyâ€™s resolution, contending that ICE has unfairly separated illegal immigrant children from their parents.

Merkley said:

This moment hardly seems the time for the Senate to engage in debating rhetorical phrases of praise for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. When that agency, better known as ICE is deeply mired in the scandal of separating children from their parents. it is ICE that partnered with border control and health and human services in this diabolical situation. itâ€™s Ice that holds the parents in detention camps.

The Oregon Democrat contended that the Senate should instead consider Sen. Kamala Harrisâ€™ (D-CA) bill, the REUNITE Act, which would prevent federal agencies from separating illegal alien children from their families and end mitigate President Donald Trumpâ€™s border enforcement policies.

The resolution states that the Senate:

(1) expresses continued support for all officers and employees of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (referred to in this resolution as â€œICEâ€) who carry out the important mission of ICE; (2) denounces calls for the complete abolishment of ICE; and (3) supports the efforts of officers and employees of the United States Armed Forces and Federal and State law enforcement agencies who bring law and order to the borders of the United States.

The House passed a resolution on Wednesday to support ICE and rebuke calls to abolish the customs agency.

Senators across the Republican spectrum supported the resolution; Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Ted Cruz (R-TX), David Perdue (R-GA), and even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) supported the resolution. Altogether 36 Republican senators supported the resolution.

Last week, Sen. Kennedy explained why he sponsored his resolution in support of ICE:

ICE officers are in the trenches fighting those threats and protecting American families from the cross-border crime and illegal immigration that endanger our families. ICE deserves our gratitude and respect, not scorn and ridicule.

Sen. Perdue said in a statement last week why he supports the resolution:

Every United States Senator should support this effort to recognize the brave women and men who wear the ICE uniform. ICE is a critical component of our countryâ€™s national security strategy created after the terrorist attacks on 9/11. Since then, our ICE law enforcement officers have dedicated their lives to arresting human traffickers, protecting communities from gangs, combating terrorism, and keeping drugs off the street. We donâ€™t say it enough â€“ thank you to all of our ICE officers.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said:

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency is an essential federal law enforcement agency. Without internal federal immigration law enforcement, illegal immigrants would be free to stay in our country forever once they snuck in the border or illegally overstayed their legally issued visa. We would no longer be a sovereign if we stopped governing who could and could not be in our country.

Meanwhile, President Trump tweeted that Democrats serve as a significant hurdle for ICE.

Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version incorrectly stated the number of ads aired from January to July by Democratic candidates and outside groups. The figure should be nearly 56,000.

WASHINGTON â€“ Senate Democratic candidates and allied outside groups have devoted more than 40 percent of their TV ads this year to health care â€“ spending a combined $17 million on spots pledging to protect people with pre-existing conditions, fight for lower drug prices and guard against cuts to Medicare.

The sharp focus on health care from Democrats stands in contrast to a more diffuse message on the GOP side. In hotly contested races across the country, Republicans and the GOP-leaning groups have divided their ad dollars on a broader set of issues â€“ spending about $10.5 million on spots embracing President Donald Trump, $14 million on ads touting the GOP tax law and $7.6 million on commercials highlighting a hard line on immigration.

The divergent ad strategies â€“ based on a USA TODAY analysis of data from Kantar Media â€“ offers a snapshot of Senate races as the primary season draws to a close and candidates pivot toward the general election only three months away.

From January through July, Democratic candidates and outside groups aired nearly 56,000 ads focused on health care, far and away the most common issue highlighted. The second-place star in Democratic spots was jobs and unemployment, featured in about 30,000 spots.

Republicans spent most of their paid TV time talking about Trump, if only by a sliver. GOP candidates and allied outside groups have aired 45,000 pro-Trump ads this year.

The GOPâ€™s signature legislative achievement â€“ the sweeping tax cut â€“ drew slightly fewer spots, at 43,000. More than half of those tax cut ads were paid for by Republican-leaning groups, as opposed to the candidates themselves.

Immigration and the roaring economy were essentially tied for third place among GOP spots, with 34,000 and 32,000 ads, respectively.

The figures highlight one advantage Senate Democrats have in an otherwise difficult election cycle. Ten incumbent Senate Democrats are up for re-election in states that Trump won in 2016, which gives Republicans a huge playing field for possible pickups.

But those Democratic incumbents have faced only nominal primary opponents, while Republican challengers in Indiana, Montana and elsewhere have spent months in bitter GOP nominating battles.

â€œDemocrats havenâ€™t had competitive primaries, so theyâ€™ve been focused on general-election messaging most of the cycle,â€ said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. â€œRepublicans have only been in general-election mode for about a month.""

Health care has surged as a top voter concern, and it could be as important a factor in the midterm elections as Trump, said Drew Altman, head of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.

â€œIâ€™ve always been cautious about hyping health care as a factor in elections,â€ Altman wrote for the website Axios. â€œBut if circumstances do not change, this is an election where health care may not only be a top issue, but also a critical factor in the vote.â€

Health care ranks as a higher priority for Democrats this year than it did for Republicans when they crusaded against the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and 2014. The issue is closely tied to Trump because of Republican efforts to undo the law either through legislation or executive action.

â€œI support the Affordable Care Act and voted against all of President Trumpâ€™s attempts to repeal it,â€ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., whose campaign has spent the most money on ads that mentions health care, boasts in an ad.

Rep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., who is trying to unseat Republican Sen. Dean Heller, is hitting him hard for voting to repeal Obamacare.

â€œHe decided not to cross Trump,â€ one ad says.

Even in states that Trump won easily, Democrats focus on health care. An ad by Montana Sen. Jon Tester features a cancer patient accusing Testerâ€™s GOP challenger, Matt Rosendale, of making health insurance less affordable in his role as the stateâ€™s insurance commissioner.

Voters listed pre-existing conditions as their top health care campaign issue in a Kaiser Family Foundation poll in June. Most Democratic and independent voters â€“ as well as about half of Republicans voters â€“ say a candidateâ€™s position on preserving protections for people with pre-existing conditions is either the â€œsingle most important factorâ€ or a â€œvery importantâ€ factor in their vote. Itâ€™s the top campaign issue for voters living in battleground areas such as Florida, according to the survey.

The Democratsâ€™ focus on health care â€œshows how the Republicans really blew it in 2017 by making health care their No. 1 legislative priority,â€ then failing to pass legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, said Steven Smith, a political science professor at Washington University.

â€œThe news from the Trump administration, with its cutting around on the edges of Obamacare through administrative action, has kept the issue alive and hasnâ€™t done Republican candidates any favors,â€ he said.

On the GOP side, the high volume of pro-Trump ads are striking because in midterm elections, candidates often try to run away from their partyâ€™s president. The Kantar data, as well as an analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project, found GOP candidates are doing the opposite: praising Trump at record rates.

â€œThe presidentâ€™s party tends to lose seats in midterm elections, and so typically candidates from the party tend to avoid tying themselves to the incumbent while opponent partisans typically go on the attack,â€ said Michael Franz, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. â€œIt is really striking that Republicans are overwhelmingly embracing Trump and very rarely criticizing him.â€

Democratic candidates and left-leaning outside groups have aired about 8,100 anti-Trump spots.

Democrats are navigating a difficult electoral map. In the 10 states where Trump won and Senate Democrats are up for-election, the president remains relatively popular, and Democrats cannot afford to alienate any potential crossover voters.

Some of these â€œred stateâ€ Democrats even mention Trump positively, such as Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and Joe Manchin in West Virginia.

â€œLook, Iâ€™m not running against Donald Trump,â€ Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen says in a TV spot his campaign launched in March. He promised in that spot to work with Trump on issues where they're in sync, though more recently he highlighted his opposition to Trump's tariffs.

Bredesen is a moderate and a popular former governor, running in a state Trump carried by 26 percentage points. It's no wonder he's circumspect in his criticism, said Smith, the Washington University professor.

""I think itâ€™s a question of treading carefully, picking your spots, criticizing the president where a policy is really unpopular in your constituency,â€ Smith said.

3M4KL7H8KW5CJB54MMAJN86HGLG16M,Former Trump administration officials: A list of notable departures,"A growing number of people have left the Trump administration in just over a year, including Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, chief strategist Steve Bannon and FBI Director James Comey.

Some, such as Comey, were fired by President Trump, while others resigned or retired for a variety of reasons.

Trump's administration has set records for turnover of senior officials, with more than 60 percent of those with the title of assistant to the president departing in the first 18 months.

The president addressed the high turnover in the White House in a March tweet, denying there is any ""chaos.""

""People will always come [and] go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection),"" he said.

Read on for a look at some of the staffers who have left since Trump took office.

Marc Short

March Short, who has served as Trump's director of legislative affairs, is leaving the White House for a position with the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.

Short's final day in the White House is July 20, and he is expected to join UVA's Miller Center in August, the school announced.

Economic aide Shahira Knight will take Short's place.

Scott Pruitt

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned after months of controversies, the president announced in a July 5 tweet.

""Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this,"" Trump said.

Pruitt resigned less than a week after The New York Times reported that the EPA's chief ethics official, Kevin Minoli, had been pushing for a series of independent investigation into several aspects of Pruitt's tenure.

Pruitt and his office, which he led since 2017, had come under fire for extravagant spending habits, including on first-class travel, pay raises to top aides and a $43,000 soundproof booth.

Thomas Homan

Thomas Homan, the acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, retired from federal service after 34 years in June.

While leading ICE, Homan spearheaded a 40 percent surge in deportation arrests and established policies to make immigration arrests at courthouses and detain pregnant women. He has been one of the administrationâ€™s most outspoken and enthusiastic advocates of its crackdown on illegal immigration, and was the presidentâ€™s pick to officially lead the department.

An ICE official told Fox News that Homan originally planned to retire in January 2017 but decided to stay on when he was asked by John Kelly, then the Department of Homeland Security secretary.

Citing family considerations, Homan informed DHS leadership early this year that he planned to retire this summer and was asked by the secretary to remain in his position in the interim to assist with transition planning.

Trump elevated Homan to acting ICE director in January 2017, replacing Daniel Ragsdale.

Nadia Schadlow

Dr. Nadia Schadlow, the deputy national security adviser for strategy, offered her letter of resignation, effective April 27, according to a copy provided to Fox News.

Schadlow led the drafting of the Trump administration's ""America First"" National Security Strategy, released in December 2017. She was hired by H.R. McMaster, who left his post as national security adviser in March.

Tom Bossert

Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert resigned on April 10, according to the White House.

â€œThe President is grateful for Tomâ€™s commitment to the safety and security of our great country,â€ White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

Sanders added that Bossert led the administrationâ€™s efforts â€œto protect the homeland from terrorist threats, strengthen our cyber defenses and respond to an unprecedented series of natural disasters.â€

Bossertâ€™s exit came a day after John Bolton took over as the new national security adviser.

David Shulkin

Trump fired Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin on March 28. The president said he was â€œthankfulâ€ for Shulkinâ€™s â€œservice to our countryâ€ and veterans in a tweet.

Robert Wilkie, the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, will serve as the interim secretary until he is confirmed by the Senate.

After his firing, Shulkin penned a blistering op-ed for The New York Times in which he blasted the â€œtoxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversiveâ€ environment of Washington, D.C.

â€œI have been falsely accused of things by people who wanted me out of the way,â€ Shulkin said. â€œBut despite these politically-based attacks on me and my familyâ€™s character, I am proud of my record and know that I acted with the utmost integrity. Unfortunately, none of that mattered.â€

Shulkin had come under fire after his then-chief of staff had doctored emails to justify his wife traveling to Europe with him at taxpayer expense. He was also criticized for improperly accepting Wimbledon tickets. He had agreed to pay back the government more than $4,000.

H.R. McMaster

Trump announced March 22 that National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster will be replaced on April 9 by former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, who is a Fox News contributor.

""I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job &amp; will always remain my friend,"" the president tweeted.

McMaster said in a statement, ""After thirty-four years of service to our nation, I am requesting retirement from the U.S. Army effective this summer after which I will leave public service. Throughout my career it has been my greatest privilege to serve alongside extraordinary servicemembers and dedicated civilians.""

He added that he is ""thankful to President Donald J. Trump for the opportunity to serve him and our nation as national security advisor.""

The announcement comes after months of speculation over whether McMaster would resign or be fired from his post.

A White House official said March 22 that the president and McMaster â€œmutually agreedâ€ that he would resign from his post. The two have been discussing this for some time, the official said, noting that the timeline was expedited as they both felt it was important to have a new team in place, instead of constant speculation.

A White House official said the decision was not related to any one moment or incident, but rather the result of ongoing conversations between the two.

Andrew McCabe

Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on March 16 â€“ just days before he was set to retire, jeopardizing his pension.

The dismissal was made on the recommendation of FBI disciplinary officials. A yet-to-be-released inspector general report allegedly concluded McCabe had authorized the release of information to the media and had not been forthcoming with the watchdog office as it examined the bureau's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

""The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability,"" Sessions said in a statement after McCabe was fired.

In a tweet, Trump said the firing marked a â€œgreat day for the hard working men and women of the FBI.â€

The dismissal came after McCabe, a 20-year veteran of the FBI, was ""removed"" from his position as the No. 2 figure at the FBI and went on ""terminal leave"" in January, a source told Fox News at the time.

He had repeatedly been criticized by Trump since 2016 when it was revealed that his wife, Dr. Jill McCabe, had accepted campaign contributions from the political action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a close Clinton ally, during a failed state Senate run.

Rex Tillerson

Trump announced on March 13 that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would be replaced by CIA Director Mike Pompeo.

Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil chief, served as the nationâ€™s top diplomat since February 2017. Rumors of his departure had circulated for months, especially after he reportedly called Trump a â€œmoronâ€ in front of other Cabinet officials in July 2017.

In a tweet, Trump thanked Tillerson for his service to the country. A senior White House official told Fox News that Trump made the decision to replace Tillerson ahead of a planned meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.

Tillerson later told reporters that he delegated his responsibilities to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan until his final day at the end of March.

John McEntee

Trump's longtime personal aide John McEntee, 27, was escorted from the White House on March 13. McEntee, who was reportedly well-liked in the West Wing, occupied a key White House role, never far from Trump in the White House or on the road.

He was moved to Trump's 2020 campaign, where he will serve as a senior adviser for campaign operations, the Trump campaign said.

Gary Cohn

The removal of Gary Cohn from his post as National Economic Council director was confirmed by Fox News on March 6.

""Gary has been my chief economic advisor and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again,"" Trump said in a statement. ""He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.â€

Cohn, who served as Trumpâ€™s chief economic adviser since the beginning of the administration, had reportedly been discussing with the president his transition out of the White House for several weeks. Cohn opposed Trump's planned tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum and tried to get the president to change course.

Cohn drafted a resignation letter last year, following the president's response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va.

Roberta Jacobson

Roberta Jacobson, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, said in a March 1 note that she would be resigning from her post in the spring.

Her resignation, which she said would take effect on May 5, comes amid strained relations between the two countries. She did not specify why she will be leaving her post but said on Twitter that she is â€œin search of other opportunities.â€

""I have come to the difficult decision that it is the right time to move on to new challenges and adventures,"" Jacobson wrote in her note. ""This decision is all the more difficult because of my profound belief in the importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship and knowledge that it is at a crucial moment.""

A career diplomat, Jacobson previously served as assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs and is seen as having a deep understanding of the region and the Mexico-U.S. relationship. She said she has spent more than 31 years in government service.

Hope Hicks

White House communications director Hope Hicks resigned, Fox News confirmed on Feb. 28.

Hicks was one of Trumpâ€™s longest serving aides, as she previously worked for him and his family before he announced his candidacy. Her last full day at the White House was March 28.

â€œHope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years,â€ Trump said in a statement.

â€œThere are no words to adequately express my gratitude to President Trump,â€ Hicks, a former Ralph Lauren fashion model, said in a statement. â€œI wish the president and his administration the very best as he continues to lead our country.â€

The announcement came a day after Hicks acknowledged to a House intelligence panel that she occasionally told ""white lies"" for Trump but denied lying about anything relevant to the Russia investigation.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Hicks' decision to leave the administration was â€œsomething that sheâ€™s been thinking about for a while.â€

Hicks, who largely worked behind the scenes during her tenure with Trump, found herself in the spotlight earlier this year when her relationship with former White House staff secretary Rob Porter was revealed. Porter left his job earlier in February after allegations surfaced that he physically abused his two ex-wives.

Josh Raffel

Josh Raffel, a top White House communications aide who served as a spokesman for Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, will leave the administration sometime in the coming months.

Raffel joined the administration in the spring of 2017. He was hired to work on communications for the White House Office of American Innovation and also worked on behalf of Kushner and Trump. His portfolio of issues included tax reform and the Middle East peace process.

In a statement, Ivanka Trump called Raffel ""honest, passionate and thoughtful,"" adding that his ""guidance was invaluable.""

Raffel is expected to return to New York to join the private sector and tend to family obligations, Axios reported.

David Sorensen

White House speechwriter David Sorensen resigned on Feb. 9 amid domestic abuse allegations.

Sorensen's ex-wife first told The Washington Post that he was violent and emotionally abusive during their marriage. He has denied the allegations.

Sorensen's position did not require a security clearance, the White House said, adding that his background check was ongoing.



Sorensen had worked as a senior adviser to Gov. Paul LePage, according to the Portland Press Herald.

Rachel Brand

Rachel Brand stepped down from her position, Fox News confirmed on Feb. 9. Brand was an associate attorney general in the Department of Justice.

Brand, the No. 3 official in the Justice Department, served in the role for nine months before accepting a job with Walmart. She will serve as the retail giant's executive vice president, global governance and corporate secretary.

In an interview with Fox News, Brand disputed claims that she left the administration due to Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign.

Rob Porter

White House staff secretary Rob Porter announced his resignation from the Trump administration on Feb. 7 following reports that he abused his two ex-wives.

Porterâ€™s ex-wives told the Daily Mail that he was physically and mentally abusive.

Porter denied the â€œoutrageous allegations"" and resigned from his position.

â€œI have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign,â€ Porter said.

Two days after the resignation, Trump wished the former staffer well, saying he hopes Porter has ""a great career ahead of him."" He said the allegations were ""very sad"" and stressed that Porter has maintained his innocence.

Omarosa Manigault Newman

A former â€œApprenticeâ€ star, Omarosa Manigault Newman joined the Trump administration as the director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison to work on outreach to various contingency groups.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Dec. 13 that Manigault Newmanâ€™s last day with the White House would be Jan. 20 â€“ exactly one year since Trumpâ€™s inauguration.

Manigault Newman reportedly drew scrutiny from White House chief of staff John Kelly. She also came under fire for bringing her 39-person bridal party to the White House for a photo shoot in 2017.

Richard Cordray

Richard Cordray resigned from his post as the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Nov. 24, 2017, setting off a fight between his former chief of staff and the White House over who would replace him.

Cordrayâ€™s resignation didnâ€™t come as a surprise; he had previously said he would quit his job by the end of November. But many thought his resignation would set up Trump to appoint his own director of an agency that has been widely criticized by his administration and Republicans alike.

However, before his resignation, Cordray elevated his chief of staff Leandra English to the deputy director position â€“ meaning she would become acting CFPB director after he quit. But the White House announced Mick Mulvaney, head of the Office of Management and Budget, as its interim director.

Tom Price

Tom Price officially resigned from his post as Health and Human Services Secretary on Sept. 29, 2017, according to a White House statement.

The move came after Price received major criticism following reports of his use of private planes.

Price had promised to repay the government for the use of his costly flights and vowed never to take a private charter plane again while in his post as secretary but was ultimately let go anyway.

Sebastian Gorka

The White House announced that Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to Trump, was no longer a part of the administration during a Friday evening news dump on Aug. 25, 2017.

White House officials told Fox News that Gorka did not resign but confirmed that he â€œno longer worksâ€ with the administration.

However, Gorka insisted to the Washington Examiner that he did actually resign.

A former Breitbart news editor, Gorka joined the Trump administration as a counterterrorism adviser and assisted with national security policy decisions alongside Bannon, according to White House sources.

Steve Bannon

Steve Bannon was removed from his position as White House chief strategist on Aug. 18, 2017.

The Breitbart News chief joined Trump's presidential campaign and was later appointed to a senior adviser role after Trump won the election.

Bannon, the hardcore populist, had become increasingly isolated inside the White House following John Kelly's appointment as chief of staff, White House sources and outside advisers told Fox News.

A White House aide told Fox News that Bannonâ€™s ouster wasnâ€™t sudden; he submitted his resignation in writing several weeks prior, the aide said.

Anthony Scaramucci

The announcement of Anthony Scaramucci as the White House communications director on July 21, 2017, set into motion a big shakeup in White House staff.

But Scaramucci himself lasted only 10 days in the White House. He was reportedly removed at the request of new White House chief of staff John Kelly.

Kelly was sworn in as chief of staff just hours before Scaramucci was removed.

Reince Priebus

Trump announced Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly as his new White House chief of staff on July 28, 2017, effectively ousting Reince Priebus.

The replacement of Preibus as chief of staff came amid tensions between he and Scaramucci, the White House communications director at the time.

Michael Short

White House assistant press secretary Michael Short resigned on July 25, 2017, after Scaramucci informed Politico of his intent to fire him.

â€œThis is the problem with the leaking,â€ Scaramucci reportedly told reporters. â€œThis is actually a terrible thing. Letâ€™s say Iâ€™m firing Michael Short today. The fact that you guys know about it before he does really upsets me as a human being and as a Roman Catholic.â€

Sean Spicer

After the hiring of Anthony Scaramucci, White House press secretary Sean Spicer announced his resignation on July 21, 2017.

Walter Shaub

Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub Jr. announced on July 6, 2017 that he was resigning from his job after clashing with Trump. His final date in office was July 19.

In his position, Shaub was often at odds with the Trump administration, particularly when it came to Trumpâ€™s business dealings.

Shaub joined the Campaign Legal Center, an organization in Washington that mostly focuses on violations of campaign finance law.

Michael Dubke

While former White House communications director Michael Dubke tendered his resignation quietly on May 18, 2017, he stayed on with the administration until after the presidentâ€™s first foreign trip.

He said that he resigned due to â€œpersonalâ€ reasons.

James Comey

Trump abruptly fired former FBI Director James Comey in a brief letter on May 9, 2017, saying Comey could not â€œeffectively leadâ€ the bureau any longer.

Trump repeatedly criticized Comeyâ€™s handling of the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clintonâ€™s personal email server, and Comey said after his firing that he felt uncomfortable by comments Trump made about the FBIâ€™s investigation into Michael Flynn.

Comey reportedly was speaking to employees in Los Angeles when news of his ousting came across the television. At the time, according to reports, Comey thought it was a prank.

Katie Walsh

Deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh resigned on March 30, 2017, after a Trump-backed health care bill failed to make it through the House, according to The Associated Press.

She left the White House to join the pro-Trump nonprofit America First Policies.

Walsh came to the White House after serving in the Republican National Committee under then-chairman Reince Priebus.

Preet Bharara

Manhattan federal prosecutor Preet Bharara was fired on March 11, 2017, after he declined to willingly resign from his job.

The Justice Department said attorneys general who were holdovers from the Obama administration needed to resign. Bharara refused to do so.

â€œI did not resign. Moments ago I was fired,â€ Bharara tweeted. â€œBeing the US Attorney in [the Southern District of New York] will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life.â€

Michael Flynn

Michael Flynn, Trumpâ€™s embattled national security adviser, resigned on Feb. 13, 2017, after it was revealed that he apparently lied about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador.

â€œI have nothing to be ashamed for and everything to be proud of,â€ Flynn told Fox News at the time.

Sally Yates

Taking over as acting attorney general following the departure of Loretta Lynch, Sally Yates was removed from her position on January 30, 2017.

Yates refused to enforce Trumpâ€™s controversial travel ban and issued a memo to the Justice Department not to defend the executive order.

39WSF6KUV331SI5KY6RSBSB2QXGOEP,Rep. Joe Crowley defeated in Democratic primary upset by newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,"Rep. Joe Crowley, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus who was thought by some to be a future Speaker of the House, suffered a shocking primary defeat in New York's 14th House District Tuesday.

With 88 percent of precincts reporting, 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- who has never held elected office -- led Crowley by more than 3,600 votes.

Ocasio-Cortez, a Bernie Sanders supporter who has called for the abolition of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), had gained the endorsement of several left-wing groups, including MoveOn and the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).

""We have built power. We have organized,"" Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter as the polls closed. ""What we have built is permanent. No. Matter. What.""

Soon after The Associated Press called the race, the New York City branch of the DSA tweeted congratulations to Ocasio-Cortez, saying that her victory proved ""that working class people are hungry for a voice in politics.""

In a statement, Crowley congratulated Ocasio-Cortez on her victory and said he looked forward to supporting her against Republican Anthony Pappas in November.

""The Trump administration is a threat to everything we stand for here in Queens and the Bronx, and if we don't win back the House this November, we will lose the nation we love,"" Crowley said. ""This is why we must come together. We will only be able to stop Donald Trump and the Republican Congress by working together, as a united Democratic Party.""

The National Republican Campaign Committee celebrated the defeat of ""poor Joe Crowley.""

""House Democrats, hoping for a post-Pelsoi era, are now left leaderless,"" NRCC spokesman Matt Gorman said. ""The only person happier tonight than Nancy Pelosi is the NRCC.""

President Trump also reveled in the downfall of the man he called ""Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley""

""That is a big one that nobody saw happening,"" Trump said of Crowley's defeat. ""Perhaps he should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his President!""

Crowley, the fourth-ranked House Democrat and a ten-term incumbent, was viewed by many observers as the one person a broad enough support base to potentially succeed House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi or House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer. His defeat leaves a large gap in the House Democratic leadership and ensures that Pelosi and Hoyer will be able to remain in their posts, if they choose to do so.

In a statement, Pelosi described Crowley as ""an unwavering champion for Americaâ€™s working families for almost two decades"" who ""brought principled, unifying and forward-looking leadership to the historic challenges of the Trump Administration"" as the Democratic caucus chair.

""I salute Chairman Crowley for a formidable legacy of achievement for the people of New York,"" Pelosi concluded. ""I congratulate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on her victory.""

3LN50BUKPWTXJORDUSRBDN6C9ZDLPQ,Donald Trump claims victory in Nato spending row amid reports he threatened to pull US out of alliance,"Donald Trump has said that the United States' commitment to Nato ""remains very strong"", after he claimed member countries agreed to his demands to increase funding for defence.

Mr Trump refused to deny that he had threatened to pull the US out of the organisation, and said the atmosphere in the meeting was ""a little tough for a little while,"" but cordial after the spending commitments went up ""like a rocket ship"".

The US president has railed repeatedly about Nato members failing to meet the agreed spending commitment of two per cent of GDP on defence. On Thursday morning he claimed victory, saying that nations had finally agreed to up their expenditure.

""Everyone in the room thanked me,"" he said. ""There is a great collegial atmosphere in that room, that I don't think they've had for many years.""

Asked directly whether he had threatened to withdraw, he replied: ""I told people I'd be very unhappy if they didn't up their commitment. Yesterday I let them know I was extremely unhappy.""

Mr Trump's claims of victory were tempered by Emmanuel Macron, the French president, who denied that Nato allies agreed to boost defence spending, referring to an existing communique setting out a goal of all members reaching two per cent of GDP spending by 2024.

Mr Macron also poured cold water on the suggestion Mr Trump had threatened to pull out of Nato if he didn't get the commitments he wanted. ""President Trump never at any moment, either in public or in private, threatened to withdraw from NATO,"" Mr Macron told reporters.

Mr Trump claimed his emphatic victory in an extensive and freewheeling press conference that followed what appeared to be a fraught morning of negotiations.

He said that Jens Stolenberg, the Nato secretary-general, credited him for changing the dynamic in the organisation, and increasing funding.

Nato defence expenditure and major annual exercises involving US troops

""Nato is much stronger than it was two days ago,"" Mr Trump declared.

""We had a fantastic meeting at the end. Germany has increased very substantially what it is doing. I brought it up, no one brought it up but me.

""And frankly maybe everyone is going to have a good relationship with Russia.""

Responding to questions about his meeting with Vladimir Putin, scheduled for Monday in Helsinki, Mr Trump said: ""He's a competitor. He's representing Russia. I'm representing America. It's not a question of a friend or enemy.""

He said he ""hoped to be able to get along"" with the Russian leader.

Reports of Mr Trump's threats to Nato members surfaced on Friday morning as it emerged Nato leaders, gathered in Brussels, held an unplanned emergency meeting.

Mr Trump repeated demands on the second day of the summit for countries to meet a spending target of two percent of GDP now, instead of by 2024, and to eventually double spending to four per cent.

Mr Trump's demands prompted leaders to huddle in a special session excluding other summit participants, sources told Reuters.

At one point, in a break with diplomatic protocol, a source said Mr Trump addressed German Chancellor Angela Merkel by her first name and told her: ""Angela, you need to do something about this.""

Invited leaders from non-Nato countries Afghanistan and Georgia were asked to leave along with most Nato leaders' retinues of officials, as the heads of state and government of the Western alliance sought to deal with the man whose nation commands much of the budget and forces for Europe's defence.

Nato | Did Trump threaten to pull out?

Mr Trump had opened the first day of talks in Brussels on Wednesday with a public diatribe against Germany, the second biggest state in the Western defence alliance, before the mood appeared to have calmed as the summit went into its second day, focusing on operations beyond Europe.

But, several sources said, Mr Trump instead reopened in strong terms his demand that other countries greatly speed up their progress toward a Nato target of spending at least two percent of their GDP on defence, which now has a deadline of 2024 with get-out terms available that can stretch it to 2030.

""The language was much tougher today,"" one source told Reuters. ""His harshest words were directed at Germany, including by calling her Angela --'You, Angela.'""

As well as Ms Merkel, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Charles Michel, the prime minister of Belgium, were also singled out by Mr Trump for undershooting on their spending targets when US taxpayers, funding a defence budget worth about 3.6 per cent of their national income, foot much of Nato's bills.

Breaking from a carefully scripted session that was to focus on Ukraine and Georgia, one source said Mr Trump ""forcibly restated his position on wanting Nato members to reach 2 percent spending target to a short a deadline"".

Donald Trump's UK visit | Read more

Mr Trump singled out Mrs Merkel a day after saying Berlin had become a ""captive of Russia"" because of a gas pipeline deal and should be paying more for defence.

Mr Stoltenberg told a news conference following the summit: ""We had a very frank and open discussion... That discussion has made NATO stronger. It has created a new sense of urgency.

""The fact that we had this open discussion has also clearly stated that we will redouble our efforts and it also shows that a clear message from President Trump is having an impact.""

On Thursday afternoon Mr Trump landed in the UK, and brushed off the threat of protests.

""I think it's fine,"" he said. ""I think they like me a lot in the UK. I think they agree with me on immigration.""

He said that immigration was ""taking over Europe"".

Asked whether he supported a hard Brexit, he laughed and said he thought the reporter asked if he was ""heartbroken"".

The US president appeared not to be aware of the term ""hard Brexit"", and said it was a decision for the British people, who had voted for Brexit.

""You use a term hard Brexit - I assume that's what you mean,"" he said.

""I just want the people to be happy. They are great people. I assume there will be protests - there are always protests.""

The US president is due to meet Mr Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday.

Mr Trump told reporters after the Nato summit that he will raise election meddling and arms control when he meets the Russian president.

Mr Trump also said he was ""not happy about Crimea"", although he once again failed to rule out recognising Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian region.

The US president described the up-coming summit with Mr Putin as a ""loose meeting"" and said ""we'll see where it leads,"" adding: ""I think meeting with people is great.""",https://www.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-claims-victory-nato-105203527.html,"['Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Republican', 'Neutral', 'Republican']","['2', '2', '2', '2', '5']"
3UY4PIS8QS3KQWBWL3W0PJS3B9K1N7,Fear of ICE stops rural immigrants from reporting crime,"CLOSE An immigrant couple who was detained by immigration authorities after attempting to visit their daughter at a military base has been released from custody to their home in Brooklyn. The couple spoke to reporters Thursday about their ordeal. (July 26) AP

As crime rises outside nation's cities and suburbs, the threat of ICE keeps immigrant communities from reporting it.

Rural Americans who overwhelmingly voted for President Donald Trump apparently thought they were dealing a blow to a government they believed had forgotten them.

What they did, though, in the midst of a violent crime spike in rural America, was deal a kneecap to themselves. How?

They voted for a president whose unleashing of Immigration and Customs Enforcement could be silencing an immigrant community that would otherwise report crime, and help drive out an element that's putting rural America in danger.

The 911 call that nearly got him deported

Take the case of Wilson Rodriguez Macarreno.

Six months ago, the father of three in Tukwila, Washington, dialed 911 on a trespasser after a series of break-in attempts. Barely an hour later, he was swept up by ICE officials and faced deportation to Honduras.

The case garnered national attention. Heâ€™s now back with his family in Washington, said Matt Adams of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, which is handling his case as well as a civil suit Macarreno brought against officials.

As for whether Macarreno still feels comfortable calling the police, Adams said, â€œI sincerely doubt it.â€

Tukwila is in suburban Washington, but Macarrenoâ€™s rural counterparts are no more enthusiastic about calling cops when ICE could potentially get involved.

And with spikes in rural crime, communities need as many folks to remain who care about keeping neighborhoods safe as they can get.

Rural crime rates on the rise

For the first time in a decade, the violent crime rate in rural America rose above the national average. That rise, The Wall Street Journal reported in May, was buoyed by the heroin and opioid epidemic inundating rural communities.

But also rising in those communities is the immigrant population, who could provide much needed assistance in fighting that crime wave if Trumpâ€™s crackdown had not put roadblocks in place that have the potential to drive those immigrants underground.

Last year, Tom K. Wong, a professor of political science at the University of California-San Diego, analyzed FBI crime data and found that crime rates were lower in sanctuary cities and counties than in non-sanctuary areas.

The Marshall Project made a similar finding in its analysis of the data.

Wongâ€™s analysis included rural sanctuary areas, which had more than 1,000 crimes per 100,000 people, versus nearly 2,000 crimes per 100,000 people in non-sanctuary rural areas.

He also conducted a survey of undocumented Mexican nationals in San Diego County, 76 percent of which is considered rural. It revealed, among other things, that only 3.4 percent of them would back away from reporting a crime if the cops were not working with ICE. Compare that with the 64.2 percent who stated they would be less likely to report crimes if law enforcement was working with ICE.

Since 1990 more immigrants â€” largely from Mexico and Central America â€” have been settling into the rural environs of the Midwest and Southeast.

In fact, a 2018 Pew Research Center analysis found that were it not for 600,000 immigrants moving into the nationâ€™s rural counties between 2000 and 2014, those counties, which continue to bleed their native-born populations, would have lost 950,000 residents.

A 2016 study in the Journal of Ethnicity in Criminal Justice notes that immigrants in most communities also bring a propensity to strengthen social institutions that leads to drops in crime.

As deportation fears force Latinos into silence, rural communities grappling with opioid and heroin crimes spikes wonâ€™t only be poorer and sicker for it. Theyâ€™ll be more dangerous, too.

3FO95NVK5DI5ZE2IRTS1U4KM26LRS4,A Bridge Over Trumped Troubled Waters,"Wisdom is how Heroes Defeat Tweets of Misinformation

Iâ€™m not into obits that spare the rod at the cost of truth. Senator John McCain could be petty and rage in a fit of temper, but while lesser men, had other priorities or claimed bone spurs for deferments, John McCain â€“ who wasnâ€™t a war hero for being captured â€“ but a true patriotic example for all who aspire to live heroic lives â€“ serving and staying in Vietnam until his fellow POWs were released. Then, returning home, he was a, serving America hero, throughout his life.

As husband, father, Navy Fighter Pilot and Politician, John McCain, a frequent ally on both sides of the aisle, optimized, whether thumbs up or down, all of our States were his responsibility â€“ even when Americans failed to follow his example to preserve, protect and defend every life on American soil.

McCain knew from Alaskaâ€™s front porch view of Russia, to hurricane hammered Hawaii, to forgotten Native Americans and geographically detached Puerto Rican Americans â€“ true patriots, like real heroes, donâ€™t use ICE to destroy families and disappear children.

During his eighty-one years:

President Lyndon B. Johnson unnecessarily made Eisenhowerâ€™s and Kennedyâ€™s Vietnam worse

With Kent State, failure to keep Vietnam promise and Watergate cover-up, President Richard M. Nixon devastated Americaâ€™s faith in government

In 1968, America lost Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Then Bobby. Then in the streets of Chicago, a defensive Mayor Richard J. Daley released offensive police to commit assault and battery against anti-war American citizens â€“ violence which, in the heat of three nights, lured America onto the road to Trumpâ€™s erosion of our First Amendment.

Only a united people can survive the uber wealthy Republican 50-year plan to herd us, no matter our political POV, into feudalistic surfs over consuming for Corporatismâ€™s profit.

Our current wounds and troubled waters didnâ€™t start with Trumpâ€™s flood of lies, though his lack of knowledge and respect for American law, coupled with a complete disregard for human decency, probably convinces his morally destitute ego that he alone is master of our un-Americanism.

Nonetheless, Americaâ€™s current troubling waves are less about Trump and more about how Americans progress our nation forward embodying our ideals of life, liberty and the pursuit of justice for all, finally internalizing:

Immigration Reform means practicing what our Statue of Liberty preaches

Children must be saved from gun violence and all pedophiles whether priests or preachers, politicians or teachers, college coaches or athletic doctors

Justice for All means ALL - including LGBTQ, those taking a knee and refugees seeking asylum

However, as long as some Americans vote for a Supreme Court that betrays our historical Separation of Church and State, our desire for gender equality and our, one person, one vote Exceptionalism â€“ America will be trumped by greed twisting Constitutional interpretations into profit margins.

When Americans choose to ignore Emoluments Clause violations, limitations of the 25th Amendment â€“ laughing off live confessions of grabbing intimate female areas, unpresidential disrespect for heroes like John McCain, while inflaming division with Tweets of misinformation â€“ America will be run by a cowardly Congress, politized SCOTUS and an unindicted co-conspirator POTUS, increasingly cornered - and dangerously vengeful.

The loss of anyone is as heartbreaking for family and friends, as losing the vision, humor and soul of a nation, is crippling. Nonetheless we need rediscover our hero within to non-violently vanquish the opportunists inciting a house divided against itself.

Americansâ€™ faith in our collective heroism, individual integrity and personal strength of character has been relentlessly attacked by tsunamis of hateful self-delusion, fearful self-doubt and ravenous death: Anthony Bourdain, Steve Ditko, Milos Forman, Stephen Hawking, Tab Hunter, Margot Kidder, Robin Leach, Philip Roth, Kate Spade, Tom Wolfe, Craig Zadan â€“ and now Aretha Franklin, Neil Simon and John McCain.

In nineteen months, Trump confirmed it is easier to destroy Americaâ€™s protective institutions than it is for a Christ-like Pope to save a Roman institution from itself.

Throughout his life, Senator John McCain made it abundantly clear, he served an America that was for all of its people â€“ including rivals.

3R15W654VEBIJ0SSU560DSWMEVZLQH,"Abbreviated Pundit Round-up: Trump is doomed, Trump isn't doomed, and saying farewell to John McCain","Max Boot should take off that stupid hat for this one.

Working on McCainâ€™s 2008 campaign as a foreign policy adviser was the easiest job I ever had, because McCain knew as much about foreign policy as anyone in Washington. He traveled incessantly to tend to Americaâ€™s alliances. He was unshakeable in his conviction that Americaâ€™s mission was to champion democracy and oppose despotism. Every U.S. president since the rise of Vladimir Putin in 1999 has engaged in naive reverie about working with the Russian strongman. McCain never had any such illusions. As he later said, â€œI looked in Mr. Putinâ€™s eyes and I saw three lettersâ€”a K, a G and B.â€

And then Boot goes on to discuss how Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama should have voted for more war. Because you shouldnâ€™t miss an opportunity.

The Washington Post on an American.

In late July 1967, he was in the cockpit of his A-4 Skyhawk fighter jet on the deck of the USS Forrestal when a rocket was accidentally launched across the deck, wreaking havoc on the ship. Mr. McCain, then a lieutenant commander, escaped the inferno, his flight suit in flames. One hundred and thirty-four lives were lost in the explosion and fire. â€œAfter a short while,â€ he wrote in an affecting passage in his memoir, â€œI went to sick bay to have my burns and shrapnel wounds treated. There I found a horrible scene of many men burned beyond saving, grasping the last moments of life. . . . Someone called my name, a kid, anonymous to me because the fire had burned off all his identifying features. He asked me if a pilot in our squadron was okay. I replied that he was. The young man said, â€˜Thank God,â€™ and died. I left the sick bay unable to keep my composure. . . . Men sacrificed their lives for one another and for their ship. Many of them were only eighteen and nineteen years old.â€

McCain was, quite simply, the last Republican. Itâ€™s quite possible for someone to disagree on political points, even on points that seem both obvious and vital, and yet not be a bad person. And maybe the best thing about John McCain was that he knew that.

One last time â€¦

There are people still in Washington who use the Republican title, but long ago gave up any pretense of being the party of Lincoln. When it comes time to put the pieces back together, they could do a lot worse than becoming the party of McCain.

The â€˜Iâ€™ Word

Jill Abramson on the only cure for Trump.

The walls have suddenly caved in on Donald Trumpâ€™s presidency. First came Michael Cohenâ€™s stunning plea agreement, in which Trumpâ€™s longtime fixer and trusted legal gun admitted in a federal courtroom in Manhattan that he had committed crimes at the direction of the president. Then, in Alexandria, Virginia, Robert Muellerâ€™s prosecution team notched a big win with the guilty verdict on eight counts reached by the jury against Paul Manafort, Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager. â€¦ A third wall crumbled over the weekend, when the New York Times revealed that the White House counsel, Don McGahn, had spent 30 hours providing information to Mueller. On Sunday, the president himself invoked Watergate in one of his fevered tweets. Referring to the man whose testimony led directly to the vote to impeach Richard Nixon, Trump tweeted that McGahn was no â€œJohn Dean type â€˜RATâ€™â€ in a panicked effort to dispute and discredit the Times story.

And that was before word got out that Allen Weisselberg, CFO of the Trump Organization, had been given immunity in exchange for his testimony. Trump is right. He is being â€œAl Caponâ€™d.â€ In the sense that Capone was guilty.

The past week could go down in history as being just as consequential as the crucial period in the spring and early summer of 1973, when everything caved in on Nixon. It was then that Dean began cooperating with the Senate Watergate committee and Nixon was forced to fire his closest aides, John Erlichman and Bob Haldeman, the architects of the criminal Watergate cover-up. It was downhill from there until Nixonâ€™s resignation on 9 August, 1974.

Itâ€™s just a damn shame that John McCain canâ€™t be the one who walks up the hill to tell Trump itâ€™s time for him to leave. But hey, maybe Barack Obama can stand in. Trump would love that.

Richard Wolffe is ready to see Trumpâ€™s sizable posterior getting smaller in the distance.

To lose one of your inner circle to criminal charges may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose two on the same day looks like carelessness. Donald Trump is nothing if not careless. His type inevitably gets like that as their escapades grow ever more preposterous. Sooner or later, their delusional sense of power and smarts ends in the kind of concrete solitude now being contemplated by Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. The laws do not apply to them until, suddenly, they do. Of the two legal calamities befalling Trump, the plea bargain of his personal fixer is even more disastrous than the guilty verdicts slapped down on his campaign chairman. Although letâ€™s be honest: the scale of both disasters makes it a close call.

And again â€¦ Weisselberg. From before the election, the Trump Organization CFO has been pointed out as the man who knows all the secrets going back to when the Trump at the top of the tower was Donaldâ€™s father. Michael Cohen may buried the bodies, but Weisselberg paid the bills. And kept the receipts.

Campaign finance crimes of this kind are not trivial matters: under federal guidelines updated at the end of last year by Trumpâ€™s own justice department, a campaign finance crime committed knowingly and willfully amounting to more than $25,000 is what they call a five-year felony. Just one of Cohenâ€™s payments, made at Trumpâ€™s direction, amounted to $130,000.

And those penalties are compounded by efforts to obstruct the investigation. Efforts that are still ongoing.

Ian Samuel doesnâ€™t think Trump is going anywhere any time soon.

Cohenâ€™s guilty plea, along with the conviction of Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager Paul Manafort of unrelated tax and fraud crimes, have undoubtedly left some thinking that the net is finally closing around Trump, and that the global nightmare of his presidency is at last entering its final hours. Surely, proof that the president was personally involved in a criminal conspiracy to violate the election laws will be the last straw, wonâ€™t it?

Of course not. But dammit, thatâ€™s a whole lot of straw.

But while it is surely to the good to bag a few swamp creatures, whether it places Trumpâ€™s presidency in any actual danger is a much different question. That is because (despite what you may have learned on The West Wing) politics is not about being right, or virtuous; it is about power. And to endanger Trumpâ€™s grip on the presidency, these convictions would have to somehow endanger the concrete powers that keep him there.

Looking around the House floor now â€¦ Nope, heâ€™s not in trouble. But check with me again in November.

Economy

James Galbraith on the incredible robbery thatâ€™s going on every day.

A new report from the Economic Policy Institute calls attention to the hardy perennial of how much Americaâ€™s corporate titans make: bosses of the top 350 firms made an average of $18.9m in 2017. Thatâ€™s a ratio of 312-1 over the median worker in their industries. Big bucks to be sure. And a big change since 1965, when the ratio was just 20-1. But what does it mean? And if thereâ€™s a problem, what is it, exactly? What it means, as the EPI economists carefully document, is that the top US corporate chiefs are paid overwhelmingly with stock options, and their income fluctuates with the market. About 80% of the pay packet is in stocks, and the rise of 17% in 2017 after two flat years surely suggests that the top CEOs (not unreasonably) sensed the market peaked last year. So they cashed in. On the other 20% of the pay packets, no gains occurred.

For those Democratic candidates still looking for something to talk about this November. I suggest this: Letâ€™s tax the hell out of the rich. I donâ€™t mean increase the taxes on a billion bucks by 2 percent, with some nice deductions. I mean tax The. Hell. out of them. Like â€¦ 90 percent on all income over a million. Itâ€™s a start. And they still get all the deductions they want, so long as those deductions are called â€œpay someone else or spend it on improving your business and donâ€™t take it home in your own pocket.â€ And then maybe we fix a bridge, or build some new schools. But first The Hell. Taxed. Out of them.

Is the US really so exceptional? Compared to Japan, probably so; the Japanese have largely retained the successful industrial model that displaced major American industrial firms a generation back. Compared to Germany, we canâ€™t know; German firms are in greater proportion privately held, so they donâ€™t report, and German elites have memories of the that induce caution and discretion, not advertisement of their wealth. Compared to British bankers, likely thereâ€™s not much to choose between the ultra-wealthy of London and New York. Letâ€™s not get started on Russian oligarchs or Saudi princes, compared to whom US CEOs earn a pittance.

But until we figure out how to tax those oligarchs and princes â€¦ tax The Hell out of the wealthy here at home. If that 90 percent thing seems off, we can always just take it all.

Jefferson BEAUREGARD Sessions III

Dana Milbank on the hourâ€™s least likely hero â€¦ because heâ€™s so, so not.

Let us now praise Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III. Rejected for a judgeship by the Senate over accusations of racism, the Alabamian later became a senator known for hostility toward the Voting Rights Act, outspoken opposition to (even legal) immigration, and being the first senator to back Donald Trump for president.

The racist jerkwad who is also an occassional thorn in Trumpâ€™s side, is still a racist jerkwad. And if you forget that for a moment, just wait. Sessions will certainly take action to remind you.

For the umpteenth time, Trump this past week attacked his attorney general, whom he once dubbed â€œMr. Magoo,â€ over Sessionsâ€™s proper decision to recuse himself from the Trump-Russia investigation. â€œWhat kind of a man is this?â€ Trump asked on Fox News. The assault continued Friday morning. â€¦ This week may turn out to have been a turning point. It was the moment the justice system landed two blows against an unfit leader: the conviction of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on charges related to bank and tax fraud, and the guilty plea by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who implicated Trump in a campaign finance crime. More significantly, Trumpâ€™s own people began to turn against him.

When Trump falls, I really do want them to give him a phone so he can continue to tweet from prison. Sessionsâ€™ name is going to come up. A lot. I donâ€™t follow Trumpâ€™s Twitter account now. But lock him up, and Iâ€™ll be there.

Brett Kavanaugh

Lawrence Tribe on why Kavanaughâ€™s hearings shouldnâ€™t be heard.

â€¦ Imagine a Trump appointee to the court â€” one named as impeachment clouds were gathering and seemingly selected with a presidential eye focused sharply on his pro-presidential writings â€” casting the deciding vote in a future case against Trump, involving an issue such as the presidentâ€™s obligation to comply with a subpoena to testify or the presidentâ€™s amenability to indictment. If that doesnâ€™t sit right with you, youâ€™re not alone: It didnâ€™t sit right with the framers, either. The framers built the Constitution on the premise that men arenâ€™t angels, and they did not trust a presidentâ€™s nominees to the Supreme Court to be impartial in determining whether he should stay in office. At the Constitutional Convention, Virginiaâ€™s George Mason thought judges â€œsurelyâ€ ought not preside over the impeachment trials of presidents to whom they owed their jobs; Connecticutâ€™s Roger Sherman agreed. So the framers came up with a solution: They assigned the impeachment power to the House and the power to try impeachments to the Senate.

George Will also wrote about Kavanaugh this morning, and he used the exact same picture as Tribe for his column. Donâ€™t they coordinate at the Washington Post? Donâ€™t Larry and George get together and â€¦ no, no. Probably not.

Miscellaneous Trumpian Nightmare Mishmash

Colbert King tries to imagine how itâ€™s going to go in churches that send their voters out to support Trump.

36818Z1KV4V9GGVMZ35ER6N0A0ZA3G,"Trump asks supporters, 'What other country has judges?'","Last fall, Donald Trumpâ€™s White House insisted that when it comes to immigration, the nation needed hundreds of additional immigration judges in order to expedite the legal process at the U.S./Mexico border. Indeed, the presidentâ€™s position was that this was absolutely necessary â€“ and if Democrats wanted to extend DACA protections to Dreamers, theyâ€™d agree to pay for these judges, among other things.

Recently, however, Trump decided heâ€™s opposed to his idea. Just last week, the president spoke to the National Federation of Independent Businesses and expressed bewilderment that â€œtheyâ€ â€“ he didnâ€™t say who â€“ want more immigration judges, which Trump said would invite â€œgraftâ€ and corruption.

Current federal immigration judges were reportedly â€œshockedâ€ and â€œdismayedâ€ by the presidentâ€™s criticisms.

Trump, however, is pressing forward, questioning why we even have immigration judges and wondering about the need for due process. The president addressed the subject last night at a rally in South Carolina.

â€œThey came to me three days ago. â€˜Sir, weâ€™d like you to sign this order.â€™ What is the order? â€˜We need five thousand judges on the border.â€™ I said, â€˜Judges?â€™ What other country has judges? I said, â€˜How many do we have now?â€™ They didnâ€™t even know. So we have thousands of judges and now weâ€™re going to have five thousand. Now, Iâ€™ve done a good job with judges, Judge Gorsuch, Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch. [Trump at this point went on a tangent about his greatness on picking judges, before returning to the subject at hand.] â€œBut they come up, and this was an order, this was â€“ â€˜Sir, we need five thousand judges.â€™ I said, â€˜Five thousand?â€™ So, we put a judge on like on the bench, federal, it takes us weeks to vet, it takes us a long time to get the judges, one â€“ weâ€™re talking about one person. And they want five thousand, I said, â€˜Where are you going to find five thousand people to be judges? How many do we have now?â€™ â€˜I donâ€™t know the number.â€™ They donâ€™t even know the number, even though theyâ€™re in charge, OK? Nobody knows the number. We have thousands of judges already.â€

Itâ€™s important to understand the unavoidable fact that Trump has no idea what heâ€™s talking about.

First, literally no one involved in this process has recommended an additional 5,000 immigration judges. The president keeps repeating the number, but itâ€™s entirely made up.

Second, the actual proposal was for a few hundred additional immigration judges, and that idea was endorsed by his own White House.

Third, there are 334 immigration judges currently serving, so when Trump said, â€œNobody knows the number,â€ itâ€™s because heâ€™s too lazy to check.

And finally, Trump makes no distinction between immigration judges and judges who currently sit on the federal bench as part of the Article III courts.

As the Washington Post explained, â€œ[T]he U.S. judicial branch has nearly 1,300 sitting federal judges. This includes all Article III judges who sit in the district courts, the courts of appeal, the Court of International Trade and the Supreme Court. Immigration judges are not counted toward this total, since they work in the executive branch, inside the Justice Department.â€

Either no one at the White House has explained this to the president, or aides have explained it to him and Trump simply didnâ€™t understand the lesson.

Either way, the presidentâ€™s rhetoric on the subject is increasingly incoherent.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-asks-supporters-what-other-country-has-judges,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic']","['4', '1', '5', '1', '5']"
3T6SSHJUZGS3C1W3WU4ECAD863SII9,Judge Says Suit Challenging Citizenship Question On 2020 Census Can Advance,"A federal judge in New York ruled Thursday that a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's decision to add a question asking about citizenship to the 2020 census could advance, saying the challengers had shown enough evidence that the decision could have been driven by discrimination to move the case forward.

While making it clear that the merits of the lawsuit would be decided in the future, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman said the challengers had presented enough evidence for the cause to continue.

""Courts have a critical role to play in reviewing the conduct of the political branches to ensure that the census is conducted in a manner consistent with the Constitution and applicable law,"" Furman, who was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, wrote in his ruling. ""Assuming the truth of their allegations and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor, the Court finds that NGO Plaintiffs plausibly allege that Secretary Ross's decision to reinstate the citizenship question was motivated at least in part by discriminatory animus and will result in a discriminatory effect.""

Furman pointed to President Donald Trump's harsh statements about immigrants, including one in which he said some come from ""shithole countries,"" as evidence the decision to add a citizenship question could have been motivated by ""discriminatory animus.""

The ruling is a preliminary victory for the plaintiffs in the case, led by 18 states and a coalition of immigration rights groups who say the administration's decision was ""arbitrary"" and ""capricious,"" violating federal law. They also say the decision was motivated by an intent to discriminate and drive down the census response rate among immigrant communities.

The Trump administration requested the case be dismissed, saying Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had broad discretion to decide what was on the census and there was no standard for the court to decide what was appropriate for the census. The decision is not discriminatory, the Trump administration says, because officials are making every effort to ensure that all persons are counted in 2020.

A Commerce Department spokesman said in a statement the agency was confident it would ultimately win the suit.

""The Department of Commerce is pleased the court found that Secretary Ross has broad authority over the Census,"" the spokesman said. ""We are confident that this includes the authority to reinstate a citizenship question and that Plaintiffs' remaining claims will be dismissed after discovery shows that the Secretary lawfully exercised his discretion to do so.""

The case is being closely watched because civil rights groups are worried that adding the citizenship question will cause minority groups not to respond to the survey, which is only done once every 10 years. The data collected in the census is used to determine how many members of Congress each state gets and how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds are allocated.

""Today's decision is a big win for New Yorkers and everyone across the country who cares about a fair and accurate Census,"" said New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood (D), who is leading the coalition of state attorneys general in the lawsuit. ""As we've argued, the Trump administration's plan to demand citizenship status as part of the Census is unlawful - and it would potentially cause a huge undercount that would threaten billions in federal funds and New York's fair representation in Congress and the Electoral College.""

While the case will continue, Furman tossed out one part of the plaintiffs' complaint in which they alleged the addition of a citizenship question violated a constitutional provision that the government count ""all persons.""

Furman also questioned the Commerce Department's rationale for adding the citizenship question. Ross initially said that he began considering adding a citizenship question after the Justice Department requested it so it could better enforce the Voting Rights Act. But in a memo disclosed as part of the lawsuit, Ross said he actually began considering the possibility of adding a question months before the Justice Department's request. Ross also disclosed it was the Commerce Department that asked DOJ to request a citizenship question. Documents made public this week show Ross was impatient to get a citizenship question on the census soon after he was confirmed and how a top Commerce Department official approached DOJ to get the agency to request adding the question.

""While Secretary Ross initially (and repeatedly) suggested that the Department of Justice's request triggered his consideration of the issue, it now appears that the sequence of events was exactly opposite,"" he wrote.

Furman also noted that the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965 and the Justice Department has never said it needed better citizenship data to enforce the law.

3L21G7IH48EE2VFAS55B6ZQAFYBY1R,Lack of Prep Plagued Trump's Child Separation Border Policy,"The Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' immigration crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border earlier this year was plagued by a lack of preparation, resource shortfalls and communication failures, according to a government audit released on Tuesday.

The review, conducted by the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General, is the first official audit of President Donald Trump's policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, criminally prosecuting parents and sending their children to shelters and foster homes across the country.

Trump administration officials have said the policy, under which some 2,600 children were separated from their parents, was needed to secure the border and deter illegal immigration.

Trump was forced to end the policy after widespread public furor over the separations and the chaotic way in which they were conducted, with hundreds of parents deported without their children.

The audit also found that hundreds of migrant children were detained for longer than the three-day limit allowed at U.S. Border Patrol facilities, including one who was held for 25 days.

By law, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has very basic holding facilities, is allowed to detain unaccompanied migrant children for up to 72 hours before transferring them to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Jim Crumpacker, a DHS official who responds to oversight reports, wrote in an attached appendix that ""CBP and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officers and agents continually uphold the utmost professionalism while maintaining efficient border operations.""

The audit also found serious issues with how records on separated families were kept. After the separations, the government struggled to ""identify, track, and reunify parents and children"" in part because technology systems used by agencies within DHS and HHS could not directly share information.

Border Patrol agents did not take measures to ensure that young children who could not yet talk could be correctly identified, failing to provide them with identifying wrist bracelets or fingerprinting or photographing most children, the report said.

Furthermore, claims by DHS in late June that it had a ""central database"" containing information for separated parents and children were not backed up by the review. The inspector general ""found no evidence that such a database exists,"" the report said.

As a result, it took DHS ""many weeks"" to provide the inspector general with basic information on migrant children separated from their parents, and the data, when finally provided, was ""incomplete and inconsistent.""

According to a court filing by the government on Thursday, 136 children separated under the 'zero tolerance' policy remain in government custody and apart from their parents.

A year after torch-carrying white nationalists at the â€œUnite the Rightâ€ rally shocked the nation by marching through Charlottesville, Virginia, the movement appears more fragmented than ever but also riding a series of policy wins implemented by the Trump administration.

Followers of the white nationalist movement, portions of which define themselves as the â€œalt-right,â€ leaped to prominence during the 2016 presidential campaign and then drew international attention after the widely televised Charlottesville rally on Aug. 11, 2017, ostensibly over the removal of a Confederate statue. The rally's second day quickly devolved into chaos and ended with the death of a counterprotester who police say was deliberately rammed by a white nationalist now facing murder charges.

It wasnâ€™t the last time adherents grabbed headlines, but there appears to have been a significant shift in how white nationalists are organizing and communicating. Theyâ€™ve seen their access to television and mainstream social media platforms limited and have shifted their conversations to more private online chat rooms, websites like Reddit and apps like Gab, creating an echo chamber of racial resentment that still erupts publicly.

Many of the most recognizable names and faces of the movement, including Richard Spencer, Kyle Bristow and Jason Kessler, appear to be reconsidering their specific approaches, even if they aren't backing down from their beliefs.

â€œThere seems to have been a dog-whistle call in, saying to those who have these philosophies, that itâ€™s OK again to promote them, that itâ€™s acceptable to be public about it,â€ said Hilary Shelton, the director of the NAACP's bureau in Washington, D.C.

Generally speaking, white nationalists seek to protect a white, European-descended heritage in the United States by marginalizing or excluding other groups. The movement has gained broader public acceptance by downplaying the white hoods and robes of the KKK while still focusing on its goal of a United States run by and for white people. They claim the white race faces genocide through mainstream efforts toward diversity and multiculturalism, a belief driven by the nation's changing demographics.

â€œThe hard-core hate world decided that the street-level violence and Nazi symbology wasnâ€™t a good sell,â€ said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University-San Bernardino. â€œWhat theyâ€™re now saying is that European culture and Western civilization is being thrown overboard for some globalistic goal that is not taking care of our citizens.â€

To civil rights activists, white nationalism is a repudiation of what they say has made America great: strength through diversity, including the acceptance of immigrants from around the world. They say it's enshrined in the Constitution, engraved into the Statue of Liberty and echoed every time we recite the Pledge of Allegiance.

The white nationalist movement defies easy description, in part because it lacks formal leadership or structure. Instead, adherents espouse a wide range of views, from limiting immigration to forcible separation of races. Other facets seek a more militant, male-dominated culture.

But Trump's repeated calls to build a wall on the Mexican border and ban refugees from several Muslim countries have emboldened white nationalists who see stricter border controls as an important first step. They also welcomed Trump's warning that traditional European culture was being altered by immigrants from Muslim countries.

""I just think it is changing the culture, I think it is a very negative thing for Europe,"" Trump said last month. ""I know it is politically not necessarily correct to say that, but I will say it and I will say it loud.""

Millions of conservative white voters who back Trump believe former President Barack Obama is largely to blame for fanning the flames of racial resentment and dividing the country. They blame him for the rise of Black Lives Matter and agree with Trumpâ€™s comments that â€œmany sidesâ€ are responsible for racial violence.

Shelton said Obama merely â€“ and even then only quietly â€“ talked about long-simmering issues of racial inequality that many whites would rather just ignore. Now, some of those white identity groups have seized upon that frustration to drive wedges between racial groups that civil rights leaders have spent decades trying to unify.

â€œWe have those who wonâ€™t take a look at the full picture, because itâ€™s uncomfortable,"" Shelton said. â€œThe reality of now is it becomes harder to have that conversation.â€

That conversation has instead trended toward intolerance and hatred. More than 950 hate groups operated in the country last year, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported, the majority of them focused on white supremacy. The law center said thereâ€™s about three times as many white hate groups as black, and the black groups â€œhave virtually no supporters or influence in mainstream politics, much less in the White House.â€

Overall, the number of extremist groups, which also include armed militias and male supremacy organizations, rose 4 percent since 2016, the law center said.

Last August's demonstrations shook Charlottesville. On the evening of Aug. 11, hundreds of torch-bearing protesters, accompanied by armed men, marched through the University of Virginia campus, chanting white supremacist slogans. The next day, the group swamped downtown Charlottesville and rioting broke out when they were met by counterprotesters. Several people were injured, and one woman, Heather Heyer, 32, died when she was struck by a car.

That pattern has been repeated several times around the country: a small group of white nationalists march through a cityâ€™s streets, confronted by similarly militant counterprotesters.

That's why authorities are so nervous about this weekend's planned Unite the Right 2 rally in Washington, D.C. To prepare for any violence, Charlottesville and parts of Northern Virginia will be under a state of emergency through the weekend.

Gov. Ralph Northam and city officials announced the declaration, which will be in effect Friday through Sunday for the university town of 47,000 people and parts of Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C.

Far-left activists, including anarchists, anti-fascists (known commonly as antifa) and Black Lives Matter groups are planning a major counterdemonstration Aug. 12 that will coincide with the Unite the Right 2 ""white civil rights"" rally in Washington, D.C.'s Lafayette Square marking one year since the events in Charlottesville. It's unclear whether any other white nationalist rallies will take place around the country, but officials nationwide are bracing for the possibility.

â€œAll of their rallies are resistance to our progress. They are not simply debates,"" said Makia Green, an organizer with Black Lives Matter D.C., who criticized the notion that white nationalists simply want to demonstrate their First Amendment rights. ""White supremacist rallies have left a trail of blood in D.C.""

Spencer, once one of the country's most visible white nationalists, has dramatically scaled back his public appearances in part as a result of that violence. He said he's not attending this weekend's rally in D.C.

Spencer entered the public eye during the 2016 presidential campaign in part by his willingness to publicly discuss and debate ""white pride,"" which he portrayed as an intellectual exercise. Although Spencer said he eschews violence personally, his critics said there would be an inevitably violent response to attempts to create a whites-only country that would force minorities to leave.

Spencer's former attorney, Kyle Bristow, has stepped back from the group they co-founded, the Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, a generically named group providing advice to would-be white nationalists. Bristow said in March that he was disassociating from the alt-right people and groups he had represented, including Cameron Padgett, a Spencer ally who booked his visits to college campuses.

""I know that many have good intentions in going, but a rally like this (does not) make sense at this time,"" Spencer said in a statement Tuesday. ""I don't know exactly what will happen, but it probably will not be good.""

Longtime civil rights activist Eric Ward said he believes some white nationalists were truly surprised by the level of violence associated with their rallies, marches and speeches. Spencer said in March of his appearances: â€œWhen they become violent clashes and pitched battles, they arenâ€™t fun. I donâ€™t inspire any kind of violence. ... Until the situation changes, we are up a creek without a paddle.â€

Ward, of the Portland, Oregon-based Western States Center, said new white nationalist leaders are stepping into the leadership gap left by people like Spencer, organizing online and largely out of the public eye. A rally by white nationalist-affiliated groups descended into violent clashes last weekend in Portland, with police firing stun grenades at counterprotesters.

â€œWhat comes out of Charlottesville a year later is for the first time there is a well-defined paramilitary movement on the far right. Thatâ€™s new,"" Ward said. ""And the level of coordination and commitment is very new.â€

Ward said white nationalists have shifted the national conversation from a reflexive rejection of Nazi-like beliefs, which allows white people to feel more comfortable publicly scapegoating immigrants. Immigration reform, he said, has become a proxy fight for a discussion about white identity and what it means to be an American, especially at a time when Hispanic birth rates are set to make whites a minority by 2045.

Kessler, who is organizing the Unite the Right 2 rally, said he plans to focus on ""white civil rights"" â€“ what he sees as limited rights for white people, particularly surrounding free speech. Only American and Confederate flags will be allowed at the D.C. event, Kessler said â€“ no neo-Nazi paraphernalia.

â€œWhat Iâ€™m really trying to do is start a new movement,"" Kessler said. ""I feel like the 'alt-right' has been a symbol for neo-Nazism."" Although the theme is white rights, he said the rally is ""open to everybody.""

Ward said white nationalists have succeeded by marching under the umbrella of free speech and making anyone who opposes them the bad guys. In Portland last weekend, city leaders equally condemned the white nationalists who rallied and the self-described ""anti-fascists"" who opposed them, Ward said. There was a time, he said, when no one would have felt comfortable equating those two groups, especially in the aftermath of World War II, when the United States fought the Nazis and helped liberate concentration camps.

""They have created a space where people truly believe, leaders truly believe, that whatâ€™s happening is a fight between two political gangs rather than the reality, which is that liberal cities are being attacked by white nationalists,"" Ward said. â€œWhite nationalism as a social phenomenon is here to stay. The genie is out of the bottle, and itâ€™s not going back in.â€

The child, who is under the age of five, had been with a parent who was apprehended at the border on an outstanding warrant by the U.S. Marshals Service. In Thurday's court filing, lawyers for the government wrote that the parent ""may or may not be a United States citizen."" On Tuesday, the lawyers wrote ""records show the parent and child might be U.S. citizens.""

A representative for U.S. Health and Human Services did not reply to questions from CBS News about the type of facilities where the child has been housed since 2015. HHS oversees a foster care network as well as more than 100 childrens' shelters.

The Justice Department's court filing twice refers to the child as ""her,"" but a representative of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that agency's records indicate the child is a boy. CBS News has reached out to multiple federal agencies for clarification.

""The adult described in the court filing presented herself and her minor son, born in Mexico, at a U.S. port of entry on the Texas border on Nov. 25, 2015,"" said ICE spokesperson Danielle Bennett in an email to CBS News. ""The parent was remanded to USMS custody on an outstanding warrant. At no time did she enter ICE custody.""

Although when separated the parent was in the custody of the U.S. Marshals, a federal law enforcement agency, the government has since lost track of the parent, according to the filing.

""Defendants (the government) have not been aware of the parent's location since then and they remain unable to locate that parent,"" Justice Department lawyers wrote in the court filing.

It is not clear if the parent was charged, jailed, released, or transferred to any other federal agencies after the 2015 separation.

""Because the parent is not available, it is not possible to reunite the child with the parent. Unless the parent is located, [HHS] will provide care and seek placement for the child using its ordinary programs and procedures,"" the Justice Department lawyers wrote.

Lee Gelernt, an ACLU lawyer involved in the lawsuit demanding that separated children be reunited, said in a text message to CBS News that the organization is attempting to track the mother down.

""The government doesn't know where the mother is now, so we will try to find her,"" Gelernt said, adding that the ACLU has not been told the woman's identity.

In response to questions about the mother, a spokesperson for the U.S. Marshals referred CBS News to the Justice Department, which declined to comment.

The child is one of 103 children under the age of five who were separated from their parents near the border, before a federal judge ordered the government to reunite them by July 10. The government has since ruled 46 of those children, including the possibly-American child, are currently ineligible for reunification.

Reasons for ineligibility range from the parent having already been deported to the adult not actually being a parent â€” though in some cases those ruled ineligible are relatives such as grandmas and an uncle â€”and failures of criminal background checks. Criminal histories referenced range from the violent and sexual to some not always associated with the loss of childcare privileges, such as three adults who had previous drunk driving arrests.

The government has until July 26 to reunite nearly 2,800 other children, ages five through 17, currently in its custody.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-child-was-separated-from-parent-at-border-in-2015/,"['Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Neutral']","['5', '4', '5', '5', '5']"
3MDKGGG61R5DSVHDO5UTTEPC8GLT6P,"Most Americans oppose key parts of Trump immigration plans, including wall, limits on citizens bringing family to U.S., poll says","Americans overwhelmingly oppose the Trump administrationâ€™s now-rescinded policy of separating immigrant children from their parents, and smaller majorities also disagree with the presidentâ€™s call to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and to restrict legal immigration by limiting citizens from bringing parents and siblings to this country, according to a new Washington Post-Schar School poll.

On other aspects of the immigration debate, however, a more mixed picture emerges. Americans are more closely divided on the question of whether enough is being done to prevent illegal immigration and whether the country has gone too far in welcoming immigrants. Also, more people say they trust President Trump than congressional Democrats to deal with the issue of border security. The support for Trump on the border-security issue is especially evident in congressional districts considered key battlegrounds in this fallâ€™s midterm elections.





Democrats appear more energized than Republicans about the fall elections, especially in battleground districts. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters in those districts, 59 percent say the midterms are extremely important, compared with 46 percent of Â­Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Overall, registered voters say they prefer to vote for a Democrat over a Republican for the House, 47 percent to 37 percent. The margin on that question is not statistically larger in battleground districts, standing at 12 percentage points.

[Read full poll results]

The nation remains deeply Â­divided along party lines, as it has been throughout and before Trumpâ€™s presidency. Two other divisions define the political environment of 2018. On issues of immigration, as well as questions about Trumpâ€™s presidency, the gaps between men and women and between white voters with and without college degrees are sizable. Women and white college-educated voters are far more dissatisfied with the president and his policies than are men and white voters without college educations. However, gaps based on education are less significant in battleground districts.

Trumpâ€™s overall approval stands at 43 percent, while his disapproval is 55 percent. Among men, 54 percent approve; among women, 32 percent approve.

His handling of immigration draws slightly higher disapproval, with 39 percent approving and 59 percent disapproving. More than twice as many say they strongly disapprove as say they strongly approve. Among men, 51 percent disapprove, but among women, 67 percent disapprove. Among whites with college educations, 68 percent disapprove, but among non-college whites, 56 percent approve.

Trumpâ€™s best numbers come on the economy: 50 percent approve, while 48 percent disapprove. Majorities nationally and in both battleground and non-battleground districts rate the economy as excellent or good. Men are far more positive than women â€” 26 points more likely to approve of his handling of the economy and 13 points more likely to rate the economy positively.

On trade issues, the public sides with the president on one key question: whether the United Statesâ€™ long-term trading partners have taken advantage of this country. By 52 percent to 43 percent, Americans agree with Trump rather than saying the nationâ€™s partners trade fairly. In battleground districts, the margin is slightly larger.

But even in agreeing with the president on that question, Americans show little support for his aggressive trade policies, such as his calls for tariffs on a variety of products that have rattled financial markets and angered U.S. allies.

Barely 4 in 10 Americans, 41 percent, approve overall of Trumpâ€™s handling of the trade issue. On two other questions â€” how his trade policies will affect jobs in the United States and the cost of products here â€” majorities of Americans say the impact will be bad rather than good, and nearly 3 in 4 say the impact on the cost of products will be bad.

The survey, sponsored by The Post and the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, was conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago between June 27 and July 2 online and by phone. The survey drew from the firmâ€™s probability-design AmeriSpeak panel, interviewing a total of 1,473 adults, including 865 who live in one of 58 congressional districts classified by the Cook Political Report as â€œtoss-upâ€ or â€œleaningâ€ toward one party.

The survey looked at a variety of aspects of the immigration debate, which has been front and center since the outcry over the separation of immigrant children from parents who were detained after coming across the border.

On immigration, almost 7 in 10 (69 percent) say they opposed the policy that separated immigrant children from their parents, compared with 29 percent who supported the policy. About 6 in 10 Republicans supported it.

Trumpâ€™s decision to reverse the policy drew widespread support, with three-quarters of Americans backing that decision. Asked about what to do now, a majority of Americans say they want families detained together rather than temporarily released until their court appearances and possible deportation.

The vivid imagery of the children contributed to the backlash that forced Trump to reverse course. About 3 in 4 say they were bothered by the photos and stories about children being held separately from their parents, and nearly half of all Americans â€” including 6 in 10 women â€” said they were bothered a lot.

But as to who is to blame for families being separated, the public is more divided, with 37 percent saying the Trump administration bears responsibility, 35 percent saying the blame goes to migrant families trying to enter the United States and 25 percent saying both are equally to blame. A 41 percent plurality of women blame the Trump administration, while a 43 percent plurality of men blame migrants.





Trumpâ€™s suggestion that U.S. immigration policy has become a magnet for criminals and gang members is rejected by most Americans. Roughly 4 in 10 say the biggest reason most people enter illegally is to flee danger in their own countries, with another 4 in 10 saying they are drawn because of economic opportunities. Just 6 percent nationally say most people enter as part of the drug trade or gangs.

A plurality of Americans (48 percent) say that this countryâ€™s history of welcoming immigrants has been mainly good, while 4 in 10 say it has been both good and bad, and 11 percent say it has been mainly bad. As to whether immigration has gone too far, Americans are divided into three almost equal groups, with about a third saying it has gone too far, a third saying it has not gone far enough, and almost a third saying the right balance has been struck.

A bare majority (51 percent) say the United States is doing enough to keep illegal immigrants from coming into the country, compared with 46 percent who do not. But that bare majority who feel enough is being done is considerably higher than it was during the first decade of this century. The overall results mask deep differences between the parties, with 2 in 3 Democrats saying enough is being done, while just 1 in 3 Republicans agree.

Of the different policies measured in this poll, large majorities of Americans support allowing young immigrants who arrived as children and met certain requirements to remain (84 percent); a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants living here if they pass a background check (81 percent); requiring employers to verify their hires are in the United States legally (78 percent); and more funding for border security (65 percent). Majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents agree with those policies.

On the policies that Americans oppose â€” the child-separation policy, building the border wall and restricting legal immigration â€” majorities of Republicans favor them, in contrast to majorities of Democrats and independents who oppose them.

More broadly, Democrats in Congress lead Trump when it comes to whom voters trust to handle immigration by a 38 percent to 30 percent margin, with 24 percent trusting neither. But on border security, Trump holds a 10-point edge over Democrats, which balloons to 17 points in congressional battleground districts.

Immigration is seen by voters as one of the three most important issues in this fallâ€™s congressional elections, along with jobs and the economy, and health care. Immigration is cited by 19 percent of voters, jobs and the economy by 24 percent, and health care by 20 percent. Republicans hold a narrow 47 percent to 40 percent advantage in support among Â­immigration-focused voters; that finding suggests this could be an issue that motivates the GOP base in November.





Gun laws, which some Democrats hope will motivate their voters in November, rank fourth at 14 percent, while taxes, an issue the GOP is counting on â€” along with the economy â€” to prevent substantial losses rank fifth at 8 percent.

As with immigration policy, there were clear partisan differences: Among Democrats, the top three issues are health care, guns and the economy. Republicans rank immigration and the economy in a virtual tie at the top, with health care, taxes and guns bunched together but far behind the top two.

The survey also asked about other aspects of the Trump presidency. More people say they will vote in November to show opposition to Trump (37 percent) than say they will be trying to show support for him (25 percent), while 36 percent say he will not be a factor.

Asked whether Republican candidates in general are too supportive or too critical of the president, voters say, 51 percent to 21 percent, that the GOP candidates have been too supportive, with the remainder saying the candidates are striking the right balance. Almost half say Democrats running for Congress are too critical of Trump â€” and that rises to a slight majority in battleground districts.

Two in 3 Americans say the president tells the truth only some of the time or hardly ever, a finding consistent across battleground and non-battleground districts. More than one-third of all Americans say he hardly ever tells the truth.

Nearly half of all Americans (48 percent) say that, regardless of their personal feelings about the president, they think he is doing more to damage important values. Not quite 4 in 10 (37 percent) say he is doing more to protect those values.

The nation is closely divided in its view of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible ties between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. Currently, 49 percent approve of the way special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is handling the investigation, while 45 percent disapprove.

Those divisions extend to the question of whether Trump campaign officials colluded with the Russians. The percentages saying that this is a serious issue and that it is more of a distraction are identical â€” 48 percent apiece. But the responses on all of the Mueller questions were highly partisan, with strong majorities of Democrats supporting the special counsel and the investigation and equally strong percentages of Republicans opposing them.

The margin of sampling error for overall survey results is plus or minus five percentage points.

When Vennia Francois, a woman of color, discusses politics with people, many of them automatically assume she's a Democrat.

In recent years, identity politics have pushed the notion that all black Americans are Democrats, which is why many are surprised when they find out Francois is a Republican running for office in Florida's 7th Congressional district, near Winter Park.

""Typically, African Americans tend to sway Democrat,"" Francois told ""Good Morning America.""

""I am an American first and foremost, and anything else is secondary, but my cultural background is Caribbean American,"" she stated.

In the 2016 presidential election, only 8 percent of black voters voted for Donald Trump, with about 88 percent backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls. Those numbers were reflected in Florida, a battleground state where non-whites made up 40 percent of voters, a group with which Clinton did very well.

Despite the numbers, Francois said she believes, morally, African Americans align with the Republican party.

ABC NewsVennia Francois doorknocks in Winter Park, Fla.



""Majority of African Americans -- they are conservative morally, conservative by nature, and I do believe we need representation on both sides of the aisle,"" she said.

There are currently only three black Republican members of Congress.

Trump's approval ratings among black Americans have been low -- 92 percent of blacks disapprove of the president, according to a recent poll by the Associated Press/NORC. In Francois' district, nearly 80 percent of residents identify as white, according to the 2010 U.S. Census. Even though minorities make up a smaller portion of her district, she believes her party as a whole can do a better job of reaching out to blacks.

""I think the Republican party has just lost their messaging, and they feel that the Republican party just doesn't come into their communities outside other than the fact that only when it's time for an election,"" she said. ""We need to do better in reaching out to these communities.""

Francois, an attorney, is one of nine children and a first-generation American who was born and raised in Florida. Her parents immigrated from the Bahamas in the 1970s. At the time, her parents had six kids.

""They wanted to make sure their kids at the time had a better education, and so they decided to move,"" she said. ""But they did it legally, and they did it the right way.""

Francois says although her family's journey to America has made her sensitive to issues surrounding immigration, she believes in strict border enforcement.


â€œâ€All be it that Iâ€™m an underdog but I am certainly getting out there and meeting the voters.



""Securing our borders is not only a national security issue, it's also about our moral standing around the world, combating human trafficking as well as getting control with the proliferation of drugs that's pouring over across our borders,"" she said.

Still, she said it was ""heart-wrenching"" to see thousands of children being separated from their families at the border amid the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.

""I do believe that families do need to stick together,"" she said.

After immigrating to the United States, her parents settled in Orlando and became a part of their community through their church.

Now, that church community and her family and friends are helping Francois power her grassroots campaign that's focused on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, securing a border wall and reforming federal student loan programs in a district that's home to one of the nation's largest schools, the University of Central Florida.

ABC NewsVennia Francois sits with family and friends in church.



Francois is a first-time candidate at a time where there's a wave of women running for office. The spike is largely on the Democratic side, with 350 women filing to run for the House compared with 118 Republicans, according to the Center for Women and American Politics at Rutgers University.

Francois was inspired to run after the current Democratic incumbent Rep. Stephanie Murphy claimed a marginal victory over former Rep. John Mica by just 3 points in 2016.

""I knew that someone had to step up,"" she said.

Francois will face off against two other Republicans, Rep. Mike Miller and businessman Scott Sturgill, in the state's Aug. 28 primary.

""I am the underdog,"" she said, ""but I am certainly getting out there and meeting the voters and letting them know who I am, and why I am the best person to win this race. And it's all about who can beat the incumbent in November, and I know that I'm the only Republican candidate in this race that can and will.""

Senator John McCain, the Vietnam war hero turned senator and presidential candidate, has died aged 81.

Mr McCain died on Saturday in Arizona surrounded by his family, a statement from his office said.

He was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in July 2017 and had been undergoing medical treatment.

His family announced on Friday that Mr McCain, who left Washington in December, had decided to cease treatment.

His widow, Cindy, tweeted: ""My heart is broken. I am so lucky to have lived the adventure of loving this incredible man for 38 years. He passed the way he lived, on his own terms, surrounded by the people he loved, in the place he loved best.""

Mr McCain's daughter Meghan said the task of her lifetime would now be ""to live up to his example, his expectations, and his love"".

Following news of his death, wellwishers waving flags lined the street as a hearse brought Mr McCain's body from his ranch in Sedona, Arizona, to a funeral home in Phoenix.

The six-term senator for Arizona and 2008 Republican presidential nominee was diagnosed after doctors discovered his tumour during surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye last July.

His family said he would lie in state in Phoenix, Arizona, and in Washington DC before a funeral at the Washington National Cathedral and his burial in Annapolis, Maryland.

Former presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush are expected to give eulogies.

The son and grandson of Navy admirals, Mr McCain was a fighter pilot during the war in Vietnam. When his plane was shot down, he spent more than five years as a prisoner of war.

While in the custody of his captors, he suffered torture that left him with lasting disabilities.

In politics, he took a conservative line on many issues, including opposing abortion and advocating higher defence spending. He backed the 2003 invasion of Iraq and criticised President Obama for not intervening more in the Syrian civil war.

However, he also gained a reputation as a Republican maverick who was willing to cross party lines on a range of issues.

In July last year, just after his diagnosis, he took part in a late-night Senate session and gave the deciding vote - with a thumbs-down gesture - against partially repealing the contentious Obamacare healthcare law. The move reportedly infuriated Mr Trump.

Mr McCain also criticised President Trump's hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigration and his attacks on the media.

McCain fought hard to the very end

By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter

John McCain was born on the eve of World War II, at the dawn of the ""American Century"" - a time when the US was at the peak of its political, military and cultural power. He dies at what could be considered that age's twilight, as the nation turns inward and contemplates walls, literal and metaphorical, to insulate itself from the rest of this world.

The life of the senator from Arizona marked the arc of this journey.

He suffered, as the nation suffered, from the morass of Vietnam.

As a young politician he was tempted by the lure of power and money, caught up in an influence-peddling scandal that nearly cost him his career.

In his first run for president in 2000, he capitalised on an anti-establishment sentiment and longing for authenticity that would later come to crest with Donald Trump's election. In 2008, he won the Republican nomination, only to see his hopes dashed by the phenomenon that was Barack Obama and a crumbling US economy.

McCain never won the top political office for which he longed. Throughout his life, however, he offered a full-throated defence of an America that was active and engaged in the world. In his final years he sparred with Mr Trump over the direction of the Republican Party and the principles it should embrace.

It's an open question as to whether these views have a future in his party. McCain, however, fought for what he believed was right until the very end. Agree with him or not, that is undeniably a most appropriate epitaph.

Tributes began to pour in for Mr McCain as soon as the news of his death was announced.

Former President George W Bush described Mr McCain as ""a patriot of the highest order"", adding: ""He was a public servant in the finest traditions of our country. And to me, he was a friend whom I'll deeply miss.""

Sarah Palin, who was Mr McCain's running mate during his 2008 bid for president, said the world had lost ""an American original"", sharing a picture of herself with the man she called her friend.

Donald Trump, whom Mr McCain has strongly criticised, tweeted his ""deepest sympathies"" to Mr McCain's family but made no comment about his life.

Sources quoted by US media said President Trump would not be invited to the funeral and the current administration would probably be represented by Vice-President Mike Pence.

Tributes were also paid from the other side of the political spectrum.

Barack Obama, the Democrat who beat Mr McCain to the presidency, said despite their differences, they shared ""a fidelity to something higher - the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants alike have fought, marched and sacrificed.

""Few of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did,"" Mr Obama said. ""But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own.

""At John's best, he showed us what that means.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption Barack Obama, who ran against Mr McCain in 2008, was among the first to pay tribute

Former vice-president, long-time friend and political opponent Joe Biden said Mr McCain's ""impact on America hasn't ended"".

""John McCain's life is proof that some truths are timeless,"" he said in a statement. ""Character. Courage. Integrity.

""A life lived embodying those truths casts a long, long shadow. John McCain will cast a long shadow.""",https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45312217,"['Strongly Republican', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Republican']","['1', '1', '3', '1', '3']"
3URJ6VVYUQ5J0G8R90FF26ZBDHZ4OU,Asians Now Have The Largest Income Gap In America,"Quyen Dinh's parents fled Vietnam for the U.S. in 1981, six years after the fall of Saigon. She was born a year later in California and grew up living in Section 8 housing and relying on food stamps with her family.

Their lives reflect a notable part of the Asian experience in the U.S. -- the too-often overlooked people who didn't soar to the top of the income charts.

Economic inequality among Asian-Americans is now greater than that of other large racial or ethnic groups in the U.S., according to a new report from the Pew Research Center. While Asians overall still have the highest median income, researchers found there is a huge gap within the Asian community -- between those in the top 10 percent and those in the bottom 10 percent.

The study looked at incomes from 1970 to 2016. At the beginning of that period, Asian-Americans had the smallest gap and black Americans had the largest.

""Asians are often pictured as the highest achieving group in America, but Asians are actually the most economically divided or diverse group,"" Pew senior researcher Rakesh Kochhar told HuffPost.

Researchers attributed the growing gap largely to shifts in Asian immigration. The study highlighted two very different waves of migration: the immigrants who came after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 made it easier for Asians to settle in the U.S., joined by the refugees who arrived after the Vietnam War ended, versus the highly skilled job seekers who came more recently under the H-1B visa program.

Kochhar suggested the economic divide mainly increased ""this decade -- the last five to 10 years.""

According to the Pew study, Asians in the top percentile had a median income of $133,529 in 2016, compared with $12,478 for those in the bottom percentile. The gains for lower-income Asians over the study period trailed well behind the gains for their counterparts in other ethnic groups, Pew reported.

Dinh -- who is now executive director at the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, a national advocacy group for Cambodian, Laotian and Vietnamese Americans -- sees in the report a chance to get more help for those who are struggling economically.

""The opportunity that's revealed is that policies from health to housing also need to take into account Asian-American communities,"" she said, adding that low-income Asians have not always been ""on the radar of policymakers.""

When Dinh's family arrived as refugees, her father went to work in the air conditioning industry and her mother was employed in retail. Like many other immigrants, they lived in a low-income community with opportunities for low-skilled jobs. Her family is now lower- to middle-class, she said, but not everyone in that post-war generation has done as well. Nearly 1 in 5 Cambodian families in the U.S., for example, live in poverty.

You never get out of the cycle completely. What we've seen from research is it takes multiple generations to move out of poverty. Quyen Dinh

Immigrants accounted for 81 percent of the growth in the Asian adult population during the period of the Pew report. And now there's an aging population who never held jobs that would provide Social Security benefits. According to Dinh and other immigration experts, these factors can keep families in poverty across generations.

The poorest Asian groups in the U.S. are the Hmong, Malaysians, Burmese and Bhutanese, whose poverty rates hover between 28 and 33 percent -- compared to 15 percent for the general U.S. population.

""That is what generational poverty looks like. You never get out of the cycle completely. What we've seen from research is it takes multiple generations to move out of poverty,"" Dinh said. She hopes the report will push policymakers to focus on ways ""to really disrupt the cycle of poverty.""

The Pew study revealed some other less surprising facts: Whites and Hispanics had the lowest levels of income inequality in 2016, and whites and Asians still out-earn blacks and Hispanics at all income levels.

But it's the people who may be stuck at the lower end of the gap that concern Dinh and other Asian-American advocates.

One problem for lower-income Asians is that service agencies are not always aware of them.

""Unless you do the type of research that Pew did with this and look at different segments of the community on their own, the aggregate numbers do look good for Asian-Americans,"" said Josh Ishimatsu, deputy director of community impact for the National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development. ""This is a population where the median income has been rising. But that's driven by the success of only one segment.""

Language barriers can present another difficulty, Dinh pointed out.

""Often because communities have such limited English capacity, there's really a lack of knowledge about housing, employment, food stamps,"" she said.

Fifteen percent of immigrants from South and East Asia haven't even graduated from high school, compared to 9 percent of native-born Americans.

Ishimatsu called for more data and more support, including from all those higher-income Asian-Americans.

""I'd like to see more disaggregation of AAPI [Asian American Pacific Islander] data and more attention to the most vulnerable in our communities,"" he said. ""I'd like to see more resources directed toward these segments of our communities, whether it's from the public sector or a charitable source, and also from the most well-off in our communities.""

Even some Asian-Americans buy into the model minority myth, Ishimatsu said.

""A lot of Asian-Americans don't know there are Asian-Americans who are less well off, too. It's not just the mainstream public who doesn't know.""

Those words are very close to the sentiment of President Abraham Lincoln, who after the Civil War said of the Southern combatants: â€œDo I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?â€

If restaurant owner Stephanie Wilkinson so disagreed with White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, the Trump administration and all Cabinet members so strongly, why didnâ€™t she see Sanders' presence in her restaurant as a gift from God to try to transform an enemy into a friend?

This is how it could have gone:

Wilkinson: ""Ms. Sanders, I so do not agree with your boss's position on this immigration issue. I would like to have a conversation with you, if I may, so you can understand my position and I can understand yours. By the way, try the braised leg of lamb, it's a house specialty.""

Maybe a conversation something like this would have done more good in changing policy. And we probably never would have heard about the encounter.

You see, the Golden Rule is so much more difficult than it sounds: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.""

These are the words and wisdom of Jesus when confronted by the Pharisees and Sadducees about which of God's commandments is the most important. They were trying to trap Jesus. What is often forgotten or ignored is that Jesus first says that the most important law is to love God with all our heart, mind, soul, and strength â€“ and the other is to love others as ourselves.

These two together constitute the whole of the law. Jesus understood that we humans have a problem with what the prophets summed up as â€œdisordered loves.â€ We love earthly things far more than is healthy, and we love God far less than would benefit us. Only by loving God can we love our neighbor properly. The ""Golden Rule"" can be our march to true peace.

Many religions embrace similar sentiments. Author Abdu Murray brings this up in his book, ""Saving Truth."" Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Unitarian Humanism all have a similar philosophy stated in their doctrines.

Murray says although there are important differences in their wording, ""it's important to see that all these versions express the common belief that we should demonstrate the value and dignity of other humans by our actions.""

And that's the crucial part â€“ ""actions."" It's easy to state a philosophy, write it on a chalk board, on a greeting card, or in an email. But it's much harder to live it out. When we're actually confronted face to face with an ""enemy,"" making that person a friend first requires we forgive him or her. That's costly. It cost the founder of Christianity his life.

And for the record, the same goes for Martin Luther King and Abraham Lincoln. By the same token, forgiving people who we deem have harmed us is the equivalent to self-imposed suffering. Because while everything in us demands an angry and wrathful response, forgiveness requires the exact opposite â€“ and that hurts.

It means I can't shout them down, I can't demean them, and I canâ€™t make them feel embarrassed, or guilty, or ashamed. I must treat them with the respect due to a person just like me, made in the image of God.

The Golden Rule indeed has the power to transform an enemy into a friend, but it's a powerful tool that disarms all participants involved.",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/06/27/red-hen-sarah-huckabee-sanders-and-golden-rule.html,"['Republican', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Republican', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['3', '1', '1', '1', '1']"

The three officials who navigated the United States through the worst financial crisis since the Great Recession warn that policymakers may be forgetting some of the lessons they learned the hard way 10 years ago.

That could make it tougher to manage the next economic crisis.

Former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke and former Treasury secretaries Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner shared leadership of key institutions during the banking and housing meltdown in 2008 that threatened to bring down the global economic system. A decade later, the three men gathered with a dozen reporters at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., to discuss the reforms enacted in its wake and the ability of the United States today to prevent some new crisis from exacting the financial and human toll that one did.

Some things are clearly better, they said, including tighter federal banking regulations that have set higher standards for liquidity and provided emergency powers for the government to intervene in a crisis. But they agreed that the federal budget deficit, exacerbated by last year's tax-cut bill, will make it harder for the government to respond when the economy inevitably takes a downturn.

'Better defenses, weaker arsenal'

""Better defenses, weaker arsenal,"" said Geithner, who was president of the New York Fed when the crisis began and then became President Barack Obama's first Treasury secretary.

They also worried whether the nation's current state of constant political warfare would allow the sort of bipartisan action that rescued the U.S. economy then, albeit with some bumps, and at a cost.

""The crisis brought out some of the very worst in the American system in terms of our dysfunction, the political functions, the problems with our regulatory system and so on, but at the end, it really brought people together,"" said Paulson, who was George W. Bush's Treasury secretary when the crisis struck.

""I wouldn't want to dismiss the possibility as an American that if we had another crisis that we couldn't come together,"" he said, not exactly describing that prospect as a sure thing. It was hard then, and it likely would be harder now.

â€œWe're choosing to live with a situation in which things have to get terrible before it becomes politically viable for Congress to legislate the classic set of tools that all countries need to save their economies from panics and depressions.â€ Timothy Geithner

""We're choosing to live with a situation in which things have to get terrible before it becomes politically viable for Congress to legislate the classic set of tools that all countries need to save their economies from panics and depression,"" Geithner said. ""We have a system where it has to get really scary and bad for you to be more optimistic about the chance to legislate the mix of Keynesian things and emergency powers necessary.""

Federal Reserve officials have recently been criticized by Democrats for proposals to ease bank capital requirements and for lowering the bar on the stress tests that are designed to ensure banks have enough in reserve in a financial crisis.

Preventing Armageddon

The signs of trouble in the economy began in 2007 and weren't under control until well into 2009, Bernanke recalled. But it was during August, September and October of 2008 â€“ 10 years ago â€“ that the most dramatic events occurred and decisions were made. They included the seismic announcement in September 2008 that the financial services firm Lehman Brothers was filing for bankruptcy.

The three men make an odd trio: The professorial Bernanke, now 64, a scholar of the Great Depression, appointed to chair the Fed first by President George W. Bush and then by Obama. The ebullient Paulson, 72, a former chairman of Goldman Sachs and a Republican. And the wiry Geithner, 56, a Democrat. But they have the camaraderie of veterans who fought a war together and survived.

""What we were trying to do was to prevent Armageddon,"" Paulson said. ""We were looking at a situation where if we felt we had one more big institution go down, it would have taken the whole system down."" As they scrambled to respond, ""we were focused on staving off disaster.""

That stands in sharp contrast with today's upbeat economic news. The unemployment rate has dropped to historic lows, now 4 percent. The Federal Reserve in a report last Friday called the financial system ""substantially more resilient than during the decades before the financial crisis.""

Another downturn

But the veterans of the 2008 crisis note that sooner or later, there will be another economic downturn. And they caution that some of the long-term economic trends that contributed to the last one haven't been effectively addressed.

""Today, when we are growing, this is the time when we need to deal with some of the persistent structural issues that are going to determine our long-term economic competitiveness,"" Paulson said. ""We have the fiscal deficit, dealing with immigration, the income disparity and what automation and globalization are doing to wages. They need to deal with all those.""

U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson speaks to the media on Sept. 29, 2008 at the White House in Washington, DC. (Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)

The financial crisis the United States is most certain to face is one over the deficit, he said. ""It will slowly strangle us,"" he said, undercutting the nation's ability to fund entitlement programs and to invest in programs that boost the next generation. ""It will squeeze out all sorts of things we need to do.""

â€œYou asked about the deficit. If we don't act, that is the most certain fiscal or economic crisis we will have. It will be slow. It will slowly strangle us.â€ Henry Paulson

Deficit threat

That said, neither Republicans nor Democrats are now focused on the deficit as a priority. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the annual deficit will top $1 trillion in 2020 and the national debt will reach more than $33 trillion in 2028. At that point, the debt will nearly match the size of the overall economy, the highest level since just after World War II and one that risks driving up interest rates and slowing down the economy.

It also would make it more difficult for officials to approve new spending to help the economy pull out of the next recession.

""I think the deficit fever of '09 through '13 was mistimed,"" Geithner said, reducing the amount of stimulus spending that might have helped turn around the economy faster. ""I say the new complacency about the larger deficits is mistimed, too.""

Among other concerns:

Emergency powers: Restrictions on some of the powers they used in the wake of the Great Recession create ""some concern,"" Bernanke said. ""It's important we don't backslide any further on those powers."" The 2010 Dodd-Frank law put some limits on the Fed's emergency lending powers and on FDIC bank-loan guarantees.

""We ran the financials of the United States for a long period of time with very weak and very limited protection for the consumer. You get tragic results from that.""

34HEO7RUG7C1ZIGOAT6A94QGG52RA6,"Central America battles corruption, violence despite billions in US aid","U.S. foreign policy in Central America has long been a considered a two-way street. America provides aid to promote stability, economic progress and reduce violence. In return, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador are supposed to reduce illegal immigration.

Last week, President Trump suggested that America isn't getting what it paid for: ""When countries abuse us by sending their people up, not their best people, we are not going to give any more aid to those countries. Why the hell should we? Why should we?""

As a fresh wave of refugees from the so-called North Triangle reaches the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump isn't the only one asking if Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are keeping their end of the bargain.

""The violence is bad, the conditions horrible, but at the same time it is not the responsibility of the U.S.A. to solve all the problems of other countries,"" says Ana Quintana, executive director of the Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies.

Over the past decade, U.S. taxpayers have provided $1.5 billion in aid to El Salvador, $1.4 billion to Guatemala and $1.1 billion to Honduras, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

Yet according to the thousands of migrants seeking asylum in the U.S., all three countries remain mired in poverty and beset by gang and drug violence. Corruption, they say, has never been worse.

""In Honduras we just can't live anymore because of the gang,"" says Mirna Ruiz, who has fled her home nation and is currently in Tijuana. ""We can't even go shopping because we are afraid.""

Vice President Pence met with leaders of all three nations Thursday in Guatemala and told them the U.S. expects to see them do more to control their own borders. And while President Trump proposed cutting their aid in next year's budget, many Democrats think thatâ€™s a mistake.

""We are working on infrastructure in the Northern Triangle,"" Rep. Norma Torres, D-Calif., told reporters last week at an immigrant detention center outside of San Diego. ""Let's continue that policy, letâ€™s continue to help them in their own country.""

Addressing the root causes of illegal immigration is a long-term proposition. Advocates say it would cost more in the long run to abandon Central America now.

Others argue it's time to demand more accountability. Historically foreign aid budgets have passed through Congress with little debate. Congressional committees rubber-stamped State Department requests, and the gravy train continued.

Immigration from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala increased by 25 percent between 2007 and 2015, compared to just a six percent increase in arrivals from Mexico, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census data. In 2011, 42,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended from those three countries combined. Last year, the number of apprehensions had skyrocketed to 163,000 â€” 50,000 more than apprehensions of people from Mexico.

And while these immigrants tell Border Patrol agents and asylum officers they are being persecuted at home, surveys of recently deported immigrants from those countries admit 95 percent went to the U.S. for work, not because of violence.

""The United States is not and should not be in a position to be complacent and accept countries who are not fulfilling their obligations,"" says Quintana. ""Until there is a serious focus by the administration, a serious focus by Congress to really delve into this we are not going to see the crisis at the border stop.""",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/28/central-america-battles-corruption-violence-despite-billions-in-us-aid.html,"['Strongly Republican', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Republican', 'Neutral']","['5', '3', '4', '5', '5']"

US Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy is to retire, giving President Donald Trump the chance to cement a conservative majority on the top court.

The conservative has sided with liberals on many decisions, including the 5-4 rulings that decided same-sex marriage and upheld abortion rights.

In his letter to Mr Trump, Justice Kennedy expressed ""profound gratitude"" for having served in the highest court.

The 81-year-old judge will retire on 31 July, he said in his letter.

He is the second-oldest justice on the nine-member US Supreme Court.

The court plays a key role in American life and is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions.

In recent years, it has expanded gay marriage to all 50 states, halted President Barack Obama's immigration orders and delayed a US plan to cut carbon emissions while appeals went forward.

Earlier this week it upheld Mr Trump's travel ban which covers people from several Muslim-majority countries, in a 5-4 conservative majority ruling.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said on Wednesday that a vote on Mr Trump's nominee to replace Justice Kennedy - who earned a reputation as the court's ""swing"" vote - would take place by the autumn.

Justice Kennedy has frequently sided with abortion rights advocates in the court and news of his retirement has raised fears among pro-choice groups that access to legal abortions in several states could be under threat.

Justice Kennedy said he was retiring because he wanted to spend more time with his family.

Who is Anthony Kennedy?

Justice Kennedy, who was raised in California, was nominated by President Ronald Reagan and began his term in 1988.

He voted conservative on issues of campaign finance, voting rights and gun rights but was considered a swing vote on key rulings.

Justice Kennedy penned the Supreme Court's first major gay-rights decision in 1996, protecting LGBT Americans from discrimination.

In 2015, he authored the landmark opinion which gave LGBT citizens the right to marry, writing: ""They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law and the Constitution grants them that right.""

As a justice, he routinely favoured personal liberty and the limiting of federal power.

Mr Trump said Justice Kennedy had ""displayed great vision"" and ""tremendous heart"".

Timing is everything

Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Without Anthony Kennedy, the political centre on the Supreme Court will be firmly on the right. Whoever Donald Trump nominates - and he's promised to draw from the same list of candidates from which he picked Neil Gorsuch - will be a person with solid conservative bona fides.

Democrats and liberal activists will howl, rage and do all they can to slow the process, but the timing of Mr Kennedy's retirement makes what happens next all but inevitable. The president will surely offer his choice quickly, and if Republican senators stick together they have the votes to confirm before November's mid-terms congressional elections, let alone when new senators are sworn in next January.

And even if the court vacancy becomes a campaign issue, the open seat in 2016 proved that court vacancies are a much stronger motivating consideration for Republicans - particularly evangelical voters - than they are for Democrats.

File this as yet another entry in the ""elections have consequences"" scrapbook.

If Hillary Clinton had prevailed in 2016, Democrats would be contemplating a 6-3 liberal Supreme Court majority and an opportunity to reshape the legal landscape for a generation. Instead, on subjects like abortion law and gay rights, the pendulum is swinging the other direction.

What's the reaction?

During a meeting with Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa at the White House, President Trump said he would select a nominee to replace Justice Kennedy from a list of 25 potential court candidates that his campaign had compiled during the election.

Mr Trump said the process to replace him would begin immediately.

""Hopefully we will pick someone who is just as outstanding"", he said.

Mr Trump added that he had learned of the judge's retirement about a half hour before, when Justice Kennedy came to the White House to meet him.

The White House also released a statement thanking Justice Kennedy for his 30 years of service as a ""tireless voice for individual rights"".

""His words have left an indelible mark not only on this generation, but on the fabric of American history.""

Top Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a televised speech on the floor of the Senate that Justice Kennedy's replacement would be a decision affecting ""generations"".

""Our Republican colleagues in the senate should follow the rule they set in 2016, not to consider a Supreme Court Justice in an election year,"" Senator Schumer said.

""Anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy.""

3ZZAYRN1I793H1NHO1GNAEB3T40TOB,Fox News' Ingraham loves America less the more brown people it has,"Fox News commentator Laura Ingraham saysâ€”with shots of immigrant farm workers airing over her shoulderâ€”that immigration has made America unworthy of our love:

In some parts of the country, it does seem like the America that we know and love doesn't exist anymore. Massive demographic changes have been foisted on the American people, and they are changes that none of us ever voted for, and most of us don't like. From Virginia to California we see stark examples of how radically in some ways the country has changed. Now, much of this is related to both illegal and in some cases legal immigration that, of course, progressives love.

America: If it ainâ€™t white, itâ€™s wrong. As someone who remembers being told â€œAmerica, love it or leave itâ€ during the Cold War (seriously, on the playground in elementary school), I find Ingrahamâ€™s sentiment both laughable and completely understandable. Now itâ€™s â€œyouâ€™re making me love America less (because Iâ€™m racist), so you have to leave.â€ The right always thinks they have the right to define what this country is and isnâ€™t, even against reality.

As for that whole â€œmost of us donâ€™t likeâ€ it bit, Conor Friedersdorf has receipts:

Lest anyone worry that America wonâ€™t have enough patriots left, Ingraham is thankfully wrong when she implies that â€œmost of usâ€ feel as she does: The survey by Pew Research Center, conducted June 5 through 12 among 2,002 adults, finds that 38% say legal immigration into the United States should be kept at its present level, while 32% say it should be increased and 24% say it should be decreased. Since 2001, the share of Americans who favor increased legal immigration into the U.S. has risen 22 percentage points (from 10% to 32%), while the share who support a decrease has declined 29 points (from 53% to 24%).

But if the â€œusâ€ in Ingrahamâ€™s â€œmost of usâ€ is Fox News viewers â€¦ well, sheâ€™s probably right in that case. Itâ€™s just that, again, as it turns out they donâ€™t get to define all things to all people.",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2018/8/9/1787046/-Fox-News-Ingraham-loves-America-less-the-more-brown-people-it-has#comments,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Republican', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['4', '3', '5', '5', '1']"
3A520CCNWOICQEBJONMAAXRX1PPAE7,Elizabeth Warren Plays to Far Left Base in Senate Confirmation Hearing,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) turned Thursdayâ€™s Senate confirmation hearings on Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) nominee Kathy Kraninger political.

The Trump administration provided Warren with this opportunity for hypocritical moral preening by nominating a candidate for the position who has no experience in banking or consumer finance regulation, but does have extensive experience as a mid-level official in the Department of Homeland Security, and currently serves as associate director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

Mick Mulvaney, the director of the OMB, where he is Kraningerâ€™s boss, has also served as acting director of the CFPB, given that temporary appointment in November when former director Richard Cordray, a protegÃ© and ally of Elizabeth Warren, resigned to run for governor of Ohio. Cordray is now the Democrat nominee for that office in this Novemberâ€™s election.

â€œIt is a moral stain that will follow you for the rest of your life. If you are given a big promotion it will be a stain on the Senators who do it,â€ Warren told Kraninger during the bitterly partisan hearing, referencing the Trump administrationâ€™s policy of separating children from accompanying adults who cross the border together illegally.

â€œIt is not appropriate to give my opinion,â€ Kraninger responded when Warren asked her for her opinion about the Trump administrationâ€™s border and immigration policy.

C-SPAN provided a seven minute video of Warrenâ€™s questioning of Kraninger at the hearing in this tweet:

.@SenWarren asks @CFPB Nominee about her role &amp; thoughts about Trump administrationâ€™s child separation policy. Warren concludes exchange â€œIt is fundamentally immoral and you â€“ you were part of it, Ms. Kraninger. It is a moral stain that will follow you for the rest of your life.â€ pic.twitter.com/tZlegMi3je â€” CSPAN (@cspan) July 19, 2018

Warren, who advanced her own professional career by making false claims of Native American ancestry, demonstrated her lack of seriousness and political posturing by leading with this line of inquiry, because it has nothing to do with Kraningerâ€™s qualifications to head the CFPB, an agency which Warrenâ€™s academic research was the basis for establishing.

Gavin Clarkson, a Harvard Law School graduate and a citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, criticized Warren after the hearing ended because â€œshe ignored the role that the CFPB she personally designed and constructed has played in eliminating economic development opportunities for tribes, and keeping people â€˜on the resâ€™ impoverished,â€ in her questions of Kraninger.

â€œAt todayâ€™s confirmation hearing, Sen. Warren had an opportunity to stick up for Native Americansâ€” something she supposedly wants to do with all her â€˜Iâ€™m leaning into the Pocahontas attackâ€™,â€ Clarkson, a former president of the Native American Law Students Association, said.

Clarkson, who is the Republican nominee for Secretary of State in New Mexico, said:

To her credit, Ms. Kraninger did note that it would be â€˜helpfulâ€™ for â€˜struggling Americansâ€™ to have more competition in the small dollar lending space, a need that tribes can and already are helping to fulfill, even if the CFPB under Richard Cordray did virtually everything in its power to prevent them from doing so, and keep Native Americans out of the financial services space and socio-economically marginalized. This, along with supporting more energy development on tribal lands, is another meaningful way in which, if Ms. Kraninger is confirmed, the Trump administration will help to lift up Native American communities instead of keeping them stuck in what is now centuries of poverty and de facto isolation, much of which has occurred thanks to Democratic policies that Sen. Warren and her fellow partisans have supported,

Before the hearings, Victoria Finkle, writing at the Bankshot column of the American Banker, identified â€œthree of the most important questions [Kraninger] will face.â€

Are you qualified to oversee this agency despite a lack of financial services or consumer finance experience? Can you explain your involvement in the White Houseâ€™s â€œzero-toleranceâ€ policy? Whatâ€™s the appropriate role for government when it comes to consumer protection?

J.W. Verret, Associate Professor of Law (teaching Law and Accounting, Corporate, Securities &amp; Banking Law) at George Mason Universityâ€™s Antonin Scalia Law School, and a critic of the selection of Kraninger as the nominee to head the CFPB, offered this assessment to Breitbart News of her performance at Thursdayâ€™s hearings.

â€œThe nominee demonstrated skill in the Washington game of short sound bites and deflection,â€ Verret told Breitbart News in an emailed statement.

â€œThe nominee demonstrated no working knowledge of consumer protection issues. Nor did the nominee show any appreciation for the fight for consumer access to credit products that many of us fought for over a decade. I remain concerned about the nomineeâ€™s lack of experience,â€ he concluded.

Earlier in the hearing, Kraninger gave her boss at the OMB, who also serves as acting director of the CFPB, a thumbs up for the job he has done at the agency his appointment in November, as the Associated Press reported, â€œIn response to a question from Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana, Kraninger said â€œI would say yesâ€ when asked whether she approves of Mulvaneyâ€™s work at the bureau.

In advance of Thursdayâ€™s hearing, The Washington Post reported:

In her first public statements since being nominated by President Trump to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Kathy Kraninger on Thursday offered lawmakers broad assurances that the bureau would be â€œfair and transparentâ€ under her leadership â€” but will give few specifics, according to prepared testimony. As director of the watchdog agency, Kraninger told the Senate Banking Committee, she would work closely with other regulators to go after fraudsters and use cost-benefit analysis when considering new rules. But she dodged questions from lawmakers on some of the most of the controversial issues facing the agency, including whether it should roll back regulations on payday lenders. â€œWhile I will not prejudge and cannot predict every decision that will come before me as director, if confirmed, I can assure you that I will focus solely on serving the American people,â€ Kraninger said.

Auto Finance News reported,â€todayâ€™s Senate hearing provided a slight glimpse into her views on rulemaking and how she would apply it to the auto finance space.â€

Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) used his time to ask Kraninger about former director Richard Cordrayâ€™s use of guidance to affect change in the auto finance industry. â€œUnder the previous regime the CFPB engaged in imposing policies that had the effect of being a rule without going through the Administrative Procedures Act,â€ Toomey said during the hearing. â€œThe indirect auto lending case was such a case where the guidance was the mechanism they used to impose what should have gone through the rulemaking process, never did, Congress recognized that and had such repealed it. Will you commit to using the administrative procedures act when enacting new rules?â€ Kraninger responded, â€œYes, itâ€™s critical for the process.â€ Kraninger gave minimal color to her answers and often refused to give her opinion on pressing issues facing the bureau, yet she did give yes or no responses to various topics.

The far left and the entire Democrat Party is united in their opposition to Kraningerâ€™s nomination, based on the expectation that should she be confirmed to a five year term as CFPB director, she will continue to implement the Trump agenda in the manner her current boss, Mick Mulvaney, has done since he took over the reins there in November.

Kraningerâ€™s answers today gave Democrats no reason to believe that she would diverge from the Trump/Mulvaney agenda should she be confirmed at CFPB, but they also gave little comfort to critics who say her lack of experience or track record in consumer finance or banking regulation provide no indication as to how she will manage the agency as director, where she is accountable to no one, be they President Trump or Mick Mulvaney.",https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/07/19/elizabeth-warren-plays-to-far-left-base-in-senate-confirmation-hearing-for-kathy-kraninger/,"['Republican', 'Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Republican', 'Neutral']","['4', '1', '2', '1', '3']"

The lawyer, Andrea Martinez, told the Kansas City Star that the altercation outside ICEâ€™s Enforcement and Removal Operations office in Kansas City left her with a fractured right foot, and a bloodied left ankle and knee. She added that the agent physically separated the boy, Noah, from her, the report said.

ICE released a statement to FOX 4, saying it takes the allegations â€œvery seriouslyâ€ and was looking into the matter.

Noah was previously separated from his mother, Kenia Bautistia-Mayorga, 23, while she spent more than a month in Platte County Jail in Missouri. Bautistia-Mayorga, an undocumented immigrant, is currently six months pregnant, according to the Star.

The babyâ€™s father, Luis Alfredo Diaz Inestroza, also an undocumented immigrant from Honduras, looked after the boy while the mother was in jail.

On Tuesday, the father accompanied Noah to say goodbye before the mother and child were deported, but his status made him a target for detainment, Martinez told the Star. She said the ICE agent pulled the father and Noah inside the center office while she waited outside.

A few minutes later, she said she was allowed in the building. She said Noah and his mother were crying and hugging. The father was detained and sent to a central Missouri jail, where he was being held without bond.

Bautisa-Mayorga was reportedly taken into custody in February 2016 for illegally crossing the Texas border. A judge released her on her own recognizance but she did not attend the hearing.

Since then, Bautisa-Mayorga and her son have been living with Inestroza in Texas. They were detained after an officer pulled them over in May. Inestroza was told he had two months to leave the country.",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/06/28/immigration-lawyer-trying-to-reunite-mother-child-claims-ice-agent-shoved-her.html,"['Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['5', '4', '1', '5', '5']"
32L724R85M2VTNJ79PUYL7EKSSHIP1,"With Janus, the Court Deals Unions a Crushing Blow. Now What? - The New York Times","Yet what is often lost in the conversation around organized labor is that the entire idea behind organizing is that working people are their own best champions. The union is not supposed to be the third party that you call when your boss is being a jerk. The union is what happens when you and your colleagues get together and refuse to work until that boss is gone. Or, in the case of West Virginia, Arizona and Oklahoma teachers, until the state decides to put some money where its never-ending paeans to education are.

Laborâ€™s strategy for a while has been to spend heavily on elections, often in service of any Democrat on the ballot; it doubled down on Hillary Clinton in 2016 to little benefit. Bernie Sanders, who did without most unionsâ€™ endorsements (the Communications Workers of America and National Nurses United being notable exceptions), has introduced a bill in the Senate that would push labor law dramatically back in the workersâ€™ direction, including by making fair-share fees a requirement, and a range of prominent Democrats have signed on as co-sponsors. But even such a bill will do only so much to revive the labor movement.

â€œAfter decades of demobilization, many unions have become legalistic, service-focused organizations that overly rely on paid staff to lobby elected officials,â€ Chris Brooks of the labor organization and publication Labor Notes pointed out. â€œThe results speak for themselves. Few if any pro-union laws have resulted, even in blue states.â€

There are some signs that labor is thinking about getting tougher on Democrats, or at least thinking about the newly tightened purse strings and where best to spend. Mary Kay Henry of the Service Employees International Union, in a recent interview on the Laura Flanders show, said that S.E.I.U. would be endorsing candidates from now on who were committed to a $15 minimum wage and making unionizing easier, to protecting the Affordable Care Act and supporting Medicare for All, and supporting what she termed common-sense immigration reform.

But no candidate has electrified working people from coast to coast the way a wave of teacher strikes did, and though they sprang from weak unions with their backs to the wall, the labor movement can in fact think strategically about how to build and wield its power through what Ms. Henry appropriately called â€œdisruption.â€ The court has decided that labor peace will no longer be traded for fees; labor can look to West Virginia for an example of what the end of labor peace looks like.

As Jane McAlevey, a labor organizer and the author of â€œNo Shortcuts,â€ argues, health care and education workers in particular â€” but also public employees in general â€” have a distinct ability to bring the community together around their demands. They have relationships with the people they serve every day, relationships built on trust and commonality that can build power in the near term â€” rather than simply hunker down, take the hit and think about the next election.

The corporate class isnâ€™t going to wait until November â€” it is acting now, and its allies on the Supreme Court have dealt labor another body blow. But this is the wrong time for labor to wait, to get hesitant and timid. Union budgets will no doubt take a wallop.

But the recent strike wave has reminded us that unions win more when they bargain with politicians from a place of strength. And the power that unions have â€” the power they have always had â€” is in people, not in dollars spent.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/opinion/supreme-court-janus-unions.html,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral']","['1', '1', '1', '2', '2']"
3WRBLBQ2GSQE9F9S2GF5LU0W5JS0GN,Koch-backed political group unveils House endorsements,"The political network created by the billionaire Koch brothers announced plans to support eight House Republicans on Thursday, pledging financial resources and activists to help re-elect several vulnerable congressmen deemed ""principled"" conservatives.

The first wave of endorsements includes a handful of sometime-critics of President Trump, particularly on immigration and spending.

The announcement comes a month after Mr. Trump assailed the Koch brothers as ""a total joke in real Republican circles."" Days earlier, network patriarch Charles Koch had condemned the increased government spending under the Republican president's leadership and Mr. Trump's push for import tariffs. The Koch brothers have also been critical of Mr. Trump's protectionist trade measures. In July, Tim Phillips, president of the Koch-backed group Americans for Prosperity, told CBSN that the aluminum and steel tariffs implemented by the Trump administration were ""misguided.""

Despite clashes with the White House, the Koch network remains one of the most powerful political organizations in the country. The sprawling organization is on pace to spend as much as $400 million on politics and policy ahead of November's election. And its coalition of trained activists across 36 states has no rival.

The candidates backed by the network's political arm, Americans for Prosperity, include eight men from seven states: Reps. Rod Blum and David Young of Iowa, Dave Brat of Virginia, Ted Budd of North Carolina, Steve Chabot of Ohio, Will Hurd of Texas, Erik Paulsen of Minnesota and Peter Roskam of Illinois. Brat, Roskam and Hurd in particular are facing serious challenges in November, and are vulnerable to being defeated by their Democratic opponents.

For each of the candidates, Americans for Prosperity ""will fully activate its grass-roots infrastructure through phone banks and neighborhood canvassing, as well as deploy targeted digital, mail and radio advertising,"" according to a statement.

Absent from the list are some of the nation's most vulnerable House Republicans including Reps. Barbara Comstock of Virginia and Mike Coffman of Colorado in addition to any Republicans from top House battleground states such as California, New Jersey or New York.

The Kochs, who devote substantial resources to pushing conservative policies at the state and national level, are active in New Jersey but do not have chapters in California or New York.

""While Americans for Prosperity is committed to opposing politicians who actively work to defeat good policies, we are proud to stand with lawmakers who champion legislation that helps improve people's lives,"" said Phillips.

He added: ""The candidates we are supporting this fall have each been strong, principled leaders.""

All but one of the endorsed candidates, Hurd, supported efforts to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law, including the popular provision that required insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions. Hurd is a moderate Republican from Texas, differing ideologically from some of the other candidates backed by the Kochs.

All of them voted for the sweeping tax cuts and the GOP plan to ease banking regulations put in place after the 2007 financial collapse.

Most supported the White House-backed $1.3 trillion spending bill Congress adopted earlier in the year over the Koch network's objections. The opponents included three people on the endorsement list: Freedom Caucus members Blum, Brat and Budd.

Some of the group also oppose Mr. Trump's immigration policies. Hurd, in particular, has emerged as a vocal critic of the administration's move to separate immigrant families at the border and spend tens of billions of dollars on a huge wall. Paulsen supports a law that would protect many young immigrants in the country illegally from deportation, while Roskam opposed Mr. Trump's border separation policy as well.

The Koch network favors a more forgiving immigration policy in line with much of the business wing of the GOP. In April, the Koch network launched an ad campaign to urge for the protection of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients.

""As we work to build progress in Washington, we will continue our pursuit of policy majorities that will move our country in the right direction by supporting leaders like these,"" Phillips said.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/koch-backed-political-group-unveils-house-endorsements/,"['Republican', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Democratic']","['2', '4', '3', '5', '4']"
3D0LPO3EACHZYNMBY73MIV3I86IYO5,"On July Fourth, make your own Declaration of Independence -- From the federal government","This Fourth of July, many Americans are spun up, protesting against President Trump with a long list of grievances â€“ most recently his plans to appoint a conservative justice to the Supreme Court, as well as his immigration policies, his foreign policy, his trade policy, his tweeting â€¦ his everything.

Calls for the presidentâ€™s impeachment grow louder from the self-styled Resistance â€“ increasingly strident folks on the left, some proudly calling themselves socialists â€“ who act as if they are fighting a tyrannical enemy nation occupying the White House. They may have seen one too many films about occupied Europe in World War II.

Trump administration officials are harassed at restaurants, movie theaters and their homes. And donâ€™t forget that just a year ago, a gunman attacked Republican members of Congress at a baseball practice and severely wounded Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., almost taking his life.

Underlying much of this angst and anger is a mistaken belief that the federal government is all that matters. But in reality, this isnâ€™t true.

Let me review what we all should have learned in school. Power is not all concentrated in the hands of our elected president, Congress and the federal courts. Importantly, we have state and local governments that share power as well, all led by people the voters elect.

The Founding Fathers designed our system this way in the Constitution for a very important reason: liberty is elusive in a large land with a diverse population if government power is centralized and monopolized in Washington.

The United States of America made its Declaration of Independence from Britain on July 4, 1776. More than a mere document, the declaration launched the American project, giving our nation this mission statement:

â€œWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. â€” That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.â€

The implementation of â€œunalienable Rightsâ€ for all Americans (black people, women and Native Americans were regrettably excluded for many years) required a horrific Civil War and several amendments to the Constitution to be realized. But our form of government is, at its core, designed to foster â€œLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.â€

Some political matters require a national standard. For instance, after the Supreme Courtâ€™s infamous Dred Scott decision in 1857, essentially upholding the practice of slavery and denying citizenship to black people, Abraham Lincoln observed: â€œA house divided against itself, cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free.â€

Similarly, after the Supreme Courtâ€™s Obergefell decision in 2015 regarding same-sex marriage, there is no going back â€“ contracts must be honored across state lines.

This still leaves an enormous amount of room for Americans to seek their preferred form of government at the state level.

People have rights, states have powers. Among the powers allotted to states are the ability to tax, spend, regulate and set laws for punishing crimes.

If the voters of California and New York want high taxes and big government, they may elect to do so. But if people in Texas and Florida prefer no income tax and smaller government, then that should be fine as well.

More importantly, people in California and New York ought to let their fellow Americans in other states live as they wish. The left-leaning, big-government states shouldnâ€™t seek to wield the power of the national government â€“ including its vast regulatory bureaucracy and the courts â€“ to force other parts of the nation to live like California and New York.

It is the mistaken notion of virtually limitless federal government power that has caused todayâ€™s so-called Resistance to become unhinged. Similarly, the exercise of this crushing federal power provoked the fed-up reaction that boosted voter turnout for Donald Trump in the 2016 election in states that hadnâ€™t voted for a Republican presidential candidate in decades.

It comes back to rights. The founders believed in rights that didnâ€™t require the labor or taxes of others to be fulfilled. We have a right to free speech, to practice of our religion, and to bear arms. We donâ€™t have the right to expect that taxpayer funds will be used to provide us a computer and Internet access, a place to worship, or a rifle.

Similarly, we donâ€™t have a right to free food, free housing, a free college education, free health care, free cars, and more freebies supplied by the government thanks to the labor and hard-earned cash of others.

Getting all these things for free may at first sound like heaven on Earth â€“ a Bernie Sanders utopia. But if this socialist dream ever became reality, it would turn out to be a nightmare. It would send everyoneâ€™s taxes soaring through the roof and create a tremendous disincentive to work â€“ meaning taxes would have to be raised even higher on those people who still held jobs. There would be shortages of just about everything.

Think Iâ€™m exaggerating? Just look at the economic basket cases of Cuba and North Korea today, or the old Soviet Union, China and Eastern European nations in the years before limited free-market reforms took effect. In all these cases, powerful and unchecked central governments set rigid national policies that crippled economies and wiped out personal freedoms.

The genius of the American system is to not leave all governmental power with the federal government. Instead, we allow states to function as laboratories of democracy.

The 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence made it clear that they saw the King of Englandâ€™s far-away rule resulting in â€œa long train of abusesâ€ with the â€œdirect object (being) the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.â€

Todayâ€™s federal government frequently appears to have similar designs, with unelected bureaucrats in Washington setting policy for the whole nation, depriving voters in the states of self-determination through their elected state representatives.

On this Independence Day, let us resolve to turn our attention to our families, our communities, and our states, declaring independence from a distant and often unresponsive federal government.

Our national motto, â€œE pluribus unumâ€ â€“ out of the many, one â€“ speaks to a paradox in this light. By allowing the many states room to formulate their own solutions using the democratic process, we can more readily unify into one America.

We celebrate this all on Independence Day.",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/07/04/on-july-fourth-make-your-own-declaration-independence-from-federal-government.html,"['Strongly Republican', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Republican']","['2', '1', '3', '2', '2']"
3MXX6RQ9EWN1LGKSO0SUR641NMV4PB,Trump to Montenegro: Drop Dead - The New York Times,"He then segued to a claim that he had already â€œraisedâ€ an additional $44 billion from NATO members and there was more to come, followed by a riff on how immigration was â€œdestroying the culture of Europe.â€

The answer to Mr. Carlsonâ€™s and Mr. Trumpâ€™s question on why defend Montenegro from attack is, of course, Article 5 of the NATO treaty, the central tenet that requires every member to come to the aid of any ally under attack. That does not mean NATO would have to pile in if Montenegro aggressively assaulted, say, Serbia, since the article is triggered only if a member is attacked. It has been invoked only once: not in the Balkans, but in support of the United States after 9/11.

The broader question, whether NATO is needed any longer in the post-Communist world, has been extensively debated over the past quarter century and answered in the affirmative, as a model of collective security and as a trans-Atlantic bond. It is clear that Mr. Trump, in his zero-sum view of global forces, knows nothing of this history or debate. A larger question is whether he is aware that his friend Mr. Putin strenuously opposed Montenegroâ€™s joining NATO, and that Russia is suspected of being behind a failed 2016 plot to overthrow its government and assassinate its prime minister.

In any case, the response from Montenegro was, indeed, aggressive. â€œHeâ€™s the strangest president in the history of the United States,â€ Ranko Krivokapic, a former president of the Montenegro Parliament, told the BBC. Reactions at home were less generous. â€œIt is not just that the president throws Montenegro under the bus; he makes the U.S. commitment to NATO conditional and makes clear his discomfort w/Article 5 and collective security, the core of the alliance,â€ tweeted Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, wrote on Twitter, â€œBy attacking Montenegro &amp; questioning our obligations under NATO, the President is playing right into Putinâ€™s hands.â€

Mr. Trump might get his staff to find another missing double negative to roll back what he said. A far better job for his people would be to compel him to understand that petty and uninformed whims from his high office are incomparably more dangerous to Americaâ€™s security, and the worldâ€™s, than to a tiny Balkan country.

Itâ€™s old news that university debts and rocketing housing costs are common concerns for people born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, living in the US, the UK and many other countries. Multiple studies suggest this group will be the first in recorded history to end up poorer than those which came before.

People in their early thirties in Norway have an average annual disposable household income of around 460,000 kroner - around $56,200

But perhaps this doesnâ€™t have to be a foregone conclusion.

In Europeâ€™s northernmost country, things are decidedly different.

Best known for its Viking history, snow sports and jaw-dropping fjords, Norway is making a new name for itself as the only major economy in Europe where young people are getting markedly richer.

People in their early thirties in Norway have an average annual disposable household income of around 460,000 kroner (around $56,200).

Young Norwegians have enjoyed a 13% rise in disposable household income in real terms compared to Generation X (those born between 1966 and 1980) when they were the same age. These startling figures come from the largest comparative wealth data set in the world, the Luxembourg Income Database, and were analysed in a recent report on generational incomes for the UK Think Tank The Resolution Foundation.

Compare this with young people in other strong economies: US millennials have experienced a 5% dip, in Germany itâ€™s a 9% drop. For those living in southern Europe (the southern Eurozone suffered the brunt of the global economic crisis in 2008), disposable incomes have plunged by as much as 30%.

Norwayâ€™s youth unemployment rate (among 15- to 29-year-olds) is also relatively low at 9.4% compared to an OECD average of 13.9%.

â€˜A lucky situationâ€™

On a rare scorching day in the Norwegian capital Oslo, itâ€™s not difficult to find young locals who embody the countryâ€™s good fortunes.

â€œI donâ€™t really think about how I spend my money,â€ says Aleksander Aarnes, a 25-year-old graduate.

â€œI go to the theatre about once a month, go to the cinema once a month. I can go out and eat and drink with friends... I go on vacation (holiday).â€

Aarnes is pursuing a career writing for musical theatre, but is yet to earn anything for his efforts, so he funds his lifestyle by working just one or two shifts a week in a supermarket in Korsvoll, a sleepy suburb dotted with large detached pastel-coloured wooden houses. He shares an apartment with a friend in another suburb about a 20-minute bus ride from the city centre.

â€œIâ€™m really aware of the lucky situation I am in... I donâ€™t have to sacrifice too much to pursue the career I want,â€ he says.

Aarnesâ€™ hourly pay starts at 164 Norwegian kroner (around $20), increasing for weekend and evening shifts. After taxes (which are comparatively high in Scandinavia) heâ€™s left with around 14,000 kroner ($1700) a month, of which he sets aside half for rent, travel and bills and uses the rest for â€œwhatever elseâ€ he likes.

Further down the road in Korsvoll, a 31-year-old business analyst called Ã˜ystein is packing his BMW with supplies for a barbecue. He doesnâ€™t want to share his full name, arguing that â€œeven though Norway is rich, people donâ€™t really want to talk about how rich they are personally.â€ But he admits he earnt enough to buy a two-bedroom apartment on the waterfront when he was 27 and regularly goes on holiday to the US and Asia.

Whatâ€™s Norway doing differently?

A huge part of young Norwegiansâ€™ fantastic lifestyle is down to the countryâ€™s rapid economic growth. After seeing the biggest increase in average earnings of any large high-income economy between 1980 and 2013, it now leads multiple global rankings for wealth and wellbeing. It weathered the global recession well.

Last year it came top of the 2017 Legatum Prosperity Index, which analyses 110 countries around the world.

Norwayâ€™s huge oil and gas sector is the clear driving factor behind the nationâ€™s economic boom over the last three decades, following major discoveries in the North Sea (although falling energy prices in recent years have had an impact).

But as Hilde BjÃ¸rnland, an economics professor based at BI Norwegian Business school in Oslo explains, it is not just how much money Norway makes thatâ€™s significant, but what it does with it.

â€œIt has managed the oil [money] well in that it is saving, and using a portion of that to put back into society,â€ she says. â€œSo rather than a few getting a lot, many people have access to this wealth.â€

Norway has done this by storing its money in the worldâ€™s largest sovereign wealth fund. In simple terms, this is a giant savings pot which makes money by investing in more than 9000 companies. It is currently worth around $1 trillion.

In spite of this savings pot, taxes are kept high and the country has a compressed wage structure, which means minimum salaries are negotiated by unions.

â€œYoung people and people in lower-paid industries have [experienced] the growth rates in their wages each year... and the differences between those who earn a little and those who earn a lot are not so large as in other countries,â€ says BjÃ¸rnland.

The Resolution Foundationâ€™s report on generational income concludes that rising inequality has been a core factor in driving down disposable incomes for millennials in other strong economies such as the US, UK and Germany. In these countries, where there are wider wage bands, young people bear the brunt of a lack of pay growth and job mobility.

By contrast, BjÃ¸rnland argues that an egalitarian approach â€“ distributing wealth between generations â€“ has contributed to strong life satisfaction and a lack of social unrest in Norway.

High welfare payments and heavily subsidised health care also help when it comes to pitting Norwegian millennials' prospects against those elsewhere in Europe. Unemployment benefits are generous: allowing many people to claim around 60% of their previous salary for two years, while they are looking for new work. As in all the Nordic countries, low childcare costs and a general parental leave system also ensure a high participation of women in the workforce.

I have to pay a lot of taxes, but I donâ€™t really care, because I know that the state gives you so many things at the same time â€“ Gabriella Sanzana

Free education at most schools and public universities and easy access to loans (which borrowers donâ€™t pay interest on while they are studying) alongside high employment rates for students are also part of the jigsaw.

â€œItâ€™s a significant factor that while young people are studying, theyâ€™re able to have a job on the side,â€ says BjÃ¸rnland, who adds that this kind of casual work can often bring in a higher income for young people in Norway than those in other western countries.

Her sentiment is shared by many of the throngs of students cooling off in the Ã…kerselva river just a few metres from the shiny glass buildings that dominate the business schoolâ€™s campus.

â€œItâ€™s not that difficult to find a job here and theyâ€™re always really well-paid. So it helps a lot, to cover your leisure life and your studies,â€ says Gabriella Sanzana, a 27-year-old from Chile, whoâ€™s doing a masterâ€™s in human rights while working part-time as a waitress.

â€œI have to pay a lot of taxes, but I donâ€™t really care, because I know that [the state] gives you so many things at the same time.â€

A secure future?

Despite Norwayâ€™s glowing CV, there are concerns about sustaining its success.

High youth employment is declining, according to Investing in Youth: Norway, a recent OECD report, which states that the number of job opportunities for 15 to 29-year-olds doesnâ€™t match up with the amount needed for a swelling youth population, which rose by 18% between 2007 and 2016.

Immigration accounted for over four-fifths of this increase and unemployment among Norwayâ€™s foreign-born population is currently around 10%.

Kristian HeggebÃ¸, a senior researcher at the Centre for Labour and Welfare Research at Oslo Metropolitan University, argues that while well-educated international students and labour migrants from elsewhere in Europe â€œtend to do well on the jobs market,â€ there are persistently high levels of â€œlabour market discrimination against ethnic minorities.â€

For the young Norwegians who are disadvantaged and have social issues, finding their spot in society can be much harder

â€œTo some extent it could be [because of] a lack of qualifications, but there is no doubt in my mind that the issue is on the demand side and not the supply side,â€ he says.

HeggebÃ¸ argues that there is â€œfirm empirical evidenceâ€ which demonstrates that despite rising immigration over the past two decades, many Norwegian employers are still â€œsceptical towards hiring someone with a non-Norwegian background.â€ Even second generation immigrants born and educated in a Nordic country can end up struggling to gain access to the labour market, he says, suggesting that anonymous CVs in the first stages of recruitment could be a crucial part of the solution.

Fragmented society

Preparing to catch the train home after a day in the sweltering city centre, Ove George, whoâ€™s from Nigeria and is currently unemployed, says he believes networking is often the key to getting work in Norway, something that can be tricky for foreigners without Norwegian connections.

â€œThe last job I got was through a Norwegian friend I had, and after that I havenâ€™t really got a good job,â€ he explains.

Also at the station is 19-year-old Djibouti-born Kayad Mahammed, who currently works for a media company. He says heâ€™s â€œnot strugglingâ€ and personally found it â€œeasyâ€ to get a job. But he adds that he believes â€œitâ€™s hard to get richâ€ for many immigrants, who can wind up clinging onto entry-level jobs for fear of ending up unemployed again.

Meanwhile, despite the Scandinavian countryâ€™s pride over its egalitarianism, there are signs inequality is rising within the wider population, too.

OECD figures suggest that the share of Norwegians earning less than half the national average income was 8.1% in 2015, up from 6.9% in 2004, with young people more at risk than any other group. (Although, put this into context, this is still low by global standards â€“ the proportion in the US is 16.8% and 10.9% in the UK.)

Those who end up outside of employment, training or education altogether can often feel more vulnerable in Norway than they might in other countries, argues Sebastian KÃ¶nigs, one of the authors of the OECDâ€™s Investing in Youth: Norway report.

â€œFor the young Norwegians who are disadvantaged and have social issues, finding their spot in society can be much harder,â€ he says. â€œBecause generally speaking everyone is doing so well in society, this becomes a stigma.â€

This cohort is six times more likely to feel depressed than other young Norwegians, nine times as likely to suffer from poor health and more at risk of remaining outside the labour market for the long term, according to OECD figures.

The price of success

According to BjÃ¸rnland, even the wealthiest Norwegians should be wary of its fragility moving forward.

â€œYouâ€™re used to having a good time, youâ€™re used to taking long weekends... if youâ€™ve had it like this for a long time you take it for granted,â€ she says. â€œBut things which have happened in the past might not happen again.â€

This isnâ€™t about the size of the country, this is about how much resources youâ€™re willing to invest in it... Norway perceives this to be a central priority, and it should be

She argues that Norway needs to work harder to diversify its industries in order to remain competitive in future. This might include expanding its technology, raw material and renewable energy sectors, all alongside an emerging start-up scene. It has grown quickly in recent years but still lags behind its Nordic neighbours.

Employers will also have to be more open to attracting international talent to fill the jobs created outside its oil and gas sector, she suggests. On the other hand, young Norwegians â€œused to being able to work wherever they likeâ€ may need to become increasingly â€œfocused on where the skills are neededâ€ in order to maintain the same standard of living as millennials entering the workforce today.

Solutions?

Despite Norwayâ€™s current challenges, many experts believe that there is still a huge amount that other nations can learn.

At the OECD, Sebastian KÃ¶nigs cites much closer links between education, employment and social services than in most other countries as an effective way of supporting young people in the early stages of their careers. Every Norwegian school leaver gets a personal follow-up phone call to discuss their options if they donâ€™t enter the employment market or pursue further studies, for example.

He argues that while Norwayâ€™s population is just 5.1 million, larger nations could still replicate these policies if they wanted to.

â€œThis isnâ€™t about the size of the country, this is about how much resources youâ€™re willing to invest in it... Norway perceives this to be a central priority, and it should be.â€

Meanwhile, Kristian HeggebÃ¸ says he believes that even if oil is taken â€œtotally out of the equationâ€ and Norway is forced to reshape its economy in the future, it will continue to prosper as a result of its egalitarian approach and safety net for young people.

â€œIf we keep these components in place then Iâ€™m willing to bet everything that I own that we will still be performing at a very, very high level compared to other European countries, simply because we have a way [to deal with] difficulties that is more humane.â€

3YO4AH2FPE25M4365CKHF84YBJSQ0P,US plans to sidestep limits on detaining immigrant children,"The Trump administration said Thursday it plans to circumvent a longstanding court agreement that governs how children are treated in immigration custody, in part to detain families longer as a way to deter migrants from crossing the Southwestern border illegally.

The Homeland Security Department announced proposed regulations that would terminate the so-called Flores agreement that requires the government to keep children in the least-restricted setting and required their release generally after 20 days in detention.

The 1997 case that spawned the agreement will almost certainly land back in court. U.S. District Court Judge Dolly M. Gee rejected a request by administration lawyers this summer to allow for longer family detention.

The agreement became an issue during a ""zero-tolerance"" policy enforced at the border to criminally prosecute anyone caught crossing illegally.

More than 2,900 children were separated from their parents, prompting international outrage and scathing criticism over what many said was inhumane treatment of migrants. Officials said children couldn't be in criminal custody with their parents, and were limited in how long they could detain families because of the agreement.

The government currently has three operational family detention centers, but most are at capacity.

However, Homeland Security asked for space to house 12,000 beds for families, plus space to house 20,000 unaccompanied minors. That process is moving forward; the Defense Department has completed legal and environmental requirements needed but they're still working on the legal framework for the use of Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas for immigrant families. The Department of Health and Human Services, which manages unaccompanied children crossing illegally, has not yet formally requested space for the minors, which it must do in order to set up the use.

The rules proposed Thursday would allow the government to hold families until their immigration cases were completed, a move that government officials contend makes cases go much faster than if families are released.

""Today, legal loopholes significantly hinder the department's ability to appropriately detain and promptly remove family units that have no legal basis to remain in the country,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. ""This rule addresses one of the primary pull factors for illegal immigration and allows the federal government to enforce immigration laws as passed by Congress.""

Immigrant advocates have opposed any effort to detain children longer than the agreement allows.

As families who came here seeking sanctuary are now being reunited, we are starting to hear about the anguish that occurred when they were separated by U.S. immigration. If we want to know how detrimental these effects are long term, we can look at the stories of children in the U.S. growing up without a father or mother after one or both of their parents was deported.

Most recently these stories have focused on the deportation of Mexican and Central American nationals. But there is another group that has been confronting this very issue for more than a decade, ever since Cambodia agreed to accept their deported nationals in 2002. Today more than 500 Cambodian nationals have been deported from the U.S. and are living in exile in Cambodia. Their plight is evidence of the increasing criminalization of our immigration policy.

Their journey here began differently. The U.S. Refugee Act of 1980, which established the Office of Refugee Resettlement and our large-scale commitment to refugees, was inspired by the resettlement of Southeast Asian refugees like the Cambodians. Granted legal permanent resident status, the need to take the extra step to become a citizen seemed relatively unimportant until 1996 when several immigration laws passed that greatly increased the deportation of noncitizens. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act expanded the list of deportable offenses and limited the power of immigration judges to review deportations. Almost 10 percent of the 897,099 people deported on criminal grounds between 1997 and 2007, were legal permanent residents according to a 2009 Human Rights Watch report. The majority of them are deported for minor, nonviolent offenses, according to the Immigration Policy Center.

Sophea Phea was deported in 2011 after being arrested for credit card fraud in California. It was her first time in Cambodia. She was born in a Thai refugee camp following the Cambodian genocide that claimed between 21 and 25 percent of the population. When she left California, her son was a little boy of 8. When he came to visit her in Cambodia in 2017 he was taller than her.

It had been so long since she had seen him she didnâ€™t know how to treat him, how to be a mother to him. He would get angry with her for babying him. Her siblings, who were also visiting, scolded her for not disciplining him. But Phea didnâ€™t feel she had the right to discipline him, because she hadnâ€™t been there for him. She could tell he was angry with her for being absent.

â€œMe not being there physically has ruined our relationship,â€ she says.

She found the proof of his hurt in a message he sent to a friend. She says the message said: â€œI lost my mom. My grandmother is dead. All my uncles drink and smoke. My life sucks.â€

In the families recently separated we see mostly the immediate need of the small children. But those children grow up and many of them become angry at what has been taken from them. Policies that separate families in this way are aimed at punishing those who have somehow run afoul of our laws. What is not considered is the long-term effect of that punishment on families and on our society as a whole.

In â€œExiled: From the Killing Fields of Cambodia to California and Backâ€ I follow four Cambodian American families facing deportation. David Ros belongs to one of them. When he was 16, Ros killed a man. He served 19 years. Now he is facing deportation, which will most likely result in permanent separation from his family. Plane tickets to Cambodia are expensive and the trip is long and arduous. At the start of the book his son, Solomon, is 4 and his fatherâ€™s shadow. When Ros puts his shoes on to take the trash out Solomon puts his shoes on as well. Solomon doesnâ€™t want to be separated from his father for even a minute. It is a cute childhood phase, one that would not be broken naturally over time, but instead will be ended abruptly by separation. By the time Solomon is a teenager, there is no telling what that sudden separation will have done to him.

Former Sheriff Joe Arpaio's stance on immigration has led the American Civil Liberties Union to spend $720,000 to oppose his race for the U.S. Senate in Arizona. The money is being spent on television commercials and to send people into neighborhoods to hand out fliers, The Associated Press reported.

Steve Kilar, a spokesman for an ACLU office in Arizona, told The Associated Press that the group is getting involved this year in races in Arizona and other parts of the nation to stress the importance of civil liberties to voters.

It marks the first time the ACLU has participated in voter ""education efforts"" for a federal election, Kilar told The AP.

""Joe Arpaio's record in particular is so emblematic of what can happen if people aren't paying attention to civil liberty records of the people they are electing,"" Kilar told the news outlet.

He added that the ACLU does not endorse candidates.

The ACLU was behind a nearly 11-year-old lawsuit that challenged Arpaio's traffic patrols that targeted illegal immigrants. The patrols ultimately led to federal judge to rule that the sheriff's department was practicing racial profiling, according to the report.

Arpaio faced a criminal contempt of court conviction for ignoring the judge's order to stop the immigration patrols. About a year ago, Arpaio, 86, avoided a possible jail sentence when he was pardoned by President Donald Trump.

""I am pretty happy that they are worried about me,"" said Arpaio, the former Maricopa County sheriff.

Arpaio believes the ACLU is concerned he will win the Aug. 28 GOP primary and go on to defeat Kyrsten Sinema, who is considered the Democratic frontrunner, in the Nov. 6 general election, according to the report.

Voters can likely expect the ACLU to get involved in political races in the future.

""Nationally, I will say that this isn't the last time you will see it happen,"" Kilar said.

Faiz Shakir, the ACLU's national political director, claims the group's new focus is driven by new members who believe President Donald Trump is posing a threat to civil liberties.

Arpaio's GOP opponents are U.S. Rep. Martha McSally and former state Sen. Kelli Ward. The candidates are competing to fill a seat being vacated by Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who is retiring.

The ACLU reported expenditures of $400,000 on Wednesday, according to the report.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/07/26/aclu-spending-money-in-a-federal-election-for-the-first-time-in-history-to-oppose-one-candidate,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Republican', 'Strongly Republican', 'Neutral']","['5', '4', '3', '5', '4']"
30ZKOOGW2XOD6DH7CZRV3D83CGLA1O,Hillary Clinton Says She'll Help Provide Transportation Options for Separated Families,"During OZY Fest, a two-day event in Central Park this weekend, Hillary Clinton sat down for an interview with nonprofit leader Laurene Powell Jobs and shared that she plans to help reunite immigrant families by providing transportation options.

""I'm going to be tweeting about this in the days to come, but if any of you work for an airline please direct-message me because these families will need vouchers and discounted tickets to be reunited over these thousands of miles,"" she said on Saturday, according to the Associated Press.

As a result of the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy at the border, thousands of children have been put into government custody while their parents are sent to immigrant detention centers until they can post bail. One major hurdle parents face once they are released from detention is that they often have to figure out how to get to the state in which their child is being held. If a parent is detained in Arizona, for example, and their child is moved to a foster care facility on the East Coast, they have to find ways to travel across the country with few resources. Activists and volunteers have offered to drive parents in some cases, but Clinton's solution could help to provide a quicker solution for immigrants who have access to their passports and are able to fly.

This isn't the first time that Clinton has discussed the controversial immigration policy: She's previously slammed it as ""truly, unimaginably cruel."" She also tweeted that the policy had created a ""humanitarian crisis"" and that ""every parent who has ever held a child in their arms, every human being with a sense of compassion and decency, should be outraged.""

https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1008806592400314368

The former Secretary of State also pulled no punches when it came to discussing Trump's recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, criticizing what appeared to be the president accepting Putin's denial of Russian interference in the 2016 election over information from U.S. intelligence agencies.

""It's really distressing and alarming,"" Clinton said. ""It should concern every American of any political party because this was a direct attack on our democracy.""

Clinton was just one of the speakers of OZY Fest, which the New York Times described as ""part music festival, part TED talk, part food fair."" The event also included guests like Rose McGowan, Cynthia Nixon, and Michelle Wolf.

31HLTCK4BMDU2GA85D3U6NQMZF4VG9,Politicians blame Mollie Tibbetts' death on immigration laws,"(CNN) After an undocumented immigrant was arrested Tuesday in the presumed death of Mollie Tibbetts , President Donald Trump and other Republican lawmakers blamed the tragedy on the nation's immigration laws.

Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, is being held on a first-degree murder charge in the case of Tibbetts, a 20-year-old University of Iowa college student who was last seen jogging in Brooklyn, east of Des Moines, more than five weeks ago.

He faces life in prison without parole if convicted.

Rivera told police he followed Tibbetts with his car and pursued her when she started running away, said Rick Rahn, special agent in charge at the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation.

Rivera is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, according to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agency sent a detainer request for Rivera to local authorities Tuesday, said Shawn Neudauer, an ICE spokesman.

Rahn said the suspect's motive is unclear.

""I can just tell you it seems that he followed her and seemed to be drawn to her on that particular day and for whatever reason, he chose to abduct her.""

Suspect worked on farm owned by prominent Republican

Rivera has been in the area for four to seven years, Rahn said.

He had worked four years at an Iowa dairy farm based on false identification, his employer said Wednesday.

The farm where he was employed is owned in part by Craig Lang, a prominent Iowa Republican who ran for state secretary of agriculture this summer.

""We are still shocked to learn one of our employees was involved,"" he said in a statement expressing condolences to Tibbetts' family.

""We continue to cooperate with the investigation, and we have provided information about our former employee, including his hiring records, to authorities,"" Craig Lang's statement said. ""There will be plenty of time later to discuss immigration. However, now is not that time. Now is a time to grieve and to remember Mollie.""

Rivera was an employee in good standing who came to work on time and got along with his coworkers, said Dane Lang, the co-owner and manager of Yarrabee Farms.

""What we learned in the last 24 hours is that our employee was not who he said he was,"" he said.

In applying for the job, Rivera provided a state ID and social security card that was verified through the Social Security Administration's verification system, said Lang. But those forms of ID were not of Rivera, he said.

Rivera was not verified through E-verify, a system that is used by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services that verifies an immigrant's status in the US, but only through the Social Security number verification services, Dane Lang said.

Authorities have visited the farm and talked to employees, and the farm is cooperating with the investigation.

Trump calls immigration laws 'a disgrace'

Hours after the arrest was announced, the case started to emerge as yet another rallying point for Republican lawmakers and others who advocate for more restrictive immigration laws.

At a rally in Charleston, West Virginia, President Trump referred to Tibbetts' death -- which hasn't officially been confirmed -- and called the nation's immigration laws ""a disgrace.""

""You heard about today with the illegal alien coming in very sadly from Mexico,"" he said. ""And you saw what happened to that incredible beautiful young woman,"" President Trump said.

""Should have never happened. Illegally in our country,"" Trump said. ""We've had a huge impact, but the laws are so bad, the immigration laws are such a disgrace. We're getting it changed but we have to get more Republicans.""

Immigration activists demand justice

that undocumented immigrants are more dangerous than US citizens. Trump has often suggested , erroneously,that undocumented immigrants are more dangerous than US citizens.

""The killer must be brought to justice. Let's also remember that this is a crime committed by an individual, NOT a community,"" immigration activist Erika Andiola tweeted. ""Of course, there will be some trying to politicize this tragedy. At moments like this, we need leaders who bring us together and move us forward together, not those who exploit tragedy to further divide us. This murder DOES NOT represent me &amp; my community. DON'T GO THERE.""

Democrats and immigration advocates have said that by focusing on outlier criminal cases, Republicans and Trump are distorting the fact that immigrants are no more prone to criminal acts than the native-born population -- and some studies have found they are actually less likely to commit crimes.

Ali Noorani, the executive director of the National Immigration Forum, described it as an ""awful tragedy,"" but warned that the suspect does not represent the values of the immigrant communities.

""The murderer should be brought to justice. He does not belong in the US, nor does he represent the hard work, compassion and contributions of the immigrants, documented or not, who live in the US.""

US Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said on the Senate floor Wednesday that Tibbetts' murder was ""preventable."" Improved technology and increased security personnel ""could've prevented this man from crossing the border,"" he said.

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said residents ""are heartbroken, and we are angry"" about what happened to Tibbetts.

""We are angry that a broken immigration system allowed a predator like this to live in our community, and we will do all we can bring justice to Mollie's killer,"" Reynolds said in statement.

Vice President Mike Pence, who met with Tibbetts's family last week during a visit to Des Moines, said he was ""heartbroken"" by the news.

The teachings of both of these men have recently come up in American politics: Attorney General Jeff SessionsÃ‚ mentioned PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writings to bolster the Trump administration's immigration policy, while pro-immigration advocates have referred to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“love thy neighborÃ¢â‚¬ passage from the Gospel of Mark, widely believed to have been dictated by Peter. Presumably both early Christian leaders would find it strange to see their words appropriated by politicians in a 21st-century democracy that is self-professedly secular. Indeed, both secularism and democracy would be totally alien to two 1st-century Jews who were murdered by the state precisely for their religious beliefs.

More interestingly for us, this recent battle over the Bible raises once more an important question: what role should religious beliefs and institutions play in American society? Is religion mere rhetorical window dressing, aimed at providing a veneer of piety? Or does it play a more fundamental role? Current political trends, as well as a multiplicity of historical examples, suggest that civilization requires a separate, independent, institutional religion that exists in a permanent state of tension with political authority. Religion under such a scheme retains a strong distance and autonomy, free to judge and inform political discourse. Without a separate religious jurisdiction, the state assumes a monolithic, totalitarian power that seeks to dominate and manipulate every aspect of society, becoming an oppressive religion unto itself and a threat to manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intrinsic freedom.

As much as the history of Peter and Paul and their followers is a story of multi-generational, state-sponsored persecution of a new religious faith, Roman rule at the time was in many respects quite laissez-faire. The New Testament, for example, offers numerous examples of government officials evincing a gross indifference to local political and cultural dynamics. Most infamous is the behavior of the Roman procurator Pontius Pilate, who, when charged with determining the fate of the obviously innocent Jesus of Nazareth, is all too eager to Ã¢â‚¬Å“wash his handsÃ¢â‚¬ of the whole affair. As with so many government employees, Pilate hopes his inaction will make Jesus someone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problem, declaring to the Jewish crowd: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am innocent of this righteous manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blood; see to it yourselves.Ã¢â‚¬

Roman political detachment is also in view during the Pauline missionary travels recounted in Acts. While Paul is ministering in Corinth, Jewish leadership seeks to impugn him before Gallio, proconsul of AchaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ia. Rather than defend the obviously persecuted Jewish-Christian, Gallio instead tries to extricate himself, asserting, Ã¢â‚¬Å“since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; I refuse to be a judge of these things.Ã¢â‚¬ He then drives them from the tribunal, and in the tumult the ruler of the synagogue, SosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢thenes, is seized and beaten. Despite the chaos, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gallio paid no attention to this.Ã¢â‚¬

The analysis of renowned historian Mary Beard in her 2015 bestsellerÃ‚ SPQR: A History of Ancient RomeÃ‚ suggests that the approach of Pilate and Gallio was probably normal across the empire. She observes: Ã¢â‚¬Å“so far as we can tell, even under the rule of the emperors there was hardly any such thing as a general policy for running the empire.Ã¢â‚¬ Governors were expected to levy taxes from the locals, keep the peace, and otherwise leave local cultural and political institutions alone. Amazingly, at any one time there were probably fewer than 200 elite Roman administrators, plus maybe a few thousand slaves of the emperor, governing an empire of 50 million people! With such a disinterested imperial policy, it is unsurprising that Pilate, Gallio, and the like would exhibit only as much interest in the affairs of their subjects as was necessary to collect monies and maintain order.

However, Roman citizens were expected to adhere to a few tenets of civil religion. One such requirement was public worship of and deference to Caesar, a means of inculcating allegiance to the state. Because of the intrinsic cultic nature of these acts, this soon became the most explicit area of divergence between Roman pagans and Christians, who refused to worship Caesar as a god. Romans were confused and frustrated by Christian intransigenceÃ¢â‚¬""could Christians not practice their strange, Jewish-derived customs at home while still paying public deference to Rome?

Yet as imperial Rome grew, she progressively sought to replicate, if not assume, the natural role of religion in human society. Caesar declared himself a god. Octavian, the adopted son of Caesar, subsequently had himself pronounced Ã¢â‚¬Å“son of a god.Ã¢â‚¬ He also, so Roman biographers tell us, allegedly ascended to heaven. Ancient writers tell us that Vespasian, who reigned about one generation after Christ, allegedly restored sight to a blind man by spitting in his eyes and cured another manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s withered hand by standing on it. These purported heroics had little impact on the the vast majority of the citizens of the empire, who lived in poverty, their identities and needs far removed from their rulers.

G.K. Chesterton offers a humorous and poignant observation about Greco-Roman society at the time of Christ:

There comes an hour in the afternoon when the child is tired of ""pretending""; when he is weary of being a robber or a Red Indian. It is then that he torments the cat. There comes a time in the routine of an ordered civilization when the man is tired of playing at mythologyÃ¢â‚¬|. The effect of this staleness is the same everywhere; it is seen in all drug-taking and dram-drinking and every form of the tendency to increase the dose. Men seek stranger sins or more startling obscenities as stimulants to their jaded senseÃ¢â‚¬|. They seemed to be saying that God was dead and they they themselves had seen him die.

The megalomania of the 1st-century Roman emperors, epitomized in the lunacy of Caligula and the lechery of Nero, evinces Ã¢â‚¬Å“tormenting the catÃ¢â‚¬ on a global scale. It is little wonder so many eagerly converted to the Christian faith, which promised a king who truly loved and provided for his subjects. Jesus tells his disciples that heaven rejoices at the repentance of a single sinner. Subjects of his kingdom are to be concerned with the most marginalized, honored even for giving them a Ã¢â‚¬Å“cup of cold water.Ã¢â‚¬ Jesus elsewhere declares Ã¢â‚¬Å“the last will be first, and the first lastÃ¢â‚¬: indeed, the members of this kingdom are exhorted to invite to their feasts Ã¢â‚¬Å“the maimed, the lame, the blind.Ã¢â‚¬ Yet Jesus also asserts to Pilate during his interrogation that his kingdom is Ã¢â‚¬Å“not of this world.Ã¢â‚¬

As its doctrines developed and coalesced into a coherent whole, Christianity perceived that a strong distinction between religious faith and civil authority was necessary to restrain the totalitarian instincts of the state and preserve manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s freedom. The doctrine of the ""separation of church and state"" is not necessarily an Enlightenment idea, but one with roots in ancient Christianity. St. Augustine in his great work TheÃ‚ City of God perceived two important but fundamentally distinct worlds: the city of God, composed of the Church and its adherents, and the city of man, the secular world. The 5th-century Pope Gelasius I in turn pronounced a doctrine of ""two swords,Ã¢â‚¬ one being the Church, the other the state. These swords perform different functions and must remain separate, though religion must have the autonomy to judge and inform politics.

Imperial Rome's fears of a rebellious Christian citizenry were ultimately unfounded. The new faith was no threat to Roman political orderÃ¢â‚¬""indeed, it fostered patriotic, law-abiding citizens, giving its adherents something the state cannot give: purpose, transcendence, and a robust moral code. These qualities created a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium between church and state. This paradigm existed in various forms in the eastern Roman Empire until the collapse of Constantinople in 1453, and in the Western Roman Empire and its successor medieval manifestations until the subsequent disintegration of Christendom during the Reformation and the religious wars of the 17th century.

Moreover, contra popular opinion, the Church of these centuries served to restrain the centripetal power of the state. Ambrose, friend of Augustine and bishop of Milan, excommunicated the Roman emperor Theodosius for the massacre of 7,000 people at Thessalonica in 390 A.D., and didn't restore him until he performed public penances. Similarly, Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV was excommunicated by Pope Gregory VII in 1077 for interfering in Church affairsÃ¢â‚¬""Henry spent days penitently kneeling in the snow outside the pontiffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s winter residence at Canossa. The medieval Church checked the scope and terror of war with policies like the Ã¢â‚¬Å“peace of God,Ã¢â‚¬ which limited the days permitted to engage in battle. Historians like Thomas Madden and Rodney StarkÃ‚ have demonstrated that the heresy courts of the Inquisition, contrary to serving as hotbeds of volatile religious fervor, were attempts by the Church to curb the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wanton execution of religio-political dissidents.

What replaced this state-church dynamic was a set of post-Enlightenment societies that often renewed the Roman challenge to play both king and priest, inevitably reverting to the same gross errors of the ancient empire. Nazi Germany, the USSR, and the PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Republic of China are all exemplars of how political authorities seeking to fashion a new humanist religious cult around the state demand subservience at the barrel of a gun. North KoreaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s founder Kim Il-sung, a descendant of Protestant clergy and raised in a devout Presbyterian family, aimed to replicate the devotion and transcendence of Christian belief and practice in the formation of his own state communist religion.

The United States is far from such a totalitarian regime, though the ancient impulse to unite state and religion periodically rears its head. States and cities, for example, have sought to punish Catholic adoption services because of their beliefs regarding sexuality; under the last administration, Catholic medical providers were targeted. Such anti-religious policies are endorsed by senior political leadership. During a hearing over federal judge applicant and devout Catholic Amy Coney Barrett, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein lectured: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The dogma lives loudly within you.... And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of concern.Ã¢â‚¬ During a similar confirmation hearing for Russell Vought, nominee for deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, Democratic Senator Bernie SandersÃ‚ took issue with VoughtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Christianity and beliefs regarding Islam. Sanders asserted that the composition of VoughtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faith was Ã¢â‚¬Å“indefensible, it is hateful, it is Islamophobic, and it is an insult to over a billion Muslims throughout the world.Ã¢â‚¬

As it was in Rome, so is it now in the West that those who are unwilling to bend the knee to the progressivist socio-political project and its various public rites find themselves marginalized and mocked, if not harassed and attacked. The state will largely leave you to your own personal devices so long as you refrain from violating such gods of non-transcendent church-state fusion as sexual license, tolerance, and pluralism. Yet as is increasingly clear, this paradigm is itself oppressive and inflexible in its aims. Also like Rome, this civil religion is incapable of giving citizens a robust, complete conception of man's being and end, substituting instead the economic, cultural, and spiritual poverty of globalization, consumerism, and technology addiction.

Alexis de Tocqueville observed: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Religion in America takes no direct part in the government of society, but it must be regarded as the first of their political institutions; for if it does not impart a taste for freedom, it facilitates the use of it.Ã¢â‚¬ Truly religious belief frees men from the soul-crushing philosophies of materialism and humanism, while inculcating a deeper sense of being and purpose, qualities all good citizens must possess. Without that otherworldly, transcendent perspective provided by strong, independent religious institutions, we will indeed look to the state as our god, and it will inevitably betray us, as did Soviet Russia, the Third Reich, and the original imperial Rome. As we remember Peter and Paul, we should be mindful that an autonomous religious faith, particularly of a Judeo-Christian flavor, is no threat to the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stability or viability, but indeed the salt that preserves and strengthens it.",https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/religion-is-the-salt-that-preserves-the-state/,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Strongly Republican']","['1', '1', '1', '2', '3']"
3OCZWXS7ZPPTQE9UADIXFH1VILGL5G,John McCain is who Arizona,"Opinion: John McCain didn't just reflect the Arizona of his times. He was who we wanted to be.

John McCain, R-Ariz., right, accompanied by Chair of the National Constitution Center's Board of Trustees, former Vice President Joe Biden, waves as he takes the stage before receiving the Liberty Medal in Philadelphia, Monday, Oct. 16, 2017.

John McCain succeeded Barry Goldwater as U.S. senator.

Thereâ€™s a bit of cosmic appropriateness to that. Goldwater was a comfortable fit for the Arizona of his time, as McCain has been for the Arizona of his time.

Goldwater was an Arizona original. His rugged features and rugged individualism reflected a state transitioning into modernity.

McCain was an adopted Arizonan, as are so many of us. He came from somewhere else, but his somewhat incongruous combination of plainspokenness, populism and cosmopolitanism reflected who we had become.

McCain rose fast but never acted entitled

CLOSE Sen. John McCain discusses his most enduring contribution to the Senate during an interview with The Arizona Republic on Aug. 3, 2017. Thomas Hawthorne/azcentral.com

McCain came to Arizona looking to represent the state in Congress. I met him shortly after he arrived. He sought me out for advice and insight on what congressional seats might be coming open.

I told him he should consider getting into Arizona politics more slowly. Get involved in the campaigns of other people. Become active in the party. Maybe run for the state Legislature after a while. Work his way up.

Less than two years later, McCain was in the U.S. House of Representatives. Less than six years later, he was in the U.S. Senate.

That was the last time McCain asked me for political advice. I never blamed him.

McCain didnâ€™t have to work his way up in the minds of Arizonans. He had earned a position at the front of the line because of the suffering and sacrifice he had made on behalf of his country as a prisoner of war.

McCain, however, never acted politically entitled. In fact, he won his first primary in Arizona in part by outworking his better established opponents. And he never subsequently took any election for granted, however weak his opponent might be.

Conservative, not 'a conservative'

McCainâ€™s political philosophy was a subject of controversy over the years and during his maverick years he set the teeth of many conservatives on edge.

I borrowed a formulation to describe McCain that Bill Buckley used for both President Bushes. That McCain was â€œconservative,â€ but not â€œa conservative.â€ Meaning that McCain usually instinctively sided with the conservative position, but his approach to issues wasnâ€™t deeply rooted in or anchored by conservative ideology. That description remains in McCainâ€™s Wikipedia biography.

McCain described himself as a â€œRonald Reagan-Teddy Roosevelt Republicanâ€ when he first ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. At the time, I thought that ridiculous and mocked it. Reagan and Roosevelt shared a party affiliation by historical accident. Their views on the proper role of government couldnâ€™t be more different.

Iâ€™ve since come to regard it as a pretty insightful self-description. McCain generally shared Reaganâ€™s full-spectrum conservatism, if not Reaganâ€™s rootedness in conservative ideology. But he shared Rooseveltâ€™s independent spirit. And departed from Reaganâ€™s full-spectrum conservatism with Rooseveltâ€™s populist suspicion about the accumulation of economic power.

McCainâ€™s approach to politics and issues was largely instinctual. Things struck him as right or wrong, and he talked about them in those terms.

CLOSE After his 2008 presidential election defeat, John McCain resurrected ""the maverick"" upon his return to the Senate, opposing President Barack Obama, championing immigration reform and acting as a counterweight to GOP President Donald Trump.

McCain never really flip-flopped

This led to inconsistencies over time. But they werenâ€™t really flip-flops or the abandonment of principle. They were simply different instinctual responses based upon the circumstances that presented themselves at the time.

For example, McCain was accused of abandoning principle in voting for the Republican tax reform plan last year. Thatâ€™s because he had voted against the tax cut plan of George W. Bush in part because it favored the wealthy too much.

However, as the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, he supported retaining the Bush tax rates. And the top rate under last yearâ€™s GOP tax reform is still higher than the top rate under Bush.

Iâ€™m not sure Arizonans have understood what a giant McCain has been on foreign policy. He traveled the world extensively. His trips werenâ€™t given the significance of a presidential visit. But they werenâ€™t just congressional courtesy sessions either.

Occasionally word would get out about a foreign government doing something because McCain urged them to. I suspect there was a lot more of that than reached the public.

In recent years, McCain has become the most consequential advocate of an aggressive U.S. leadership role in the world. His words had weight. His views mattered, at home and abroad.

McCain never became president. But in 35 years in Arizona politics, he was never run close in a single election.

Thatâ€™s because he became more than just one of us. He was who we wanted to be.

3XAOZ9UYR095TTOO1VOHTDN8GY6Q1A,Why Nike sees its Colin Kaepernick ad as a win,"Most advertisers try to avoid controversy, but Nike welcomes it. Look no further than the sporting goods giant's decision to feature former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick in the 30th anniversary version of its ""Just Do It"" ad campaign. The company seems unconcerned that the move is angering some consumers so much that they're posting videos of themselves on social media torching Nike merchandise and caused its stock price to fall on Tuesday.

No matter. The largest maker of athletic apparel will feature the now-teamless football player in both TV and online ads -- whose tagline is ""Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything"" -- and will create an apparel line for him. It will also contribute to Kaepernick's charity, Know Your Rights.

Nike first partnered with the 30-year-old Kaepernick in 2011 and stood by him when he attracted heated criticism for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police shootings of unarmed African Americans. Many other players followed Kaepernick's lead. But President Donald Trump and his allies denounced the player protests as un-American and called for teams to fire any participants.

Kaepernick opted out of his contract in 2017 when it appeared the San Francisco 49ers would cut him during the off-season. He subsequently sued the National Football League, alleging that team owners are colluding to prevent him from signing with another organization. An arbitrator ruled last week that Kaepernick's case can proceed to trial.

A few weeks after President Trump's inauguration, Nike launched a high-profile ""Equality"" campaign featuring basketball's LeBron James and tennis star Serena Williams, along with Ibtihaj Muhammad, a Muslim-American fencer who wears a traditional hijab when competing, and transgender triathlete Chris Mosier. Nike also recently issued a statement supporting Williams after French Open officials banned the Nike ""catsuit"" Williams wore during the tournament.

""They are aligned with their athletes and always supported their athletes â€¦ in a very authentic way,"" said Joe Flores, executive vice president and co-head of sports and entertainment at MWWPR. ""It wasn't forced. Colin Kaepernick's stance on this has been steadfast throughout the entire process. It's not about picking one side or another. It's really about applauding what Mr. Kaepernick had to give up to make his point.""

Other marketers noted approvingly that the campaign has made a big splash and set Nike apart. And they said it could solidify Nike's bond with athletes, especially black ones, an important consideration for a company that relies heavily on sports stars to endorse its products.

Brian Gordon, CEO of Engine Shop, a sports and entertainment marketing agency, said the ad is provocative but ""authentic to who they are and the communities they represent and speak to,"" including the athletes. ""Even in the face of potential backlash, they support their athlete partners, and that's an incredibly powerful statement to the athlete community,"" Gordon said.

""What you stand for is almost as important as what you make,"" BrandSimple marketing consultant Allen Adamson said. ""It's a polarized marketplace. No matter what you do, you offend some people."" Nike is focused on what it stands for, he added, ""and if that upsets some users, so be it.""

Robert Passikoff, founder of marketing consultancy Brand Keys, said an ad like Nike's will divide people, but the outrage won't last. ""My guess is that the audience that is reacting so badly to this aren't buying a lot of Nikes anyway,"" he said. ""They'll move on to the next thing. Welcome to the 21st century.""

Nike noted that Kaepernick will be one of many athletes in the ""Just Do It"" campaign, which is ""a compilation of the most inspirational athletes around sport -- athletes who have chased crazy dreams, no matter the obstacle or outcome,"" a company spokeswoman told the The Wall Street Journal.

Other brands have also endured the wrath of consumers for taking controversial positions

Earlier this year, Dick's Sporting Goods decided to quit selling assault-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines in the wake of the massacre at Parkland High School in Florida. The sporting goods retailer also restricted gun sales to consumers aged 21 and older. Apple has also taken positions on hot-button issues such as immigration and climate change.

""Controversy is increasingly becoming the cost of doing business for brands,"" said Mike May, vice president of business strategy for Huge, a digital marketing and advertising agency. ""What we have seen over the past couple of years is that customers across a range of industries are increasingly choosing the brands they want to engage with based on value systems that match their own.""

Nike has a ""world-class marketing organization"" and understood that its campaign would anger some customers while connecting with many more, according to May.

""It's seductive for brands all of a sudden to be at the center of a conversation of 20 million or 50 million or 100 million people,"" he said, ""when previously you were paying millions of dollars to reach a fraction of that.""
