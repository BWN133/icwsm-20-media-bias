â— ME-Sen: Candidate filing closed last week for Maine's June 12 primary, and the Bangor Daily News has a list of candidates available here. Note that this election marks the first time that instant-runoff voting will be used in a statewide primary anywhere in the country; we'll discuss that in our ME-Gov section.

Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, is seeking a second term, and he remains the heavy favorite. Termed-out Gov. Paul LePage spent years keeping people guessing as to whether or not he'd challenge King, and Trump reportedly encouraged him to jump in back in December. However, now that filing has closed, we can finally definitively say that LePage won't run. State Sen. Eric Brakey actually has been running since April, and he's likely to be the GOP nominee. However, Brakey has attracted little attention from national Republicans, and he ended 2017 with just $85,000 in the bank.

There also will be a Democrat on the general election ballot against King. Educator Zak Ringelstein has some support from several state legislators, though he ended 2017 with only $62,000 on-hand. However, it's unlikely that the general election will be close enough for Ringelstein to do much damage to King. Back in 2012, King beat his GOP opponent 53-31, while a Democrat took just 13 percent.

â— MS-Sen-B: Republican Gov. Phil Bryant announced on Monday that he won't appoint Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves to replace GOP Sen. Thad Cochran when the latter resigns on April 1 due to health issues. Reeves is a likely candidate to succeed the term-limited Bryant in the 2019 gubernatorial election, so this decision does not come as a surprise. The Clarion Ledger reports that Bryant's shortlist to replace Cochran is in fact very short. Anonymous insiders tell the paper that Bryant is considering just two Republican names: Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann and state Agriculture Commissioner Cindy Hyde-Smith, both of whom have previously been mentioned as likely contenders for the appointment

Bryant had previously signaled that he wants to appoint a candidate who will then run in the nonpartisan November special election rather than a placeholder, but whoever that is will first have to get past hard-right state Sen. Chris McDaniel. But speaking of McDaniel, his campaign has so far struggled to consolidate the backing of the same groups that supported him in his narrow loss to Cochran in the 2014 primary. Most notably, the hardline anti-tax Club for Growth and the insurgent Senate Conservatives Fund have held off on endorsing McDaniel despite backing him in 2014. Club for Growth president David McIntosh recently said his organization is waiting to see whom Bryant appoints to fill the seat before making a decision about whether to help McDaniel again.

â— NV-Sen: Candidate filing closed on Friday for Nevada's June 12 primary, and the state has a list of candidates available here.

Sen. Dean Heller is the most vulnerable Senate Republican in the country, but he lost his only credible primary foe last week when Danny Tarkanian dropped down to run in the 3rd Congressional District (again). Heller can now concentrate on his general election campaign against his likely Democratic foe, Rep. Jacky Rosen, who beat Tarkanian in a competitive 2016 race. We haven't seen any polling here since the summer.

State and national Democrats have consolidated behind Rosen, and her only noteworthy primary opponent is attorney Jesse Sbaih. Sbaih has loaned his campaign $2 million, but if 2016 is any indication, he may not use most of that money. Back then, Sbaih took on Rosen in the primary in the 3rd and loaned himself roughly $500,000, but he ended up returning $450,000 to himself after he lost the nomination in a 62-13 drubbing.

â— UT-Sen: Candidate filing closed last Thursday for Utah's June 26 primary, and the state has a list of candidates available here.

GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch announced at the beginning of the year that he would retire, and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney immediately became the heavy favorite to succeed him. Romney is incredibly popular in Utah, and he even received an endorsement last month from Donald Trump. Back in 2016, Romney said that if Trump ""had said 4 years the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement"" in 2012, but he didn't seem to have much of a problem accepting it in February.

A few Republican office-holders did express interest in taking on Romney, but the only one who stepped up in the end was state Rep. Mike Kennedy. To say that Kennedy's odds are long would be an understatement, and he may not even make it to June. Kennedy is competing at the April 21 GOP convention, and if he doesn't obtain enough support for delegates to win a place on the ballot, his campaign will be over. Romney will be at the convention as well, but he's also collecting signatures so that he can make the primary ballot in case something goes wrong in April.

Democrats haven't won a statewide race in Utah since Jan Graham was re-elected as attorney general in 1996, and that streak is unlikely to be broken this year. Still, Team Blue does have a credible candidate in Salt Lake County Councilor Jenny Wilson. As Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and Pennsylvania Rep.-elect Conor Lamb would tell you, it's always good to field good candidates for tough races in case lighting strikes.

â— WI-Sen: Former Bush administration U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, a neo-conservative hardliner, is out with new TV and radio ads in support of businessman Kevin Nicholson in the GOP primary, backed by $278,000 from Bolton's super PAC. The TV spot features Bolton speaking to the camera and narrating as he praises Nicholson's Marine service and touts him as someone who will take a strong stance against terrorism.

â— WV-Sen: State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has released an internal poll from Osage Research that shows him leading the Republican primary for Senate. Morrisey takes first place with 24 percent, followed by disgraced coal baron Don Blankenship at 22 and Rep. Evan Jenkins at 17. This poll comes in response to a recent Jenkins internal from Harper Polling that had the congressman edging Blankenship for first place by a 29-27 margin, while Morrisey was stuck in last at 19 percent.

These dueling internal polls paint a conflicting picture of who is in the lead, but we have little in the way of independent polling to compare them to. Nevertheless, both surveys show Blankenship may not just be a quixotic candidate but could actually stand a very real chance of scoring an upset to win the primary. However, there are still several weeks to go until the May 8 primary, and neither Morrisey nor Jenkins has begun running attack ads against Blankenship over his conviction for violating mine safety laws, which led to the deaths of 29 miners in a 2010 catastrophe.

Gubernatorial

â— CA-Gov: Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has released an internal poll from David Binder Research that shows what every other poll has found: Newsom is the clear front-runner to take one of two general election spots in the June 5 primary. The survey has Newsom at 26 percent while businessman John Cox, a Republican, snags the second slot with 16. Democratic state Treasurer John Chiang is right on Cox's heels at 13, while former Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa takes 12, GOP Assemblyman Travis Allen is at 10, former Democratic state education Superintendent Delaine Eastin is at 7, and former Hillary Clinton campaign national political director Amanda Renteria brings up the rear with 4.

This survey appears to be the first publicly available poll after Renteria launched her surprise long-shot campaign, and it seems as though her candidacy may be hurting Villaraigosa, who is the only other notable Latino candidate in the race. Previously released polls have suggested Villaraigosa could make the top-two alongside Newsom, shutting Republicans out entirely, but Newsom undoubtedly would prefer to face a Republican rather than a fellow Democrat in the general election in this dark-blue state.

Meanwhile, Renteria made waves last week when she called on Newsom to resign as lieutenant governor over an affair with a city hall aide more than a decade ago when he was San Francisco's mayor. However, pretty much no one in California politics has backed Renteria on this, and several women who support Newsom have denounced her call for his resignation as a cheap political stunt; incoming state Senate leader Toni Atkins even argued it ""distracts from the real importance and urgency of the #MeToo movement."" It's unclear whether this will even be an issue against Newsom, since none of his other rivals has tried to use it against him.

â— CO-Gov: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is making a $1 million donation to a super PAC supporting former state Sen. Mike Johnston, who is running in the Democratic primary for governor. Bloomberg has funded candidates in races around the country who support new gun-safety measures, and his spokesperson hailed Johnston for his efforts to combat gun violence while serving in the legislature.

â— CT-Gov: On Monday, New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart announced she would seek the GOP nomination for governor, a move that came two months after she formed an exploratory committee. The only notable Republican who is still in exploratory mode at this point is state Sen. Toni Boucher. Stewart now enters an extremely crowded August primary. Just how crowded are we talking about? Here are the other noteworthy declared GOP candidates:

Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton

Stamford Director of Administration Michael Handler

Trumbull First Selectman Tim Herbst

Shelton Mayor Mark Lauretti

Attorney and 2014 secretary of state nominee Peter Lumaj

Businessman and 2012 CT-04 nominee Steve Obsitnik

State Rep. Prasad Srinivasan

Former business executive Bob Stefanowski

Hedge fund founder David Stemerman

Former United States Comptroller General David Walker

The field might be winnowed at the Republican convention, which will be held May 11-12. However, any candidates who don't get the support of at least 15 percent of the delegates can still reach the primary ballot if they can get 9,600 valid signatures from registered Republican voters before the June 12 deadline.

â— ID-Gov: Idaho First PAC, which is supporting developer Tommy Ahlquist and is funded partly by Ahlquist's father, is out with a new TV ad attacking his two rivals in the Republican primary for governor. The spot hammers Rep. Raul Labrador and Lt. Gov. Brad Little for being ""long-time politicians."" It specifically blasts Labrador for voting against school and road funding, while it accuses Little of supporting tax increases.

â— IL-Gov: Republican pollster Victory Research is out with their second and final poll of the Democratic primary for governor. However, as we noted last time, there are huge red flags when it comes to the pollster's principle, Rod McCulloch, who once falsified signatures for a candidate seeking to get on the ballot in 2008 and was convicted of perjury in connection with the case, receiving a sentence of probation. While we have no way of saying whether McCulloch has since redeemed himself, his past is worth bearing in mind as you consider the results.

In any event, this new poll has billionaire J.B. Pritzker taking first with 32 percent, businessman Chris Kennedy at 26 percent, and state Sen. Daniel Biss at 22 percent. That actually represents a slight uptick for Pritzker and a major gain for Kennedy compared to Victory's February survey, where Pritzker led Biss just 27-24 while Kennedy took just 17. Notably, both of Victory's polls have given Pritzker narrower leads than he has enjoyed in every other publicly available survey for months. It's possible Victory is onto something that other pollsters haven't caught, but we'll know soon enough who was closest to the mark with the primary finally taking place on Tuesday.

â— ME-Gov: Notorious GOP Gov. Paul LePage is mercifully termed-out, and both parties have large fields seeking to replace him. However, the state's new, and perhaps only temporary, instant-runoff voting (IRV) system introduces some extra unpredictability to the June primaries. Voters will be allowed to rank their choices, and if no candidate takes a majority, the last-place candidate gets eliminated and has their votes reassigned to their voters' next preferences. However, June may be the only time Maine votes this way, at least for a while.

The backstory is long, so here is what you need to know about what's happening in June. The state legislature passed a law that effectively repealed a voter-approved IRV law last year, but IRV proponents successfully put a measure on the June primary ballot to undo the legislature's repeal. The new ballot measure freezes the repeal effort, so the primaries will be conducted using instant-runoff voting. If voters in June decide to approve the repeal law, then it will once again take only a simple plurality of the vote to win office in November. And if voters undo the repeal â€¦ things could get really complicated in November. But we'll cross that messy bridge only if and when we come to it.

Now, to the actual candidates. On the Democratic side, there are seven hopefuls in total, though the three main contenders appear to be state Attorney General Janet Mills, attorney and renewable energy entrepreneur Adam Cote, and former state House Speaker Mark Eves.

Mills may have the most name recognition, though she's never run statewide before: In Maine, the attorney general is appointed by the legislature rather than elected, and Mills has served continuously since 2013. Mills also has the backing of EMILY's List. However, the attorney general has drawn the ire of some progressive groups, including the state Conservation Voters and ACLU, over what they consider to be her opposition to local Native American fishing rights.

Cote, meanwhile, had the largest war chest of any of the Democrats at the end of 2017. Cote, who earned a Bronze Star in 2014 for his service with the Maine National Guard in Afghanistan, has only run for office once before. He lost a 2008 bid for the U.S. House to eventual winner Chellie Pingree 44-28, but he reportedly impressed party leaders in defeat.

Finally, there's Eves, who was in the news quite a bit in 2015. Back then, LePage threatened to cut off funding for a charter school if it didn't withdraw its job offer to Eves to serve as its president; legislators discussed impeachment, but the idea never went anywhere. Eves filed a civil suit against LePage, but a judge ultimately dismissed it.

A few other contenders are also seeking the Democratic nod, and given how unpredictable this race is, we can hardly rule out any of them winning it. There's state Sen. Mark Dion, who also served as sheriff of Cumberland, the largest county in the state, until 2010. Betsy Sweet has been a lobbyist for progressive caucuses, and she's trying to qualify for public campaign financing. Former state Rep. Diane Russell and former Biddeford Mayor Donna Dion are also in.

Five Republicans are running. LePage hasn't publicly taken sides in the primary, but some of his allies, including his daughter, are backing businessman Shawn Moody. Moody ran for governor in 2010 as an independent and took fourth place with 5 percent of the vote; afterwards, the governor himself appointed his former rival to serve as a trustee for both the University of Maine System and Maine Community College System. Moody has done some considerable self-funding, and he had by far the most money of any of the candidates at the end of December, with $260,000 in the bank.

Former state Health Commissioner Mary Mayhew is also a LePage allyâ€”or at least was. During her time in office, Democrats have criticized Mayhew for pushing for cuts to vital programs, and they blamed her after the Riverview Psychiatric Center lost federal certification. Mayhew's fellow Republicans unsurprisingly see her in a much more favorable light. Given LePageworld's apparent fondness for Moody, though, it's not clear how highly the governor still thinks of her.

State House Minority Leader Ken Fredette has been a loud LePage defender, but his fundraising has been particularly bad. State Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason is close to the state's conservative Evangelical political network, and he was a prominent supporter of Ted Cruz during the GOP primary caucus, which Cruz decisively won. Mason, notably, has qualified for public financing.

The one Republican running who is definitively on the outs with LePage is state Senate President Mike Thibodeau. While the two used to be allies, they came into conflict in a budget fight last year, and LePage hasn't hidden how much he hates Thibodeau. Back in January, LePage said that, while he wouldn't endorse anyone in the primary, he would be sure to oppose Thibodeau.

And what would a Maine race be without some independents? There are just too many third-party and non-aligned candidates to name, but there are two in particular worth keeping an eye on. Businessman Alan Caron has already done some self-funding, and he seems to be pitching himself as a left-leaning contender.

Lastly, state Treasurer Terry Hayes was a Democrat when she was in the legislature, but she had a falling out with the party in 2012 when the caucus picked Eves to serve as speaker instead of her. In 2014 and 2016, she successfully secured enough support from Republicans and a few Democrats in the legislature (the treasurer, like the attorney general, is appointed) to beat the Democratic candidate.

â— MI-Gov: The United Auto Workers, which is the largest union in Michigan and has 385,000 members nationwide, has endorsed former state Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer in the Democratic primary for governor. Whitmer faces wealthy businessman Shri Thanedar and former Detroit Health Commissioner Abdul El-Sayed, but she is the front-runner for the nomination.

â— NV-Gov: GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval is termed-out, and Team Red is hoping to win their sixth straight victory for this office. The frontrunner in the June primary is Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the grandson of former Sen. Paul Laxalt.

Not too many voters may remember elder Laxalt, who has been out of office since 1987 (and is now 95), but his son has established a reputation as an ardent conservative. Laxalt is close to the Koch brothers and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, and money will not be a concern for him. Laxalt's main primary foe is state Treasurer Dan Schwartz, who has a poor relationship with the party establishment and has been self-funding most of his campaign. Schwartz has portrayed Laxalt as too extreme, which is probably not a winning argument in a GOP primary.

The Democratic side features a matchup between two fellow Clark County commissioners: Steve Sisolak and Chris Giunchigliani. Sisolak has been fundraising for a future campaign for years, and he had a huge $5.75 million to $1 million cash-on-hand edge at the end of 2017. Sisolak also has the backing of former Sen. Harry Reid, who still wealds considerable power in Nevada Democratic politics.

However, Giunchigliani may have a few openings against Sisolak. Sisolak has embraced his moderate reputation, arguing in June that he's ""not real liberal"" and ""not real conservative."" By contrast, Giunchigliani is well-liked by the party base. It's also possible a controversy over the $1.9 billion football stadium to bring the Oakland Raiders to Las Vegas could hurt Sisolak. Sisolak backed a controversial $750 million hotel tax to pay for part of the stadium, while Giunchigliani was the one member of the county commission to vote against it.

A few independents are also running. The most noteworthy is Ryan Bundy, a son and ally of notorious rancher and far-right hero Cliven Bundy. It's unclear if Bundy will have an impact on the race, but if he does, it probably won't be in a way the GOP likes.

â— NY-Gov: On Monday, actress and activist Cynthia Nixon announced she'd challenge New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in this September's Democratic primary, giving the incumbent his highest-profile opponent ever. Nixon, calling herself a ""strong progressive alternative,"" immediately went hard at Cuomo, branding the governor ""a centrist and Albany insider"" whose administration ""has been defined by a string of indictments for corruption"" and has neglected the New York City subway. She also specifically called Cuomo out for ""his support for a backroom deal which handed Republicans control of the state Senate, resulting in the failure of numerous pieces of progressive legislation.""

Nixon shot to stardom playing the role of Miranda on the HBO comedy ""Sex and the City"" from 1998 to 2004, but more recently, she's grown increasingly involved in the political world, particularly in the areas of education and LGBT equality. Nixon came out as gay in 2004 and married her longtime partner, Christine Marinoni, in 2012, which could help neutralize a key accomplishment Cuomo is sure to tout to appeal to liberals: his successful push to legalize same-sex marriage in the state in 2011.

Cuomo will also undoubtedly highlight the SAFE Act, the gun safety measure he passed in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting. But many of his other supposed liberal accomplishments have been half-measures, to which he ""has had to be dragged kicking and screaming, coming around only when he realized it might be politically advantageous to do so,"" as Alan Greenblatt wrote in Governing magazine last year. That includes things like a bill that raises the minimum wage to $15, but that will only be fully implemented after seven years and in the meantime allows employers to pay a lower wage outside of New York City.

And Cuomo's outright sins are many. Chief among them, as Nixon charges, is Cuomo's tacit backing of the GOP's grip on the Senateâ€”with the aid of several turncoat Democrats Cuomo's deliberately never sought to corralâ€”which has resulted in a years-long blockade of a huge array of progressive priorities. That includes a state-level DREAM Act, a bill that would enshrine the rights guaranteed by Roe v. Wade in state law, and anything resembling meaningful ethics reform (Cuomo's former top aide, by the way, was just found guilty on corruption charges)â€”but the full list is miles long.

Yet Cuomo will be as formidable as they come. Despite his open distaste for liberal politics, Cuomo sports a 67-25 favorability rating among Democrats in a new poll from Siena College, and he starts off with a dominant 66-19 lead on Nixon, who, despite her fame, is still unknown to most voters but does have a positive 26-16 score with members of her own party. (The poll was conducted before Nixon announced.)

Cuomo also has an astonishing $30 million war chest, thanks to New York's lax campaign finance regime and his closeness to moneyed interests. Nixon, by contrast, says she won't accept corporate donations. Cuomo also maintains broad support from labor, to whom he's generally been accommodating out of pure expediency (except for the teachers unions, which, as an ally of charter schools, he's spat on throughout tenure).

More than anything, though, Cuomo is known as a savage operator who has few scruples when it comes to thwarting his opponents, whether in the legislature or on the campaign trail. As Michael Caputo, a Republican strategist who advised Donald Trump about a possible gubernatorial bid against Cuomo in 2014, put it last year, ""There isn't a counterpunch Andrew Cuomo won't throw.""

Nixon, however, represents a very different sort of opponent than Cuomo is accustomed to. Last year, after Nixon hammered the governor on education policy in an appearance on the ""Today"" show, Cuomo's response was uncharacteristically restrained: A spokesperson would only say, ""We know Ms. Nixon is a passionate advocate for education, and we would be happy to sit down with her anytime to talk about it.""

It may be that Cuomo understood that the optics of attacking a celebrity who (at least at the time) was not actively seeking office were sub-optimal, so his stance may soon change now that Nixon has joined the race. But Nixon still has some advantages: She has no public record to criticize, she's anything but a career politician, and she undoubtedly knows lots of wealthy people who'll be glad to contribute generously to her campaign. And in the Trump era, she might be able to mobilize angry progressives in a way that simply wasn't possible in previous years.

However, Nixon will also have to convince voters that she's capable of serving as the chief executive of the nation's fourth-largest state with a $163 billion budget. There's also a third Democrat running, former state Sen. Terry Gipson, who could siphon off precious votes if he remains in the race. Cuomo, whatever his liabilities, is the heavy favorite to win the primary, and if he succeeds, to secure a third term against whomever the GOP puts forth in November.

â— OK-Gov: The New York Times recently reported that Scott Pruitt is the subject of speculation he might launch a last-minute campaign to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Mary Fallin in Oklahoma, where he previously served as state attorney general from 2011 to 2017. Pruitt is currently Trump's notoriously anti-science head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and he has turned the agency on its head by protecting polluters while fighting climate regulations.

However, that record may not be much of a negative in deeply conservative Oklahoma, where the fossil fuel industry looms large over the state's economy. Pruitt himself hasn't said anything about his intentions, but a spokesperson said he's focused on his current job, which isn't a ""no."" Regardless, the filing deadline is April 13, so we'll know soon enough whether he runs.

â— WY-Gov: Businessman Sam Galeotos had previously filed to join the GOP primary for governor, and he now reportedly plans to announce he's running on Wednesday. Galeotos is the executive chairman of a data services company and has the backing of former state party chair Matt Micheli, although he doesn't appear to have run for office before.

House

â— AZ-02: Former Sen. Dennis DeConcini, the last Democrat elected to the Senate in Arizona, just endorsed former state Rep. Matt Heinz in his bid for the state's open 2nd Congressional District. Heinz is an underdog in the Democratic primary against former Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, but interestingly, DeConcini backed Kirkpatrick's surprise bid for the Senate last cycle very early on, when other Democrats were still considering the race.

â— CA-10: Rep. Jackie Speier, who represents California's 14th Congressional District, has endorsed former Riverbank Mayor Virginia Madueno. Speier's seat on the San Francisco Peninsula is just two districts over from the 10th, though geographically and culturally, the seats are very different from one another. Madueno is one of several Democrats hoping to oust GOP Rep. Jeff Denham.

â— IA-03: On Monday, Iowa's secretary of state's office announced that real estate company president Theresa Greenfield did not submit enough valid signatures to make the June Democratic ballot. Greenfield said afterwards that she would spend the next few days ""talking to all of those incredible people who support my candidacy and gauge their support for a path forward."" It is possible Greenfield could seek legal action or mount a write-in campaign, though she didn't say what she was considering.

Until this recent turn of events, Greenfield had arguably been the frontrunner in the primary to take on GOP Rep. David Young. Greenfield handed her petitions in on Wednesday, but two days later, she announced that her campaign manager, Noah Wasserman, had told her the night before that he had forged an unknown number of signatures.

Greenfield says that she fired Wasserman on the spot before she decided to collect all 1,790 signatures all over again on Friday, which was the day they were due. Remarkably, Greenfield's lightning-fast signature gathering campaign was helped by the campaigns of governor candidates Fred Hubbell, John Norris, Nate Boulton, Andy McGuire, and Cathy Glasson. Even Pete D'Alessandro, a longtime party operative who is also running in the 3rd District, lent a hand.

Greenfield didn't have time to count her petitions before she turned them in at the last possible second, and according to the secretary of state, she fell 198 signatures short. Iowa Starting Line's Pat Rynard says that if Greenfield had chosen to do nothing about her original signatures, the state's verification process probably wouldn't have even uncovered any forgeries. However, Greenfield said over the weekend, before she knew if she'd make the ballot or not, that she decided she ""was not going to get on the ballot with forged signatures.""

For at least the moment, only three Democrats are on the June ballot: D'Alessandro, business consultant Cindy Axne, and insurance company owner Eddie Mauro. One other candidate, former U.S. Treasury Department economist Austin Frerick, dropped out just before the deadline. If no one takes at least 35 percent of the vote in the primary, a party convention will pick the nominee. If there are only three candidates competing in June, it's considerably more likely that the Democratic nomination will be decided in the primary.

â— ME-02: GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin won an expensive contest last cycle as his northern Maine seat swung from 53-44 Obama to 51-41 Trump, but Democrats are going to target him again. Four candidates are running in the June primary, and, as we discussed above in our ME-Gov item, the nomination will be decided through instant-runoff voting.

The two main Democratic candidates appear to be businessman Lucas St. Clair and state Rep. Jared Golden. St. Clair, who is close to conservation groups, became well-known for successfully securing federal recognition for former timberland in Maine's North Woods as a national monument. St. Clair was widely credited for convincing initially skeptical local residents to back the project.

Golden, meanwhile, is a Marine veteran who entered the race with a strong announcement video, and he has the support of VoteVets. While Golden's opening fundraising quarter was a bit sluggish, he improved quite a bit at the end of the year. At the end of December, Golden held a $182,000 to $140,000 cash-on-hand edge over St. Clair.

The other two Democrats businessman Jonathan Fulford, who narrowly lost tough state Senate races in 2014 and 2016, and local bookseller Craig Olson. Fulford had $76,000 on-hand at the end of the year, while Olson, who has mainly been self-funding, had $61,000. In October, a poll of the primary for an unnamed group gave St. Clair the lead with 40 percent of the vote, while the other three Democrats were in the single digits.

â— MN-08: MinnPost recently took a look at which candidates running for the Democratic nomination to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan say will or won't abide by the result of the April 14 party convention. Former FBI analyst Leah Phifer, North Branch Mayor Kirsten Kennedy, and former state Rep. Joe Radinovich all say they will abide by the convention outcome and drop out if they don't win the party's endorsement.

However, state Rep. Jason Metsa and retired Duluth news anchor Michelle Lee both would not commit to ending their campaigns if they lose at the convention. Consequently, we may still end up seeing a contested primary for this ancestrally Democratic Iron Range-based seat, which backed Trump 54-39.

â— ND-AL: Even though he only entered the race for North Dakota's open at-large congressional seat earlier this month, former state Senate Minority Leader Mac Schneider won a dominant victory at the state Democratic Party's convention on Saturday, earning the support of 61 percent of delegates. That prompted state Sen. John Grabinger, who took a distant third with just 5 percent, to drop out and back Schneider. However, the second-place finisher, former state Rep. Ben Hanson (who captured 34 percent of the vote), did not rule out continuing on to the June 12 primary, though the West Fargo Pioneer notes that all three candidates ""wrapped their arms around each other"" on stage after Schneider secured the endorsement.

Schneider also secured the backing of former Rep. Earl Pomeroy, the last Democrat to hold this seat before losing in the 2010 Republican wave. Schneider had previously served as press secretary to Pomeroy, who declared, ""We fought the political battles together. Through it all, I always knew one thing: Big Mac had my back."" Now Pomeroy has Big Mac's back, too.

Meanwhile, the fight for the GOP nomination is chiefly a contest between two men: state Sens. Kelly Armstrong, who resigned as state party chair to run, and Tom Campbell. Republicans will hold their convention from April 6-8, though as with the Democrats, it may not determine their nominee.

â— NJ-05: It's been a while since we've written about the June GOP primary to face freshman Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer and well â€¦ let's just say that Steve Lonegan won't be standing down in his war against the party establishment anytime soon. Attorney John McCann's allies control the county party in Bergen, which makes up 72 percent of this competitive seat, and they're going to give McCann the all-important county organization line.

Lonegan, a movement conservative who has lost several high-profile races over the years, is not happy, and he declared that McCann and Bergen GOP chair Paul DiGaetano ""are in bed with the Democrats."" He went on, ""It's either corrupt, Democrat Party politics or a party based on conservative principals. The people will decide."" Lonegan also referenced McCann's attempts to paint him as a loser, saying, ""He runs around saying 'Lonegan lost, Lonegan lost,' but I took on big battles. I defeated Cory Booker in the 5th District."" Lonegan did indeed carry this seat in his 2013 Senate bid, but by just a 50-49 spread.

However, while local party elites may not like him, Lonegan does have one big potential advantage over McCann. At the end of December, Lonegan had a $1 million to $129,000 cash-on-hand edge; the vast majority of the money each Republican has brought in has come from his own wallet, but Lonegan's wallet was obviously a lot fatter. Gottheimer has always been a strong fundraiser, and he ended the year with $2.6 million in the bank.

â— NJ-07: While businessman Craig Heard recently formed an exploratory committee for a potential GOP primary bid against Rep. Leonard Lance, he has announced he'll back the congressman rather than run himself.

â— NJ-08: Hudson County Democrats are involved in a nasty local war, and it could spill over into the June primary for New Jersey's safely blue 8th District. Insider NJ's Max Pizarro reports that Hudson County Freeholder Tilo Rivas is not only considering challenging Rep. Albio Sires, but that he's going to take out petitions this week. The candidate filing deadline is April 2, so we won't be in suspense for long.

Sires and Rivas are on opposite sides in the conflict for control of Hudson County, which makes up about 60 percent of this district. Rivas is a close ally of Union City Mayor Brian Stack, who is set to become county party chair in June, while Sires is tight with Hudson County Executive Tom DeGise. Stack and Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop have announced that they won't back DeGise in his 2019 re-election campaign, but DeGise has declared he's running for a fifth term anyway, and has Sires' support.

As part of this internecine battle, Pizarro writes that pro-Stack forces have been looking for someone to take on Sires this year, and while there was some speculation that Fulop would do it, he's reportedly said no. But Rivas, who is also a Union City commissioner, seems to have emerged as their candidate.

â— NV-02: GOP Rep. Mark Amodei had sounded very meh about running for re-election for months, but he did indeed file to seek another term. Amodei faces a well-known primary challenge from former state Assemblywoman Sharron Angle, whose notorious 2010 Senate campaign helped secure Democrat Harry Reid one last term.

However, Angle's glory days, such as they were, seem to be far behind her. Angle ran for the Senate again in 2016 and lost the primary to establishment favorite Joe Heck 65-23. This bid looks no better: She had less than $4,000 in the bank at the end of 2017.

This northern Nevada seat went from 53-45 Romney to 52-40 Trump, and it could be in play in a Democratic wave year. However, Team Blue may just not have a candidate strong enough to ride a wave to victory. Clint Koble, who served as a state-level Department of Agriculture official during the Obama administration, entered the race in mid-November, but he had less than $1,000 in the bank at the end of the year.

â— NV-03: Democratic freshman Rep. Jacky Rosen is leaving to run for the Senate, and both parties are going to work hard to win her suburban Las Vegas seat, which very narrowly backed both Obama and Trump. Local and national Democrats very quickly consolidated behind wealthy education activist and philanthropist Susie Lee, who faces no serious primary opposition and had a hefty $601,000 in the bank at the end of last year.

The Republican primary, by contrast, is as chaotic as the Democrats' is placid. There was a huge last-minute development on the GOP side on Friday when perennial candidate Danny Tarkanian dropped his primary bid against Sen. Dean Heller and announced that he would once again seek this seat. Tarkanian has unsuccessfully run for office five times now (six if you count his aborted bid against Heller), but his wealth and family nameâ€”his late father was the legendary UNLV basketball coach Jerry Tarkanianâ€”have elevated him above the rank of Some Dude.

And powered by his belligerent brand of conservatism, Tarkanian defeated state Senate Majority Leader Michael Roberson, the choice of the GOP establishment, in the primary for the 3rd District last cycle. Tarkanian ended up narrowly losing to Rosen 47-46 as Trump was taking this seat 48-47.

For the other Republicans who were already running here, Tarkanian's campaign has almost certainly made all their lives harder. In the mix are state Sen. Scott Hammond, former local TV news reporter Michelle Mortensen, former Clark County party chairman Dave McKeon (a son of former California Rep. Buck McKeon), and former Assemblywoman Victoria Seaman. Two Republican operatives (one local, one national) each anonymously told the Washington Examiner that they'd prefer either Hammond or Mortensen.

But despite his huge flaws, it may be very hard to stop Tarkanian from claiming the GOP nomination again, especially in this crowded field. Tarkanian is not only well-known, but he got Trump's blessing when he switched races in the form of a tweet reading, ""It would be great for the Republican Party of Nevada, and it's unity if good guy Danny Tarkanian would run for Congress and Dean Heller, who is doing a really good job, could run for Senate unopposed!""

Tarkanian also will likely have a huge financial edge in the primary. Tarkanian's Senate campaign had $451,000 on-hand at the end of December. By contrast, the best-funded candidate of the rest of the lot was Seaman, who has $139,000 available. None of the others had more than $80,000 to spend.

â— NV-04: Freshman Democratic Rep. Ruben Kihuen decided to retire late last year after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment, and despite reports suggesting that he might do so, he thankfully did not change his mind before the Friday filing deadline.

Republicans became very interested in targeting this seat after Kihuen's career started to self-destruct, and former Rep. Cresent Hardy faces minimal primary opposition. Hardy won this seat in a 2014 surprise against Democrat Steven Horsford, and he lost to Kihuen 49-45 last cycle as Clinton was carrying this seat by a similar margin. He initially declined a comeback bid but changed his mind after this seat became open.

Things are more crowded on the Democratic side. Horsford is looking to avenge himself for his 2014 loss, and he starts out as the frontrunner in the primary. Horsford likely still has plenty of name recognition from his one term in the House, and perhaps more importantly, the powerful Culinary Union reportedly plans to support him. (Horsford used to be CEO of their training academy.) However, Horsford has acknowledged that his family lives in Northern Virginia, and he's predicted he would be criticized for this choice.

State Sen. Pat Spearman is also in, and she does have some experience winning tough primaries. Spearman, who is a gay Army veteran and minister, made her first run for office in 2012 in a primary against conservative state Sen. John Lee in a safely blue seat around North Las Vegas. Lee decisively outspent her, and even Spearman's allies doubted she had much of a chance, but she unseated the incumbent 63-37.

University of Nevada Regent Allison Stephens, who, like Horsford and Spearman, is black, kicked off a campaign last week. Stephens, who is also one of the state's two Democratic National Committee members, is probably the least known of the three, but she may have the connections to run a serious race. Wrapping up the notable candidates, there's Medicare-for-all advocate Amy Vilela, who was challenging Kihuen in his primary before his scandal and has gotten some media attention. Vilela only had $33,000 on-hand at the end of 2017, but if she can get her name out, she may be able to win if she can do well with Hispanic voters.

â— NY-12: Just gross. Longtime Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who faces an unusually well-funded primary challenge from businessman Suraj Patel, scoffed to BuzzFeed in a new interview that her opponent's fundraising reports show ""mainly a huge amount of the name Patel, which is his name."" Like many Indian-American candidates, Patel has indeed been successful in raising money from other members of the Indian-American community, many of whom also share his last nameâ€”which is one of the most common Indian surnames.

Ethnic affinities have always played a role in American politics, and particularly for members of minority groups, the opportunity to support candidates from your own community is often a point of pride. For Maloney to make any of this sound sketchy or even shameful is tremendously dismaying.

Patel shot back sharply, saying, ""I guess I didn't realize Rep. Maloney hired Steve Bannon as her campaign strategist"" and noting that Donald Trump had once donated to the congresswoman. Maloney will still be hard to beat, but since first winning office, she's never faced a truly competitive race, and if she gets in the habit of making more unforced errors like this one, she might wind up making things a contest.

â— NY-25: It's only been a few days since Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter died, and understandably, potential candidates aren't in a hurry to talk about whether they'll run to succeed her. It's also not clear whether Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo will schedule a special election, much less when, for the final months of Slaughter's term. However, the April 12 filing deadline for the regularly scheduled June primary is not very far away, so local politicians will need to decide what they'll do before too long. This seat, which is based in the Rochester area, backed Obama 59-39 and Clinton by a similar 56-39 margin and should remain blue without much trouble.

Speculation quickly began that Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren could seek the Democratic nod, though she said Friday, hours after Slaughter's death was announced, that it wasn't the right time to talk about running. Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Morelle and Assemblyman Harry Bronson also declined to talk about whether they were interested. Politico also mentions Monroe County Clerk Adam Bello, former television journalist Rachel Barnhart, and Brighton Supervisor Bill Moehle as possibilities, though we've heard nothing from any of them. However, former Lt. Gov. Robert Duffy, who used to be Rochester's mayor, said he wouldn't run.

On the Republican side, local party leaders consolidated behind James Maxwell, the chief of neurosurgery at Rochester General Hospital, before Slaughter died. The chair of the Monroe County GOP told Politico on Friday that his organizations remained committed to Maxwell. (Monroe is the only county in the seat.) Gates Town Supervisor Mark Assini had ruled out a bid in January, but he declined to say on Friday whether he was reconsidering. Assini lost to Slaughter by just 871 votes in a shock 2014 squeaker, but she beat him 56-44 in their rematch two years later. Local political science professor Jim Bowers mentions Monroe County Executive Cheryl Dinolfo as another possibility, but there's no sign she's considering.

â— OH-16: Former football star Anthony Gonzalez recently debuted his first TV ad ahead of the Republican primary to succeed outgoing GOP Rep. Jim Renacci in this northeastern Ohio seat. The spot highlights Gonzalez's background, noting how his father's side of the family fled Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba, and how he achieved success playing football for the Ohio State University and in the NFL. Gonzalez also emphasizes his business experience and pitches himself as a problem-solver.

â— OK-01: Democrats haven't won a Tulsa-based House seat since former Rep. James Jones last won re-election all the way back in 1984, but Democrat Tim Gilpin's recent decision to join the race at least gives the party a notable candidate for 2018. Gilpin heads a personal injury and labor law firm, and he previously served on the state Board of Education and as an assistant state attorney general, so he may have some decent connections in state politics.

This district backed Trump by a brutal 61-33, so Republicans are heavily favored in November. However, Gilpin is hoping to score an upset thanks to GOP Rep. Jim Bridenstine's retirement this year. Oklahoma has also been seeing an ongoing backlash at the ballot box against unpopular Republican Gov. Mary Fallin's harsh education budget cuts, which have forced many school systems to operate just four days a week while class sizes have skyrocketed.

â— PA-05: State Rep. Margo Davidson has jumped into the Democratic primary for the new Delaware County-based 5th District, but Democrats are unlikely be to be enthusiastic about her. In the span of a month earlier this year, Davidson was twice charged with crashing her taxpayer-funded vehicle while her license was suspended. Police said in January that she drove away from the scene after rear-ending a vehicle without providing the legally required documents where the crash took place. And even before that, Davidson only won renomination 54-46 in 2016 after casting some unpopular votes in favor of abortion restrictions and school vouchers.

The primary for this new, safely blue seat has grown incredibly crowded, but the last Democrat to represent this area in the House has made his preference known. Former Rep. Joe Sestak endorsed attorney George Badey, who was the 2012 nominee for the old Delaware County-based 7th District and currently serves as the Radnor Township Democratic committee chair.

â— PA-06: Republican Rep. Ryan Costello had been publicly refusing to rule out retirement following the GOP's special election loss in Pennsylvania's old 18th District last week, but he now says he'll file petitions that would allow him to seek a third term in the 6th District when the filing period ends on Tuesday.

This development would seemingly give the GOP a big break after this redrawn Chester County-based district swerved left, going from a narrow from 48.2-47.6 margin for Hillary Clinton to a much wider 53-43 win thanks to court-ordered redistricting. However, Costello did not actually say he's running for re-election, only that he's ""filing my petition,"" and as ABC News' Emily Goodin relays, anonymous insiders aren't certain Costello will end up sticking things out in the tougher seat.

If Costello won the nomination and then decided to drop out at least 85 days before the November general election, the GOP could pick a new nominee. But Republicans would almost certainly would have a much harder time holding this blue-leaning district without an incumbent on the ballot in a midterm environment that's favoring Democrats, especially if their candidate had limited time to prepare a campaign.

â— PA Redistricting: On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the GOP's effort to block Pennsylvania's new court-drawn congressional map, and a federal district court did the same. Consequently, the districts drawn by the state Supreme Court to promote partisan fairness will now definitely be the ones used for the 2018 elections, replacing one of the most extreme Republican gerrymanders ever drawn in the modern era.

The candidate filing period ends at 5 PM ET on Tuesday, and we'll take an extensive look at everyone running in each of the newly redrawn districts soon. In the meantime, you can find our calculations of the key electoral results, demographic stats, and more for the new map here.

â— UT-03: GOP Rep. John Curtis will face a familiar opponent for renomination in this very red Provo-area seat. Former state Rep. Chris Herrod, who lost a special election primary to Curtis 43-33 last year, will oppose the incumbent at the April party convention. Utah law allows candidates to also collect signatures to reach the June primary ballot in case the convention doesn't go well for them, an option only Curtis has decided to exercise. Last year, Herrod pulled off a surprise win at the convention, but he fell far short in the primary a few months later.

â— UT-04: GOP Rep. Mia Love is facing a very well-known Democratic opponent in this suburban Salt Lake City seat: Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams, who represents about 85 percent of the 4th District and kicked off a bid in October. At the end of 2017, Love held a modest $576,000 to $460,000 cash-on-hand edge over McAdams. Local pollster Dan Jones &amp; Associates has surveyed this race three times and has consistently given Love a 5- or 6-point edge.

Love has been a tough candidate to get a read on. In 2012, Utah Republicans chewed up Democratic Rep. Jim Matheson's House seat in redistricting in an effort to beat him, and Love gave him his most serious challenge in years. Indeed, by the end of the race, it looked like Mitt Romney's coattails would be too much for Matheson to overcome, but he pulled off a surprise 48.9-48.5 win over Love even as Romney took the seat 67-30.

Matheson opted to retire in 2014, and for almost a year, it seemed that Love, who decided to run a second time, would win this seat without much of a fight. However, Democrat Doug Owens kept things unexpectedly close despite the GOP wave and lost just 51-46. There's always been the uncomfortable possibility that some conservative voters weren't voting for Love because she's black, but 2016 did finally give Love a clear and decisive victory. Owens tried again, and while national Democrats gave him much more attention in his second attempt, Love won their rematch 54-41. Donald Trump carried this seat 39-32, while conservative independent Evan McMullin took 22 percent.

4:55 p.m.

A source close to the investigation says a mass shooting during a video game tournament at a Jacksonville, Florida, riverfront mall has left four people dead.

The source says the person who opened fire died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The source spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to release information on the shooting. It wasn't immediately clear if the source was including the suspect in the death toll.

Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said at a news conference Sunday afternoon that the suspect, a white male whose identity authorities are still seeking to confirm, had died. He did not elaborate, but said the shooting site had since been secured.

Several other people were taken to hospitals.

Sounds of the shooting were captured as the gaming tournament was being livestreamed.

Florida authorities say they've finished clearing the scene of a fatal mass shooting at a riverfront mall in Jacksonville and there are no additional suspects.

Speaking to reporters Sunday afternoon, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams says a suspect is dead at the scene and they are still working to identify the male.

The sheriff's office says the shooting, which erupted during a video game tournament, has left multiple dead and sent others to the hospital. Williams did not give any details on the number of people killed or wounded.

4:45 p.m.

It didn't take long for some Democratic candidates for governor to issue statements on a mass shooting in Jacksonville that left multiple people dead.

In the wake of the Feb. 14 Parkland school shooting that left 17 dead, gun violence has been a major issue ahead of Tuesday's primary election, in which voters will pick the Republican and Democratic nominees to replace outgoing Republican Gov. Rick Scott.

Former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham sent an email to supporters that said the only way to end mass shootings is to ""vote out the politicians complicit in this cycle of death.""

Former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine also released a statement saying, ""I am horrified and I am furious"" and that it's time for new leaders.

Video game manufacturer Electronic Arts tweeted, ""This is a horrible situation, and our deepest sympathies go out to all involved.""

Florida authorities say one suspect is dead at the scene after a fatal mass shooting at a riverfront mall in Jacksonville.

But on its Twitter feed, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office says it's unknown at this time if there's a second suspect and searches are being conducted.

The sheriff's office says multiple people have been killed in the shooting.

The department says to ""stay far away from the area. The area is not safe at this time. STAY AWAY."" They also warned news media to stay away from the area, which contains restaurants and shops along the St. Johns River.

3OREP8RUT3TFT2C20WCU5BWFWECBGP,Childish Gambino's This Is America in plagiarism debate,"Image copyright Getty Images

Fans are debating whether Childish Gambino's This is America was copied from another song.

Over the weekend someone on Reddit compared the hit with a 2016 track by Jase Harley - sparking a big debate.

The rapper in question has since posted on Instagram saying he too thinks his track was Childish Gambino's inspiration.

But a screen grab of a now-deleted tweet by Gambino's manager seems to show him denying plagiarism.

Image copyright Childish Gambino/YouTube Image caption The video for This is America deals with police brutality and gun violence

This is America was released earlier this year and has since made the top 10 in the UK and number one in the US, while the video has been watched 300m times on YouTube alone.

It talks about black oppression, police brutality and gun violence in America.

But fans have been arguing online about whether it's too similar to another track, which was released in 2016.

The rapper in question - Jase Harley - says he, too, thinks there are similarities.

""I feel extremely humbled to be recognised and labelled as one of, or the original inspiration, for one of the most important pieces of music and visual art of our time,"" he posted on Instagram.

""I appreciate all the love and support! But please don't let this controversy dilute the message me and Childish Gambino are trying to convey.""

He also implies that he has no interest in taking legal action - and that he'd be happy with a ""shout out"".

You can read his full statement below.

Childish Gambino's manager, Fam Rothstein, also looks like he's got involved.

In a tweet that's since been deleted, but that was screen-grabbed by websites including ABC, he appears to claim that This is America is older than American Pharaoh.

""The internet is a place of no consequences,"" the tweet says. ""This song is three years old and we have Pro Tools [music editing software] files to prove it.""

Another deleted tweet posted from his account a few minutes later appears to say his words should be taken as an official ""comment from the label"".

Newsbeat has contacted representatives for Childish Gambino for comment.

3QHITW7OYPR1NH1OXEHA4EGBK54AQ0,Ask Publix and Mozilla founder why dark money shouldn't be outlawed,"CLOSE Dark-money groups are non-profit organizations that can spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. Here's how. Wochit

The right to be involved in politics without revealing your name, protects democracy. Who says? The Supreme Court.

Demonstrators lie on the floor at a Publix Supermarket in Coral Springs, Fla., Friday, May 25, 2018. Students from the Florida high school where 17 people were shot and killed earlier this year did a ""die in"" protest at the supermarket chain that backs a gubernatorial candidate allied with the National Rifle Association. Shortly before the the ""die-in"" Publix announced that is will suspend political donations. (Mike Stocker/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP) (Photo: Mike Stocker, AP)

In 2014, Brendan Eich was a tech superstar. The Silicon Valley company he had helped create, Mozilla, had just promoted him to CEO. Within days, Eich was hounded so fiercely that he resigned.

The reason for his professional demise? A $1,000 political donation he had made several years earlier.

Eich had given the money to Californiaâ€™s 2008 Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California. Courts had since struck down the successful voter initiative, but progressive mobs were in no mood to forgive or forget.

It's how activists hammer opposition

With the rise of social media and ever more aggressive protests, this pattern has become the norm. Private individuals and companies are regularly targeted for disagreeing with mobs from both the left and the right. One wrong move and angry activists will demand an employee be fired or a company be boycotted.

It's no wonder that many citizens would prefer to keep their political donations private. But privacy wonâ€™t be an option if a new Arizona initiative is approved.

Officially known as the â€œStop Political Dirty Money Amendment,â€ if passed, the voter-driven effort will mandate the disclosure of political donors.

Former state Attorney General Terry Goddard submitted more than 285,000 signatures last month, about 25,000 more than required. As usual, thereâ€™s a court battle over whether enough of the signatures are valid. If organizers meet the high bar, voters will decide on the measure in November.

Constitutional change would be hard to undo

The amendment would add 1,500 words to the Arizona Constitution requiring any group attempting to influence a state election to reveal the identities of donors. Any non-profit spending more than $10,000 in a two-year election cycle must disclose every person who contributed at least $2,500.

The language also exposes ""chain donations,'' where one group gives money to a second group and then perhaps to a third. All the money needs to be traced back to the source, whether itâ€™s a big company pushing an agenda or a publicity-shy retiree quietly helping a cause she believes in.

Since this is proposed as a constitutional amendment, lawmakers wouldnâ€™t be able to alter the byzantine regulations without voter approval. If any phrasing is unclear or misinterpreted, Arizona is quite likely stuck with it.

Measure would chill political involvement

An understandable fear of â€œdirty moneyâ€ opponents is the claim that money buys elections. To disprove this, one needs only to look at the 2016 presidential race. Clinton outspent Trump by nearly 2 to 1. If you include allied organizations, Democratic groups significantly outspent Republican ones. Nevertheless, Trump prevailed.

Though perhaps a well-intentioned drive for transparency, these 1,500 words of legalese do little but make government more intrusive and complex. It also will chill political involvement.

In fact, the terms â€œdark moneyâ€ and â€œdirty moneyâ€ portray private donations as inherently bad. But in this era of mob justice and personal retribution, privacy is critical for anyone seeking to engage in the political process.

More: Why Gov. Eric Greitens' resignation should make us worry about dark money

Tax credits for small donors in politics should be part of tax reform

Even Trump and Clinton need big-money donors: Column

In May, gun control advocate David Hogg organized â€œdie insâ€ at Publix grocery stores because the company gave money to a candidate endorsed by the NRA. Hogg didnâ€™t know or care that the Florida-based company had given more than $760,000 to Democratic committees since 2008, much of that money promoting candidates who strongly oppose the NRA.

Not wanting the disruption of protests and counter-protests, Publix suspended political donations of any kind. They removed themselves entirely from the political debate and both sides lost.

Goddard, et al., might not like it, but the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that political donations are covered under the First Amendmentâ€™s free speech protections.

Just as Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay could anonymously write The Federalist Papers under the pen name â€œPublius,â€ Arizonans should be able to contribute to their pet issue without being exposed by government officials.

Both sides stand to lose if this passes

As the Publix case showed, activists on both sides will lose with this new amendment.

Would an up-and-coming lawyer working at a conservative firm want to give money to the ACLU or Planned Parenthood if he knows his political views will be outed to the partners? Would a restaurateur in a liberal community risk donating to the NRA or a traditional religious organization?

We only need to see what happened to Chick-fil-A to answer that question.

In a 1995 decision on political speech, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote, â€œanonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority.â€ He was exactly right.

If this amendment were to take effect, it would invite harassment, dilute political dialogue and chill both free speech and free association.

Ironically, the most prominent link on the Outlaw Dirty Money website is the donate button. If organizers succeed in their effort, Arizonans will be less likely to ever donate at all.

3YGYP13642R8J1ADJXBFVAAGF7DRNS,"California lawmakers approve tougher restrictions on firearms possession, report says","Lawmakers in California on Monday sent three bills to Gov. Jerry Brownâ€™s desk that call for stricter restrictions on firearms in a state that has one of the toughest gun laws in the country.

The bill was sent to Brownâ€™s desk one day after a gunman opened fire at a gaming event in Florida, killing two before turning the gun on himself.

The Los Angeles Times reported that the bills call for a lifetime ban for those convicted of domestic violence along with those ordered by a court to a psychiatric hold twice in one year.

State lawmakers have also called for Californians interested in obtaining a concealed weapon permit to undergo eight hours of instruction and pass a live-fire test before being granted the permit, the report said.

Most Republicans opposed the concealed-carry measure, warning that there is no limit on the amount of training a county can demand for the permit under the proposed law.

The state is known to have tight gun laws. Those convicted of domestic violence in the state currently face a 10-year probation, the report said. The state also currently enforces a five-year ban for those ordered by a court into a psychiatric holds, the report said.

31MBOZ6PAP9EPZI9PN55TN75AGYLCC,Obituary: John McCain,"Image copyright Getty Images

John McCain was the Vietnam war hero who became one of America's most high-profile politicians.

His brand of common-sense conservatism often saw him clash with his Republican allies and he was a fierce critic of the presidency of Donald Trump.

He gained a reputation for being a dealmaker, someone who was prepared to compromise to get the job done.

But he failed to win the 2008 presidential election, facing criticism from some quarters for his choice of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate.

John Sidney McCain III was born on 29 Aug 1936 at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone, an area then under US control. Naval service was in his blood, both his father and grandfather ending their naval careers as four star admirals.

His father's various postings saw the young McCain attending a host of different schools before he enrolled in the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland.

There he established a reputation for leadership, coupled with a fine disdain for authority. The latter trait, along with his propensity to do just enough to achieve grades in subjects he found boring, saw him graduate in 1958 near the bottom of his class.

He moved on to Pensacola in Florida, dubbed the cradle of naval aviation where, after a two-and-a-half year course, he left with his pilot's qualifications and a reputation as a party animal.

Rolling Thunder

He wasn't the most competent of flyers. While still under training he crashed a plane into the sea, leading him to be dubbed ""cocky, occasionally cavalier and prone to testing limits"".

""John was what they call a push-the-envelope guy,"" was the verdict of one of the pilots who flew with him.

After being assigned to fly Skyraider aircraft from a US carrier in the Mediterranean he flew his plane into electrical wires in Spain, causing a power failure in the surrounding area.

In 1967 he was transferred to the US carrier Forrestal which was engaged in the operation dubbed ""Rolling Thunder"" - the sustained bombing of North Vietnam. Following a fire on the Forrestal, in which he was injured, he transferred to the USS Oriskany.

On 26 Oct 1967 he was shot down while flying a mission over Hanoi. Badly injured - having fractured both arms and a leg when he ejected - he was captured by North Vietnamese troops.

He was refused all but the most rudimentary medical care, and interrogated under torture. The beatings only stopped when the North Vietnamese discovered he was the son of an admiral. In March 1968, he was placed in solitary confinement where he remained for two years.

Badly injured

When his father became commander of US forces in Vietnam, his captors - sensing a propaganda opportunity - offered to release him. McCain refused unless every US prisoner captured before him was released first.

His captors restarted the brutal torture regime to the extent that McCain, beaten and suffering from dysentery, attempted suicide. He was eventually released after five and half years in captivity, but with lasting injuries.

He returned to find his wife Carol, whom he had married in 1965, had been badly injured in a car accident which had left her disfigured.

A spell at the Navy's liaison office to the US Senate in 1977 kindled an interest in politics. He also began dating a teacher, Cindy Lou Hensley, whom he married in 1980 after his first wife had granted him a divorce.

Keen gambler

In 1981 he quit the Navy and set out to run for Congress, winning a seat in Phoenix, Arizona, where his new father-in-law ran a beer distribution company.

He was a strong supporter of the then-president, Ronald Reagan, including favouring a hard line against the Soviet Union and the backing of the Contras in Nicaragua.

Re-elected to Congress with an overwhelming majority in 1984, he was asked to serve on the influential House Foreign Affairs Committee, which further raised his profile.

In 1987, he entered the Senate to represent Arizona, replacing the arch-conservative Barry Goldwater who had retired. His expertise in the Navy led to a seat on the Senate Armed Forces Committee.

He also served on the Indian Affairs Committee where, as a keen gambler himself, he pushed through new laws that allowed native Americans to generate revenue from casinos.

McCain had already established a reputation of not being afraid to challenge his own party leadership. He caused a stir when he twice supported President Clinton's nominees for the Supreme Court, judging them to be the best people for the job.

In the early 90s, the new senator was involved in a corruption scandal after he and four Democratic senators were accused of trying to intimidate regulators on behalf of a campaign donor who eventually served prison time for corrupt management practices.

He received a mild warning after an investigation found he ""exercised poor judgment in intervening with the regulators"" but that his actions ""were not improper"".

Bitter campaign

McCain announced he was running for the Republican nomination for president in September 1999.

He pitched himself as the anti-establishment candidate against fellow candidate, Texas Governor George W Bush, who could rely on most of the support - and the money - from the party hierarchy.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption He was forced out of the race for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination

In what became a bitter campaign, Bush proved adept at harnessing the support of the Christian right and McCain, after a heavy defeat on so-called Super Tuesday, quit the race in March 2000.

While he pledged his support for Bush, McCain characteristically showed he was not afraid to criticise the new president. He was one of only two Republican senators to vote against tax cuts and also opposed the president's policies on gun control.

However, after the 9/11 attacks he supported Bush's war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq, although as the latter operation dragged on, he began to question the Bush strategy and the policies of the US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld.

Poor performances

In April 2007, McCain announced he would again run for president and fought off a strong challenge from New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and the Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination.

Mindful of his need to attract support from conservative Christians, he surprised everyone by announcing virtually unknown Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, as his running mate.

Image copyright Getty Images

But while Palin's hockey mum persona was welcomed by the right, mainstream voters began to question her lack of experience and a series of poor performances in TV interviews cast doubts on the credibility of the Republican campaign.

Outspent by the Obama campaign, and carrying the legacy of eight years of a Bush presidency, McCain lost both the electoral college and the popular vote and Obama entered the White House.

Unusually, the relationship between the two men seemed to blossom after the election and Obama often consulted McCain. However, the senator came out strongly in opposition to the new president's plans to stimulate the economy, claiming it was money spent to no useful purpose.

Good wishes

Back in Arizona, he fought off a challenge by a Tea Party candidate and easily retained his Senate seat in the 2010 elections. His profile in the Senate remained high and his regular appearances on US TV maintained his position as one of the best known politicians in the US.

When Republicans began selecting their presidential candidate for the 2016 election, McCain expressed grave doubts over Donald Trump's suitability for the job, once referring to a roomful of Trump supporters as ""crazies"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption As he entered his ninth decade he was still active in the Senate

The relationship between the two men took a further knock when Trump criticised McCain's war record.

""He's not a war hero,"" Trump opined. ""He's a war hero because he was captured? I like people who weren't captured.""

McCain withdrew his support for Trump in October 2016, the day after a 2005 recording emerged of Trump making obscene remarks about women and appearing to admit to sexual assault.

""When Mr Trump attacks women and demeans the women in our nation and in our society, that is a point where I just have to part company,"" he said.

However, Trump, along with Barack Obama, was among the first to offer good wishes to McCain when, in July 2017, it was announced that he was suffering with a brain tumour.

The same month - while sporting a scar over his left eye after surgery for a blood clot - he dramatically used a ""thumbs down"" to vote against a Republican health care repeal bill.

The president tweeted that McCain, and other senators who voted against the bill, had ""let the American people down"".

John McCain's determination to plot his own political course, regardless of the party line, probably explains why he never reached the highest office in US politics.

But he was seen as a man of principle, someone happy to sit down with his political opponents if there was a compromise to be reached.

3JYPJ2TAYJQBJWHH8HODIA1SCPVPF1,"Trump critic Sen. Sasse says he's considering leaving Republican Party, calls WH a â€˜reality showâ€™","Sen. Ben Sasse reiterated on Sunday that he frequently considers leaving the Republican Party and is tired of the partisan gridlock inside the Washington Beltway.

Sasse, R-Neb., a deeply conservative lawmaker who has been a frequent critic of the Trump White House, said that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have â€œa future for the countryâ€ and that both are more focused on stymieing the other than passing actual legislation.

â€œThe main thing the Democrats are for is being Anti-Republican and Anti-Trump,â€ Sasse said on NBC's â€œMeet the Press.â€ â€œThe main thing the Republicans are for is being Anti-Democrat.â€

When asked about how frequently he considers leaving the Republican Party, Sasse said he thinks â€œabout it every dayâ€ and added that the Republican Party today bears little resemblance to the â€œparty of Lincoln and Reagan.â€

Sasseâ€™s comments come a day after the Nebraska lawmaker responded to a question posed to him on Twitter.

The commenter said she believed changing her Democratic affiliation to ""no-party"" would be ""part of the solution"" and then asked the first-term senator whether he might follow suit.

His response: ""yep â€” regularly consider it (except the 'from Dem' part)""

Just before that, Sasse wrote of his fear that ""we're headed toward a place where hefty majorities of both sides of the electorate are going to regularly embrace unsupported and blatantly false assertions.""

Republicans hold a 51-49 edge in the Senate going into the November elections.

Sasse has been one of the most frequent and vocal critics of Trump policies â€“ calling out the president for his handling of issues ranging from gun control to tariffs. While admitting that the president has been successful in some respects - including the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court â€“ Sasse added that ""itâ€™s pretty obviousâ€ that the presidentâ€™s administration is â€œa reality show soap opera.â€

""What you'd like is the president to not worry so much about the short-term of staffing, but the long-term of vision-casting for America,"" he said.



Sasse also made news last week when he lashed out at Trump for complaining that his own Justice Department's indictments against two Republican congressmen were endangering the GOP's midterm election prospects.

""The United States is not some banana republic with a two-tiered system of justice â€” one for the majority party and one for the minority party,"" Sasse said in a statement.

3FDWKV9VCOKUHBHUBQRKN680HU7UMR,"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, police superintendent tell neighborhoods to 'step up' after another bloody weekend","Chicago's top cop stood side-by-side with Mayor Rahm Emanuel to deliver a message to the residents of their city in the midst of another bloody weekend: ""Step up.""

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said no arrests have been made yet in the flurry of weekend shootings, which he said were not random, and were ""fueled by gang conflicts."" Instead, after 11 people were killed and 70 were shot in ongoing violence, Johnson said the onus was on the communities to take responsibility.

""As neighborhoods, we can do better,"" Johnson said at a news conference, adding he and Emanuel are always held accountable. But, Johnson said, there is a lack of accountability in the communities plagued by violence.

""I hear people holding us accountable all the time but I never hear people saying 'these individuals out here on the street need to stop pulling the trigger.' I never hear that,"" Johnson said. ""Itâ€™s the same individuals that continually commit those crimes. Where is the accountability for them?""

Johnson said the weekend's violence was focused in four of the city's 22 police districts, on Chicago's West and South Sides, in areas where street gangs are entrenched.

""The city isn't on fire, we just have to do what we have to do in those challenged areas to make it better,"" he said.

CHICAGOâ€™S GUN VIOLENCE IS INTOLERABLE -- TRUMP SHOULD PROVIDE HELP

Johnson, who became commissioner in 2016, said he made the commitment to make the department better, particularly repairing relationships with the black community. But, he said, police can't do it alone and officers need the community's help to solve continued violence.

""CPD is only as good as the faith the community has in it,"" he said. ""Every socitial ill simply can't be placed at the doorstep and expect police to fix that. It's not about what the police department can do, it's about what you should do.""

Emanuel, an ex-chief of staff to former president Barack Obama and a noted top critic of President Trump who has boasted the Windy City as a sanctuary city status and need for more gun restrictions to clamp down on crime, echoed Johnson's appeal to violence-plagued neighborhoods to step up.

""If you know who did this, be a neighbor, speak up,"" Emanuel said, adding that people living in these neighborhoods know who is committing the violence and need to take back their communities. The mayor added that people who live in neighborhoods where the shootings occurred have to be willing to name potential suspects.

""All of us know that this is not Chicago, what we saw,"" he told reporters. All of us who love the city and call it home have the responsibility to deal our neighborhoods.""

Police have said so far this year violent crime has declined overall in Chicago, with a 20 percent reduction of murders so far in 2018. Still, anti-violence protesters have blocked highways to voice their outrage.

Johnson said that the city's residents should be able to gather outside to enjoy block parties without having to worry about being gunned down.

""My relatives, people I grew up with in the city call me all the time,"" he said. ""What worries me is in certain areas of the city we begin to normalize these things.""

CHICAGO'S BLOODY WEEKEND SEES AT LEAST 40 PEOPLE SHOT, 4 OF THEM KILLED

The Windy City ended 2017 with fewer homicides, 650, than 2016, when there were 771. Although the drop was significant, it exceeded the combined number of killings in New York City and Los Angeles, which are the two U.S. cities bigger than Chicago.

The city's gun violence has drawn widespread attention, including from Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who blamed the problem on Chicago's longtime ""Democratic rule"" in a series of tweets on Sunday and Monday.

The former New York City mayor also tweeted his support for Chicago's former superintendent, Garry McCarthy, referring to him as ""Jerry"" and calling him a ""policing genius.""

""Chicago murders are direct result of one party Democratic rule for decades. Policing genius Jerry McCarthy can do for Chicago what I did for NYC. He was one of the architects of Compstat. Slashed homicides over 70%. Tens of thousands of lives saved,"" Giuliani tweeted.

CHICAGO PROTESTERS DEMANDING RAHM EMANUELâ€™S RESIGNATION MARCH TO WRIGLEY FIELD, CLOSING MAJOR ROADS

McCarthy announced this year he plans to run for mayor next February against Emanuel, who fired McCarthy in 2015 after the release of dashcam video showing a white police officer shoot a black teenager 16 times.

Misspelling Emanuel's last name, Giuliani tweeted: ""He can do a lot better than Mayor Emmanuel who is fiddling while Chicago burns.""

34D9ZRXCYSCD0XG1PI6FZEVC2GXSAP,Prosecutors: Russian woman was in contact with Kremlin intelligence,"July 18 (UPI) â€” Federal prosecutors said Wednesday Maria Butina, a U.S.-based Russian woman charged this week with conspiring to influence American politics, was recently in contact with a suspected Russian intelligence official.

In a 12-page court filing, prosecutors deemed her a serious flight risk and asked that she be detained ahead of trial.

Another filing said Butina, 29, has been in contact with agents of Russiaâ€™s FSB counterintelligence agency throughout her two-year stay in the United States.

The filings follow Butinaâ€™s arrest Sunday on charges she conspired to develop relationships in the United States and infiltrate organizations with influence on U.S. politics.

The FBI had previously determined that even though Butina had a personal relationship with someone in court papers called Person 1, she offered a different person â€œsex in exchange for a position with a special interest organization,â€ NPR reported.

Person 1 was identified as political fundraiser Paul Erickson. The special interest organization was not identified, but Butina sought the involvement of the National Rifle Association as a way to make contacts with U.S. political leaders, the NPR report said.

â€œThe defendant is considered to be on par with other covert Russian agents,â€ prosecutors said in a pretrial detention request.

31KSVEGZ35AY6VJRBY22RTN78XHRWB,Students Keep Aim True against Gun Violence,"The NRA has become a fanatical political lobby.

Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done, we call BS.

Founded in 1871 to advance marksmanship and firearms safety, the NRA kept to that mission for more than 100 years. But in 1977 hardliners took over the organization, and turned it into the nation's foremost gun lobby. Now, the NRA spends millions for politicians that block any and all gun control legislation. And in 2016, it spent $31 million on just one race -- to elect Donald Trump president. Meanwhile, on the income end, both gun manufacturers and individuals contributemillions to the NRA.

For the apparent purpose of keeping those individual contributions flowing, the NRA pumps out fearful -- and dangerous-sounding -- political propaganda. For example, earlier this year the home page of its website featured its CEO, Wayne LaPierre, decrying a ""terrifying"" ""socialist wave."" And a recent NRA ad darkly warns of ""They:""

They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that their President is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth. ...

However, some NRA members commented against the ad. Here is one of those comments, which raised an important point:

As a strong supporter of gun rights, I am flabbergasted and appalled by this ""ad."" How embarrassing for you to promote hate and fear, especially within the context of gun ownership (a place where hate and fear must be kept *most* in check).

Gun control laws work all around the world.

They say tougher guns laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS.

The United States' assault weapons ban of 1994 to 2004 showed a reduction in crime using the banned weapons. But, because the law had grandfathered-in millions of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, the overall reduction was negligible.

But Australia, which Gonzales mentioned in her speech, had a different story. Prompted by a massacre of 35 people by semi-automatic rifle in 1996, Australia banned those weapons later that same year. The country also bought back the banned weapons, and accepted other weapons voluntarily turned in, resulting in a 20% cut in the number of guns among the population. The law also brought stricter gun licensing and registration. And studies strongly point to the law helping to bring down gun death and injury. Incidence of gun homicide was down 43% (from .43 to .25 per 100,000), and of gun suicide down 58% (from 2.6 to 1.1 per 100,000). And gun massacre (of four or more people at once, excluding familicide) was down to zero (from 13 over 18 years to none over 22 years).

Furthermore, it just stands to reason that less guns makes for less gun death. And simple statistics bear that out. Both state-by-state within the USA, and country-by-country across the world, there is a strong correlation between guns per capita and gun deaths. The United States with about 88 guns per 100 people has 91 gun deaths per 100,000 people. The next-highest in guns per capita is Switzerland, with about 44 per 100 people, and about 37 gun deaths per 100,000. Near the low end is Japan, with about 1 gun per 100 people, and about one gun death per 100,000.

Gun accidents will happen.

They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS.

Accidents will happen. And when an accident involves a device designed for killing, the effect is likely to be more damaging. Many cases of that can be found in the #GunFail series of blog postings, which has tracked news reports of accidental shootings from 2013 to 2017. Of those thousands of incidents, here are some from a post on July 3, 2017:

We had a campus concealed carrier in Utah accidentally fire the weapon in his backpack in the middle of a Utah Valley University food court. ... ... ... [T]hat is the second time UVU has made the GunFAIL list, the first being in May 2015, when one police academy cadet accidentally shot another while taking his gun apart, forgetting there was a round in the chamber. Back in 2012, a student at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah, accidentally discharged his concealed weapon. And it was in Taylorsville, Utah, in September 2014 when a sixth grade teacher injured herself when she accidentally shot and shattered a toilet in the faculty bathroom with her (not very well) concealed handgun. So, you know, keep that all in mind as more states begin to permit campus carry and allow teachers to arm themselves in the classroom.

While there are cases where people successfully use a gun to protect themselves, there are many more cases of accidental shooting death or injury. The website, shootingtracker.com, which Gonzales mentioned in her speech, lists and classifies all reported shooting incidents. Between April 3rd and July 7th this year, there were 227 defensive usages that stopped a crime, but almost twice as many (448) accidental shootings, most (385) of which caused death or injury.

Assault rifles are too lethal for civilian use.

They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS.

Of course, guns are more deadly than knives, and, unlike the car, are designed to kill. Especially dangerous, among firearms available to persons in the USA, are assault rifles, which are designed for war. One such assault rifle, the AR-15, has been used several recent mass-shootings, including Parkland. The AR-15 fires a bullet at three times the velocity of a typical handgun. Heather Sher, a radiologist that worked on Parkland massacre victims, said:

The injury along the path of the bullet from an AR-15 is vastly different from a low-velocity handgun injury. ... The high-velocity bullet causes a swath of tissue damage that extends several inches from its path. It does not have to actually hit an artery to damage it and cause catastrophic bleeding. Exit wounds can be the size of an orange. ... One of my ER colleagues was waiting nervously for his own children outside the school. While the shooting was still in progress, the first responders were gathering up victims whenever they could and carrying them outside the building. Even as a physician trained in trauma situations, there was nothing he could do at the scene to help save the victims who had been shot with the AR-15. Most of them died on the spot; they had no fighting chance at life. As a doctor, I feel I have a duty to inform the public of what I have learned as I have observed these wounds and cared for these patients. Itâ€™s clear to me that AR-15 and other high-velocity weapons, especially when outfitted with a high-capacity magazine, have no place in a civilianâ€™s gun cabinet.

You have no constitutional right to an AR-15.

They say no laws could have prevented the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS.

We have seen that tougher gun laws work. But are they constitutional? In the 18th century, some of the states were worried that Congress, which had the power to arm the militia, might disarm it and leave state authorities defenseless against insurrection, slave revolt or Indian attack. So, James Madison quelled that worry with the Second Amendment:

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

For many years, the well regulated militia has been the National Guard. So, the Second Amendment, like the Third Amendment, had become a useless relic -- until 2008. That was when the Supreme Court, thew out long-established precedent, and created out of the Second Amendment a right to keep a registered and licensed loaded handgun at home, on the grounds of self-defense. To do that, Justice Antonin Scalia, the self-avowed constitutional literalist, discounted the plain purpose literally expressed in the first half of the Second Amendment. Then, overlooking the arguments at the time of the Bill of Rights being written, he reached back to a 17th century English law, to try to justify the new right that he created.

But even Scalia did not claim an unlimited right. His opinion said that ""dangerous and unusual weapons"" are not protected. Bans on concealed weapons, and bans on weapons in places like schools and other public buildings, by his opinion, are still constitutional. As we have seen, assault rifles like the AR-15 are unusually dangerous, so would not be protected by Scalia's new self-defense-by-gun constitutional right.

You have a constitutional right ""peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""

That us kids don't know what we're talking about, that we're too young to understand how the government works. We call BS.

On March 14, the one month mark from the Parkland massacre, one million students walked outof 3000 schools across the nation. The students commemorated the Parkland high school students that were killed with 17 minutes of silence -- one for each student killed. Later, on Saturday, March 24, millions again turned out for the ""March for Our Lives,"" in which students across the nation peaceably assembled to petition the Government for a redress of grievance. That grievance is the long lack of legal action to cut gun violence across the nation. The March for Our Lives movement lists the legal action it seeks:

Universal, comprehensive background checks

Bringing the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives) into the 21st century with a digitized, searchable database

Funds for the CDC (Center for Disease Control) to research the gun violence epidemic in America

High-capacity magazine ban

A ban on semi-automatic assault rifles

In addition to peaceable assembly, the students have pushed for registering and encouraging citizens to vote on this issue. So, these actions look to be the very height of democracy in action. And the students keep at it. They are now on a summer barnstorming tour of the country to speak for sensible gun control and to register young people to vote.

Moments later, Fred Guttenberg, father of slain Parkland student Jaime Guttenberg, confirmed his acceptance of Feinsteinâ€™s invitation to the hearing and dismissed accusations that his attempt to shake the nomineeâ€™s hand was a political stunt.

â€œTo be clear, I was invited by Senator Feinstein to attend today. Anyone who knows me knows I will talk to anyone,â€ he tweeted. â€œI initiated an effort to introduce myself to Kavanaugh. It was my decison and I own it. Anyone trying to come up with some politial master plan is simply wrong.â€

Guttenberg attempted to shake Kavanaughâ€™s hand after committee members took a recess around noon. Shortly after the incident, Guttenberg claimed in a tweet that Kavanaugh â€œturned his back to me and walked away,â€ suggesting he didnâ€™t shake his hand because the Judge â€œdid not want to deal with the reality of gun violence.â€

Just walked up to Judge Kavanaugh as morning session ended. Put out my hand to introduce myself as Jaime Guttenberg's dad. He pulled his hand back, turned his back to me and walked away.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who repeatedly called for the hearing to be adjourned over late-arriving documents, took to Twitter to criticize the Judgeâ€™s non-handshake. â€œIf Kavanaugh wonâ€™t even give him a handshake, how can we believe he would give gun violence victims a fair shake in court?â€ she wrote.

Twitch, the video service that was streaming the Madden 19 competition during Sunday's deadly shooting in Jacksonville, Florida, is reviewing security plans for its October TwitchCon event.

A gunman killed two players and injured 11 others Sunday before taking his own life, police say, at the video game competition event at the GLHF Game Bar along the St. Johns River entertainment complex in Jacksonville.

When the shooting happened, the video game competition was being streamed live on Twitch, the streaming service acquired four years ago by Amazon for $1 billion.

Twitch, which has more than 2 million broadcasters and millions more viewers, has its fourth annual TwitchCon scheduled for Oct. 26-28 in San Jose, California. The event, which sells ticket to the public, will feature esports competitions, cosplay contests and other events.

The broadcaster had already posted security procedures on the TwitchCon website including the notification that attendees would be scanned upon entry, all bags would be searched, and uniformed police and uniformed security guards would be in attendance.

But those procedures are being reviewed for potential tightening, Twitch said late Monday.

""Security at TwitchCon is our top priority and is something we take very seriously at all our events,"" the company said in a statement. ""We regularly review and iterate on our policies and approach in order to provide a safe and positive experience for staff, attendees, and exhibitors. In the wake of yesterdayâ€™s tragedy we will be re-reviewing our plans and updating them accordingly.""

Last year's three-day TwitchCon, held at the Long Beach Convention Center, attracted about 50,000 attendees, according to OC Weekly.

We are shocked and saddened by the tragedy that took place in Jacksonville today. Twitch and all its staff send our deepest sympathies to the victims, their loved ones, and everyone in our community who's grieving today. â€” Twitch (@Twitch) August 26, 2018

3PEG1BH7AF9KVO8LQNX933O8345KBV,The Strange Case of the NRA-Linked Russian Charged With Being a Kremlin Agent,"Mariia Butina, a self-described Russian gun rights activist with links to the National Rifle Association, has been arrested by the FBI on charges she was acting as a Russian agent in an orchestrated effort to infiltrate American political organizations, including the NRA.

The Justice Department said in court filings that the 29-year-old woman worked to establish ""back channel"" lines of communication with U.S. politicians to ""advance the agenda of the Russian Federation"" from as early as 2015 and continuing through at least February 2017.

Butina, who attended at least two Trump campaign events to ask the then-candidate Russia-related questions, worked at the direction of a high-level Kremlin official who was previously a member of the legislature of the Russian Federation and later became a top official at the Russian Central Bank, the documents said.

Butina, who resided in the United States on a student visa, set up a series of dinners in Washington and New York between Russian nationals and Americans with influence with the U.S. political system, according to the filings. ""She undertook her activities without officially disclosing the fact that she was acting as an agent of Russian government, as required by law,"" the Justice Department said.

The documents were made public Monday mere hours after President Donald Trump stood beside his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, after a joint summit in Helsinki. At the press conference afterward, Trump bashed the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian meddling and declined to criticize Putin for interfering in the election.

The charges also came after the Justice Department unveiled an indictment last week against 12 Russian military-intelligence officers for conspiring to hack the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton's campaign and state boards of election in 2016.

Taken together, the documentation shows a sweeping campaign at multiple levels of the Russian government to influence the outcome of the 2016 elections to the candidates whom they favored.

The documents against Butina, who also spells her first name Maria, were filed by the Justice Department, not the special counsel. The DOJ said she was arrested Saturday in Washington and made her initial appearance Monday before Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She was ordered held pending a hearing set for Wednesday.

According to the Justice Department's complaint, federal investigators seized Butina's electronic devices, including her laptop and iPhone, containing Twitter direct messages that showed coordination with an unnamed Russian official.

Robert Driscoll, a Washington lawyer representing Butina, told TIME in an email that his client was innocent and had been cooperating with ""various government agencies for months."" He added that Butina voluntarily appeared ""months ago"" before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and ""testified for 8 hours and produced thousands of documents."" She offered to do the same for the special counsel but Mueller's team declined, Driscoll said.

""There is simply no indication of Butina seeking to influence or undermine any specific policy or law in the United States - only to promote a better relationship between the two nations,"" he said, adding that over a dozen FBI agents executed a search warrant at her Washington apartment in April.

On her LinkedIn page, Butina says she studied at American University for a master's degree in International Service with ""a concentration in cyber policy."" (An American University spokeswoman confirmed she graduated in May.) Butina became well-known around Washington because of her odd self-promotion as a Russian gun rights activist. She stuck out -- not only because there is no substantive gun rights movement in Russia -- but also because of her outreach to Republicans. At the time around the 2016 election cycle, it marked a dramatic shift in Russia's attempts to influence U.S. domestic politics. During the Cold War, the Kremlin tried to forge links to the American left.

But, as TIME reported in March 2017, dinners organized by Butina were becoming a subject of interest. On such gathering, described as ""friendship &amp; dialogue dinners,"" by the Justice Department, on Feb. 1, 2017 a group that piled into Bistro Bis, a swanky French joint on Capitol Hill, a Washington institution that has hosted all sorts of political summits over the years. For four hours, current and former Russian officials dined with two Republican Congressmen, a conservative magazine publisher, a longtime GOP consultant and a close friend of top White House strategist Steve Bannon.

""We have so many people who are trying to destroy the relationship between Russia and the United States,"" Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California, who attended the dinner and has visited Russia at least a half-dozen times over the past five years, told TIME soon afterward. ""I'm trying my best to expand the amount of personal contacts we have with people who are engaged in government in Russia.""

One of the officials who attended the dinner: a deputy central banker and former Russian senator named Alexander Torshin, who appears to be the unnamed Russian official in the court documents. He has been part of a years-long campaign to build connections between Russia's leaders and American conservatives. The crusade, which predates the rise of Trump, has achieved significant success, sparking new alliances with leading U.S. evangelicals, lawmakers and powerful interest groups like the NRA.

In 2015, a collection of NRA officials flew over to Russia to attend Butina's annual gun conference, the Right to Bear Arms, details of which were included in a report from Democrats on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence made public on March 26.

Among them was Paul Erickson, a veteran Republican activist and longtime NRA member who attended the Feb. 1 dinner; former NRA and ACU chief David Keene; gun manufacturer and NRA first vice president Pete Brownell; and then-Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke, a Trump supporter now at America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC. One of their hosts was Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who was sanctioned by the White House in 2014 in connection with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. According to a disclosure filed by Clarke, Butina's group shelled out $6,000 for the sheriff's meals, lodging, transportation and other excursions on the trip. The NRA did not respond to a request for comment.

In April 2015, Butina and Torshin traveled to Tennessee to attend a fundraiser for a political group backing the presidential campaign of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, then viewed as a leading contender for the GOP nomination. In July, she attended Walker's campaign kickoff in Wisconsin. The same week, Butina flew to Las Vegas for one of Trump's first campaign events. She stood up and asked Trump whether he would end the ""damaging"" U.S. government sanctions on Russia. ""I know Putin, and I'll tell you what, we'll get along with Putin,"" he responded. ""I don't think you'd need the sanctions.""

She asked him a similar question about U.S.-Russia relations during an event in North Dakota: ""I don't think you'd need the sanctions,"" he said. ""I think we would get along very, very well."" In February 2017, Butina helped assemble the delegation of Russians who attended the National Prayer Breakfast. The group of 16 included Kremlin advisers, university presidents and the mayor of an eastern Russia city.

In the summer of 2015, Butina wrote an article in the National Interest, a magazine published by the Center for the National Interest, about her hopes for a thaw in the two nations' relationship, proclaiming: ""It may take the election of a Republican to the White House in 2016 to improve relations between the Russian Federation and the United States.""",https://www.yahoo.com/news/strange-case-nra-linked-russian-220811680.html,"['Republican', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic']","['1', '5', '1', '5', '4']"
3QX22DUVOPZUUQ6UGG1PJSAJVE8MVQ,Dad Of Brother And Sister Parkland Survivors Fatally Shot In Robbery,"A Florida family has been devastated again by gun violence. The father of two sibling survivors of the Parkland school attack was fatally shot during a robbery at his Fort Lauderdale convenience store.

On surveillance footage, a gunman is seen taking money from the cash register on Tuesday at Aunt Mollieâ€™s Food Store, owned by Ayub Ali, 61. Ali can be seen holding his hands in the air. The thief walked out, then returned to the store and shot Ali, Broward County sheriffâ€™s officials said in a statement.

It wasnâ€™t clear why the gunman returned. Ali was declared dead a short time later at a nearby hospital.

The sheriffâ€™s office released the surveillance video on Thursday as it sought help in identifying and locating the shooter. A friend eventually persuaded suspect Tyrone Fields Jr., 19, to turn himself in on Friday, officials said.

Ali was buried the same day. Fields is being held without bail.

Aliâ€™s son and daughter, Rahat, 15 and Elama, 17, survived the February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland that left 17 dead. Ali was the father of four children; the youngest is just 22 months old.

Ali moved to Florida from Bangladesh in the 1990s. He encouraged his daughter to travel to Washington for the â€œMarch for Our Livesâ€ rally organized by young people in the wake of the Parkland attack to advocate for stricter gun control laws, Elama Ali told CNN.

3IZPORCT1GRG95O2GZG2QQDKT94HR1,Trump factor looms large as Florida gubernatorial primary comes to close,"Rep. Ron DeSantis is hoping to ride the wave of President Trumpâ€™s endorsement to victory in Floridaâ€™s GOP gubernatorial primary on Tuesday, as he battles state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam in the costly and closely-watched contest.

The polls close in Florida -- where voters are choosing nominees for governor, senator and a slew of other offices -- at 7 p.m.

On Monday, Trump tried to help DeSantis over the finish line with a tweet of support. The current governor, Republican Rick Scott, is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for the Senate.

â€œCongressman Ron DeSantis is a special person who has done an incredible job,â€ the president tweeted. â€œHe is running in Tuesdays Primary for Governor of Floridaâ€¦.Strong on Crime, Borders and wants Low Taxes. He will be a great Governor and has my full and total Endorsement!â€

Trumpâ€™s support has played a starring role in the race, with DeSantis securing the lead in polls after winning Trump's endorsement.

During a Fox News-sponsored debate in June, DeSantis played up Trumpâ€™s backing of his campaign, expressing doubt that Putnam adequately supports Trump. â€œI am proud to have the endorsement of President Trump in this race,â€ DeSantis said.

DeSantis, 39, is an Iraq War veteran and decorated military lawyer who has served in the U.S. House since 2013. He is a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School.

Putnam, 44, has also played up his support for Trump, but has emphasized, â€œI am focused on Florida.â€

Putnam was elected as the stateâ€™s agriculture commissioner in 2010. He grew up on a cattle ranch and citrus grove, according to his campaign website, and has gotten the support of many Florida sheriffs.

Meanwhile, thereâ€™s a crowded Democratic primary for governor, including Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, Palm Beach billionaire Jeff Greene, former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, Orlando businessman Chris King and former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine.

Graham, a former congresswoman, has been consistently polling ahead seven points or more over her opponents.

Levine has spent millions of his own money and showed up Monday at the scene of the Jacksonville mass shooting to tout gun control.

Gillum, Tallahasseeâ€™s progressive mayor, hopes to be the first black governor of Florida and has the endorsement of the liberal Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

As for the Senate race, Scott -- who was urged to run for the seat by Trump -- is expected to win the GOP primary. He would then face Nelson, considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents running for re-election to the Senate.

Republicans, trying to hold onto control of the Senate, are hoping Scott could flip the seat.

Trump narrowly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in Florida in the 2016 presidential race by less than 2 percentage points.



Trump, again, emphasized his support for Scott ahead of the election.

â€œRick Scott of Florida is doing a fantastic job as Governor,â€ Trump tweeted. â€œJobs are pouring into the State and its economic health is better than ever before. He is strong on Crime, Borders, and loves our Military and Vets. Vote for Rick on Tuesday!â€

Elections are also taking place in Arizona, where three Republicans are facing off to replace outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake.

Officials in Arizona said Tuesday that problems with voting machines in several polling places temporarily prevented people from being able to cast ballots in the state's primary elections.

But a spokesman for Maricopa County, where the voting problems were reported, told Fox News on Tuesday afternoon that ""all polling locations dealing with technical issues this morning have been fixed.""

In the Senate race, two-term Rep. Martha McSally has emerged as the frontrunner in the GOP primary against former state Sen. Kelli Ward and Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The winner of this contest will likely face Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in November.

In the stateâ€™s governorâ€™s race, President Trump has endorsed the re-election effort of Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, who is facing a challenge Tuesday from former Secretary of State Ken Bennett.

Oklahoma on Tuesday is also holding primary runoff elections, with focus on the Republican race between former Oklahoma City mayor Mick Cornett and Tulsa businessman Kevin Stitt.

3BFF0DJK8YUIFTFAVIXWUJL4QRITSJ,Chance The Rapper Demands Rahm Emanuel's Resignation over Police Shootings,"Chance The Rapper demanded Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuelâ€™s resignation over the shooting of citizens by police as part of an announcement of his purchase of a Chicago news website.

The rap artist, whose real name is Chancelor Jonathan Bennett, purchased the Chicago-centric news website Chicagoist.com, a site that had recently been shuttered after its owners deemed it unprofitable, Fox News reported.

Being a rapper, the artist announced his acquisition of the site in a rap song, but his elation over the new project was leavened by spite against the Windy Cityâ€™s mayor and former Barack Obama chief of staff.

In the song, the rapper insisted that he would â€œrun you racist bitches out of businessâ€ and would force Emanuel to resign as mayor.

â€œAnd Rahm, you done, Iâ€™m expectinâ€™ resignation â€¦ an open investigation on all of these paid vacations for murderers,â€ he said in the tune seeming to refer to the recent spate of police-involved shootings.

â€œIâ€™m extremely excited to be continuing the work of the Chicagoist, an integral local platform for Chicago news, events, and entertainmentâ€¦ I look forward to re-launching it and bringing the people of Chicago an independent media outlet focused on amplifying diverse voices and content,â€ Chance said later in a statement.

Chance The rapper has dabbled in Chicago politics for the last few years making news by donating large sums of money to the failing Chicago school system.

Chance The Rapper has also indulged a series of other political comments. In March he tweeted out another accusation against police demanding to know if â€œgun control include the police.â€ Also, Chance has been a big detractor of Illinoisâ€™ Republican governor Bruce Rauner and he was also a big supporter of Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Despite that, he raised eyebrows in April by tweeting that black people â€œdonâ€™t have to be Democrats,â€ and later insisted that Democrats have done nothing to help black neighborhoods and schools in Chicago.

The organizers of Moroccoâ€™s bid for the 2026 World Cup were anything but subtle.

â€œMorocco is one of the worldâ€™s safest countries, with low rates of day-to-day crimes,â€ organizers stated in the executive summary of their bid, specifically touting the countryâ€™s â€œexceptionally low murder rates, benefiting from very low gun circulation.""

Safety wasn't a deciding factor when FIFA awarded the 2026 World Cup to North America, a bid led by the United States. Money and infrastructure were. But after yet another mass shooting, this time at a gaming tournament in Jacksonville, we cannot assume that will always be the case.

It seems crass to even think about the ramifications for global sporting events in the U.S. after Sunday's shooting at the Madden NFL 19 Classic qualifier. Two people trying to turn their love for a video game into some extra cash, maybe a little celebrity, are dead, and dozens more will be permanently scarred physically and emotionally.

But the gun violence that plagues America horrifies the rest of the world, as does our refusal to do anything about it. How much longer can we ask international sporting organizations, athletes and spectators to come to the U.S., promising they will be safe, when we canâ€™t even assure our own citizens of that?

Scared of going to USA, even though it used to be a place I always wanted to visit,â€ Cani, who is from Germany and a member of Electronic Sports' Game Changers community, said on Twitter after Sundayâ€™s shooting. â€œPeople are getting shot in movie theaters, schools, gaming tournaments, concerts and many more places over and over again. So sadâ€

Each year, the U.S. hosts dozens of professional and global sporting events without any security issues. We take our security measures seriously, with metal detectors at the entrance of venues, armed law-enforcement officials around the perimeter and no-fly zones.

But these events donâ€™t occur in a security bubble. Athletes and, even more so, spectators, will spend most of their time in unsecured areas. Hotels, restaurants, trains, taxis. They will, organizers and civic leaders hope, venture out to see the local sights and tourist attractions.

In most cases, nothing will happen.

But when 58 people are killed and 851 are injured at a concert, as they were last fall in Las Vegas, we cannot promise our guests they will be safe. When 49 people are murdered at a night club, as they were two years ago in Orlando, we cannot assure our visitors that no harm will come to them. When 26 people are gunned down in a church, as they were last year in Texas, we cannot guarantee the security of those who comes here.

And when children are massacred at school, which happens with such frequency throughout the country that weâ€™ve become almost numb to it, we cannot protect anyone.

â€œAgain and as usual its in the USA, here in Europe u wonâ€™t see such a sick thing,â€ a gamer whose Twitter handle is Holy123spirit posted Sunday afternoon. â€œI wonder what the USA can do about it.â€

Polls have repeatedly shown that the majority of Americans, gun owners included, favor sensible gun control. Things like mandatory waiting periods, universal background checks, bans on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines.

None of these would gut or even threaten the Second Amendment. Yet politicians continue to bow to the will of the NRA rather than that of their constituents. And theyâ€™ll do so until thereâ€™s a penalty on election day.

â€œAnother day. Another mass shooting in America,â€ Filipe Orlando, a gamer from Britain, said on Twitter. â€œWhen will the USA change their gun laws.â€

If basic decency doesn't compel an answer to that question, maybe economics will.

In addition to the 2026 World Cup, the U.S. will host the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028. U.S. companies and wealthy Americans also are investing heavily in esports, which are wildly popular among young people across the globe.

They're also still in their infancy, meaning they have the potential to reshape the global sporting market over the next decade or two. If you're not convinced, check out what a 12-year-old is watching on YouTube these days.

If any of these groups decide the U.S. is too dangerous and takes their games elsewhere, it won't simply be an embarrassment. There will be financial repercussions.

Thoughts and prayers won't be enough then, either.

In this photo taken on Sunday, April 21, 2013, Maria Butina, leader of a pro-gun organization in Russia, speaks to a crowd during a rally in support of legalizing the possession of handguns in Moscow, Russia. Butina, a 29-year-old gun-rights activist, served as a covert Russian agent while living in Washington, gathering intelligence on American officials and political organizations and working to establish back-channel lines of communications for the Kremlin, federal prosecutors charged Monday, July 16, 2018. (AP Photo) ORG XMIT: XAZ125 (Photo: AP)

WASHINGTON â€“ Maria Butina, the Russian citizen accused of attempting to infiltrate U.S. political organizations, received financial support from a Russian billionaire with ties to U.S. energy and technology firms, according to a report Sunday.

Butina, 29, was arrested last weekend and charged with trying to influence groups like the National Rifle Association. Butina was deemed an ""extreme flight risk"" and is being held without bail while she awaits trial.

In April, Butina told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Konstantin Nikolaev, a Russian billionaire, provided funding for a guns right group she represented, according to The Washington Post.

A spokesman for Nikolaev told the Post that the businessman was in contact with Butina but declined to confirm whether he offered money.

Investigators say Butina worked for years as a covert Russian agent attempting to ""advance the interests of her home country."" Prosecutors said this past week that Butina began a romantic relationship with a U.S. person who she used to access ""an extensive network"" of other influential Americans.

Prosecutors have said Butina, a graduate student, was working in the United States at the direction of an unnamed Russian government official, seeking to establish ""back channel"" lines of communications. Prosecutors have said she was in contact with Russian operatives during her time in the U.S.

Nikolaevâ€™s wealth was built mostly through port and railroad businesses in Russia, The Post reported. Nikolaev also sits on the board of a Houston-based ethane company called American Ethane. That company was applauded by President Donald Trump at an event in China last year for striking a trade deal to supply liquid ethane to Beijing.

Maria Butina and Paul Erickson have encountered several challenges that have surely put their relationship to the test.

Long distances. Money problems. Meeting the prospective in-laws. And now a federal investigation. A sudden arrest. And detention while Butina awaits a trial on charges of acting as a foreign agent that threatens to thrust their private lives into public view.

Federal prosecutors say Butina, a 29-year-old Russian gun-rights activist, ensnared Erickson, a 56-year-old conservative political operative,Â&nbsp;in a â€œduplicitous relationship,â€Â&nbsp;using him for cover and connections as she developed an influence operation designed to â€œadvance the agenda of the Russian Federation.â€

But Butinaâ€™s attorney, Robert Driscoll, says that even in the face of those allegations, the couple, as far as he can tell, remains â€œstrong.â€ In fact, Driscoll says, Butina told him Erickson even visited her in jail on Saturday.

In an interview with ABC News last week, which aired Tuesday on Good Morning America, Driscoll offered an array of fresh details about the five-year relationship at the crux of the governmentâ€™s case against Butina and pushed back against the notion that his client was looking for something other than love and affection from Erickson.

â€œI think in some ways itâ€™s a classic love story,â€ Driscoll said. â€œI think [reporters] are filling in a lot of the gaps with a lot of spy novels.â€

Erickson did not respond to repeated messages seeking comment. Erickson has not been accused of any wrongdoing and it remains unclear if he could face any charges in connection to Butinaâ€™s alleged conspiracy. Several messages left at the office of the attorney said to be representing Erickson were not returned. A spokesperson for the National Rifle Association, where Erickson had deep ties to high-ranking officials, did not respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office declined to comment, though on Thursday prosecutors filed a letter to the court accusing Driscoll of violating local rules by continuing to discuss the case with the media despite a previous warning from the judge.

Butina met Erickson in Moscow in 2013, Driscoll told ABC News. Erickson had traveled there with then-NRA President David Keene to meet with Butina, the young leader of a nascent Russian gun-rights group called â€œThe Right to Bear Arms.â€

Their romantic relationship began shortly thereafter on New Yearâ€™s Eve in Tel Aviv. Where the government sees a â€œcovert Russian agentâ€ with ties to the Russian intelligence services seizing an opportunity to infiltrate a powerful American political organization, Driscoll sees only a pair of â€œambitiousâ€ people who â€œhit it offâ€ over their â€œsimilar interests.â€

Butina made frequent trips to the United States in the ensuing years, becoming a fixture at various conservative conferences and conventions where Erickson allegedly helped her make inroads with Americaâ€™s political elite. In August 2016, she moved to Washington, D.C. on a student visa to study international relations at American University.

And they often traveled together, not only to centers of power like Washington, D.C. and Moscow, but also to their respective hometowns in South Dakota and Siberia to meet each otherâ€™s families. When Ericksonâ€™s mother died last year, Driscoll said, Butina attended the funeral.

They even booked a Disney Cruise in 2014 and took a jaunt to Disney World in 2016. Butinaâ€™s fascination with Disney ran so deep, Driscoll said, that the couple once recorded a duet and accompanying music video in a Moscow music studio as a birthday present for Erickson that showed the couple gazing adoringly into each otherâ€™s eyes as they sang the title track from â€œBeauty and the Beast.â€

â€œI think you also look at this and say, â€˜This looks pretty legitimate,â€™â€ Driscoll said of the video, which was obtained exclusively by ABC News. â€œAt least I do. Maybe Iâ€™m a sucker for romance.â€

For Driscoll, this is all evidence that Butina and Erickson, despite the governmentâ€™s claims to the contrary, are engaged in a mutual and genuine cross-cultural romance.

â€œTheyâ€™ve done all the things you would expect in kind of a significant long-term relationship,â€ Driscoll said.

The problem is that, according to the government, theyâ€™ve done much more than that.

The government has alleged that an unnamed â€œU.S. Person 1,â€ which sources have identified as Erickson, â€œworked with Butina to arrange introductions to U.S. persons having influence in American politics,â€ including high-ranking members of the NRA and organizers of the National Prayer Breakfast, that would ultimately give her a surprising level of access to conservative politicians, including â€” in one memorable interaction captured on video â€” to a future president.

It would appear that, even as Erickson was helping Butina forge those connections, he may have been aware of the political implications.

â€œUnrelated to specific presidential campaigns,â€ Erickson wrote in an October 2016 email to an acquaintance that was later obtained by the FBI, â€œIâ€™ve been involved in securing a VERY private line of communication between the Kremlin and key [unnamed political party] leaders through, of all conduits, the [unnamed gun-rights organization].â€

And during an FBI raid of Ericksonâ€™s South Dakota home, investigators discovered a handwritten note suggesting Erickson may have been aware of a possible job offer from Russian intelligence services: â€œHow to respond to FSB offer of employment?â€ Erickson scratched, an apparent reference to the Russian equivalent of the CIA.

Even Driscoll didnâ€™t have an explanation for the note.

â€œWhatever Paul wrote,â€ Driscoll said, â€œPaulâ€™s the one whoâ€™s gonna have to explain.â€

Driscoll described Butina as a promising graduate student whose career has been derailed by this case, but prosecutors claim that was just a â€œcover while she continued to work on behalf the Russian Official,â€ which based on the description appears to be Alexander Torshin, deputy governor of the Russian Central Bank and a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

(MORE: Former Trump campaign aide was in alleged Russian agent's social network)



Indeed, it was her longtime mentor and alleged handler Torshin, ABC News has learned, who wrote some of her recommendations for graduate school.

â€œShe meets and charms world leaders effortlessly and shall greet her fellow students with equal ease,â€ Torshin wrote of Butina in a letter of recommendation, a copy of which can be read below, to Columbia Universityâ€™s Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences, one of the seven graduate schools to which she applied. â€œThank you for considering her â€” please teach her and return her home ready for the next chapter in Russian / U.S. relations.â€

Erickson allegedly helped her maintain that cover. He supported her financially, telling McClatchy DC he established a South Dakota-based company Bridges LLC with Butina in order to help defray her educational expenses, and according to court filings, assisted with her coursework â€œby editing papers and answering exam questions.â€

Meanwhile, prosecutors claim, Butina â€œappear[ed] to treat [her relationship with Erickson] as simply a necessary aspect of her activities.â€ She privately expressed â€œdisdainâ€ for continuing to live with him, prosecutors claim, and even â€œoffered another individual â€¦ sex in exchange for a position within a special interest organization.â€

Of all the governmentâ€™s accusations, Driscoll says that claim angered and upset Butina the most.

â€œThatâ€™s just simply not true,â€ he said, calling the widespread portrayal of her as a kind of â€œRed Sparrowâ€ both â€œunfortunateâ€ and â€œsexist.â€

â€œI think anyone would be upset,â€ Driscoll added. â€œThe government, for lack of a better term, called her a whore. Itâ€™s not very nice to have happen to you in open court.â€

(MORE: Maria Butina, Russian gun rights activist linked to NRA, charged as Kremlin agent)



On Friday, Driscoll slammed the governmentâ€™s case against Butina in a motion filed to the court, calling it â€œa war drum based on pure fictionâ€ and accusing prosecutors of taking what was â€œclearly a jokeâ€ out of context in order to smear his client as a â€œKremlin-trained seductress.â€

â€œThe only evidence the government relied on for its explosive [sex-for-access] claim was an excerpt from an innocuous three-year-old text exchange sent in Russia between Ms. Butina and DK, her longtime friend, assistant, and public relations man for The Right to Bear Arms gun rights group that she founded,"" the filing reads. ""DK"" is not identified.

As she awaits trial, Butina remains in jail in Alexandria, Virginia. She is due back in court on Sept. 10. Butinaâ€™s future â€“ and the future of her relationship with Erickson â€“ are, to say the least, uncertain.

Even if Butina prevails, Driscoll said, her visa could be revoked, putting yet another obstacle between her and Erickson.

â€œIf she gets out, theyâ€™ll cross that bridge when they get to it,â€ Driscoll said. â€œAnd thatâ€™s a problem I would love for her to have.â€

(Noah Seelam/AFP)

Ikea has long been known as a massive one-stop warehouse for everything from assemble-it-yourself bunk beds to artificial potted plants to Swedish meatballs.

On Monday, one child found something a little different at an Ikea store in Fishers, Ind., a suburb of Indianapolis: a handgun inside a sofa.

The firearm had apparently fallen into the cushions after its owner sat down on the couch, Sgt. Tom Weger of the Fishers Police Department told The Washington Post.

â€œHe sat down and somehow or another it became dislodged from this body and when he got up he didnâ€™t realize that he was without it,â€ Weger said.

After â€œjust a few minutes,â€ a 6-year-old child found the gun and fired it at least once into the couch cushions, Weger said. It was then the gun owner noticed his gun was missing.

â€œAs soon as he realized that there was a commotion in the store, the gun owner quickly identified himself . . . and fully cooperated with the investigation,â€ Weger said.

[Ikea has changed the way we think about furniture]

In a statement, Ikea said it had apologized to the family of the child and was taking the incident seriously.

â€œWe have processes in place to ensure that the store is safe for customers and co-workers. For example, our store team has regular safety walks and audits which happen before, during and after opening hours,â€ the company stated. â€œAs soon as we were made aware of the situation, our co-workers took the action they were trained to do to ensure the safety of customers. We are cooperating with police as they investigate this incident.â€

No arrests were made Monday, but the Hamilton County prosecutorâ€™s office will decide if criminal charges are warranted, Weger said.

â€œWeâ€™re just very fortunate that no one was injured and we want to press the importance of responsible gun ownership and making certain that, if you are going to carry a weapon, that itâ€™s under control at all times,â€ Weger said.

Although Ikea says it has a no-weapons policy â€œto prevent exactly these types of situations,â€ Indiana has some of the most pro-gun laws in the United States.

â€œIndiana has a strong [concealed-carry] law with low fees, no training requirement and full recognition of out-of-state permits,â€ according to a ranking in Guns &amp; Ammo magazine. â€œOpen carry is also legal in the Hoosier State.â€

[A 9-year-old wanted a video game controller from his sister â€” so he shot her, police say]

Evaluating those same gun laws, the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence has given Indiana a â€œD-â€ grade, pointing out that in 2016, the state had the 18th highest rate of gun deaths per capita in the nation.

Attorney Guy Relford told WTTV News that violating Ikeaâ€™s no-weapons policy in Indiana would not be considered illegal and that it would be difficult to prove criminal recklessness in this case.

â€œBeing a knucklehead is not a crime in Indiana, or in most places,â€ Relford told the news station. â€œI actually doubt there will be criminal charges filed.â€

The incident occurred just three days after the Fishers Police Department promoted responsible gun ownership on its social media accounts.

â€œModel responsible behavior around guns,â€ read a flier the police department tweeted Friday. â€œTell your peers to be SMART.â€

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan on Thursday told a group of students from Great Mills High School, where a 16-year- old girl was killed earlier this year, that he would support toughening a law that holds parents responsible when their children gain access to their guns.

The Republican governor, who is seeking a second term and faces a challenge from Democrat Ben Jealous, also told the teenagers that he would reject an election endorsement from the National Rifle Association if the organization offered one.

â€œHe told them he wasnâ€™t expecting it and didnâ€™t want it,â€ Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse said of an NRA endorsement. â€œHe doesnâ€™t think the NRA are big fans of his at the moment.â€

Hogan signed numerous gun control measures after the March school shooting, including a â€œred flagâ€ bill designed to keep guns out of the hands of people who are deemed a danger to themselves and others, and legislation that bans bump stocks and other rapid-trigger devices.

He was endorsed by the NRA when he ran for governor in 2014.

The 40-minute meeting with the students, who are planning a gun-violence awareness rally in Annapolis this weekend, was four months in the making, senior Jaxon Oâ€™Mara said.

â€œIt really went well,â€ she said. â€œI was surprised at how receptive he was.â€

Oâ€™Mara was not at school the day 17-year-old Austin Rollins entered the school with a semiautomatic handgun owned by his father and fired at Jaelynn Rose Willey in the school hallway.

But she does remember the tweets from her friends at school. She also remembered seeing a plea from Jaelynnâ€™s mother, Melissa Willey, on social media moments after the shooting, asking students to tell her daughter to contact her.

And she remembers â€œbawlingâ€ when she learned that Jaelynn, who was a family friend, was taken off life support.

â€œBefore the shooting, my biggest worry was prom,â€ Oâ€™Mara said.

Now she has joined a group of young activists organizing protests, pushing for meetings with elected officials and calling for changes to state and federal gun laws.

Among their objectives, they want the Maryland legislature to toughen a state law that says a person may not store or leave a loaded firearm in a location where the person knows or should know that an unsupervised child younger than 16 can gain access to it.

The students want the law to cover those younger than 18.

â€œItâ€™s very frustrating, because a lot of people in our community feel no one is being held responsible,â€ Oâ€™Mara said. â€œWeâ€™re not on a witch hunt on the family of the shooter. We just want to make sure this doesnâ€™t happen again.â€

Denzel Washington's ""The Equalizer 2"" is in theaters July 20. The actor says this is his first sequel because, â€œI havenâ€™t needed one up to now."" (Photo: RICHARD SHOTWELL/INVISION/AP)

LOS ANGELES â€“ Denzel Washington is not above a green juice.

On a hot summer afternoon, Washington, rather jolly today and clad casually in all black, is puzzling over the customizable cold-press menu at the Four Seasons Hotel. His day will end with the premiere for his first-ever sequel, ""The Equalizer 2"" (in theaters Friday), but right now the two-time Oscar winner is debating what to blend with ginger and pineapple.

â€œIt wasnâ€™t like, 'Oh, I need a franchise,' â€ says Washington, 63, explaining why he chose to resume the role of ex-CIA operative-turned-vigilante Robert McCall in the follow-up to 2014's ""The Equalizer."" â€œI havenâ€™t needed one up to now. What do I need one for? And Iâ€™ve been asked. Like, they wanted to do a prequel to 'Safe House.' And they wanted to do an 'Inside Man 2.' But it didnâ€™t make sense to me.â€

But the bombastic, R-rated ""Equalizer 2"" did, which finds his quiet, violence-prone hero attempting to stay under the radar as a Lyft driver â€“ until his beloved friend is murdered.

Not that Washington was overly familiar with the ride-sharing enterprise.

â€œIâ€™ve never taken a Lyft in my life!â€ says the actor, who took an educational ride before cameras rolled. â€œI have my own car, why would I need a Lyft?"" He shrugs, noting that he doesn't drink. ""That's a generational thing.â€

He sees skepticism. â€œItâ€™s not?â€ Washington laughs. â€œYou see some 60-year-old guys stumbling into their Lyft car?â€

The first ""Equalizer"" grossed $101 million on a budget half that size, with audiences cheering on Washington's Everyman, who brings bloody justice upon those assailing the weak.

Washington likens the character's popularity to â€œgood therapy, from what Iâ€™m hearing. You need somebody to go kick everybodyâ€™s butt. Donâ€™t you go to the movies to forget sometimes and have a good time?â€

""Equalizer 2"" provides a fantastical (and air-conditioned) reprieve from an unyielding news cycle of political turmoil.

Washington's tonic for the headlines? â€œNovember,â€ he says, with a deep laugh and a clap. â€œIâ€™m not telling people how to vote, but Novemberâ€™s coming.â€

Today, the actor is well-aware that the weapons-laden ""Equalizer 2"" is hitting theaters in the midst of a heated debate about gun control. He calls the recent news of fatal shootings, including those in Texas, Florida, Maryland and Las Vegas, ""frightening.""

But Washington deems the effect of entertainment on its audience â€œa complicated subject. Whatâ€™s more violent than the news?"" he asks. ""Itâ€™s not simple, (as) if we just stop (making violent movies), everything will be fine. Come on, now. Thatâ€™s just not the case.â€

In ""Equalizer 2,"" Washington silences adversaries with his fists. In his own life, Washington insists he doesnâ€™t experience conflict (""Define conflict,"" he counters) â€“ even while making movies in Hollywood. â€œI grew up on the streets of New York, I can smell nonsense,â€ he says.

The revered actor's circle remains tight: He employs an agent, a lawyer, a publicist. â€œI tell young people, even actors coming up, you always have the option to say no,"" he says. ""If you donâ€™t feel comfortable, you can get up and leave. You donâ€™t have to do anything to get a job and you shouldnâ€™t be made to feel that (way).""

An ill-fated kale/lemon/pineapple/ginger juice arrives. â€œSalud!â€ says Washington, taking a slug of the bitter green mixture. ""Woo!"" he shudders.

Summer is ending on a sweeter note: Washington's son, former St. Louis Rams player-turned-actor John David Washington, is earning praise for his star turn in Spike Leeâ€™s ""BlacKkKlansman"" (out Aug. 10).

â€œHeâ€™s a good kid, too,"" says Washington, adding that he and his wife of 35 years, Pauletta, are proud of all four children. ""They're all doing well,"" he says. ""But itâ€™s weird, as a father, itâ€™s like, man, heâ€™s taken (off) â€¦ heâ€™s his own man.""

He chuckles. ""I hope he gets rich and famous so he can take care of his old man.""

WASHINGTON â€“ Every time Daveed Diggs is driving and a police car pulls up behind him, he has an uneasy feeling, like that vehicle is a shark in the water.

The star of ""Blindspotting"" (in theaters Friday in select cites, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, California, Chicago and Washington, expands nationwide July 27) is fascinated to see the same fear in the audience, regardless of race, when Diggsâ€™ character is walking home late at night and a cop pulls up like a horror-movie monster, shining a spotlight in his direction.

â€œI donâ€™t know a black person who has not felt that when a police car has driven by,â€ Diggs says. And when audiences witness that scene, ""I think a lot of people (who aren't black) are also feeling it for the first time in a very palpable way. You get the sense that people have never been in these shoes before enough to really know what that feels like.â€

With equal doses of comedy and drama â€“ and an undeniably lyrical quality, with raps and spoken-word performances â€“ ""Blindspotting"" tackles issues of race, class, gun violence, police brutality and gentrification with two Oakland best friends. Not coincidentally, the film stars and is written by two Oakland best friends: Diggs and Rafael Casal met at Berkeley High School and later became collaborators.

Collin (Daveed Diggs, left) and Miles (Rafael Casal) are co-workers and loyal buddies since childhood in ""Blindspotting."" (Photo: LIONSGATE)

In the movie, Collin (Diggs) has three days left of his probation and heâ€™s just trying to stay on the straight and narrow, though his mischievous co-worker Miles (Casal) presents an obstacle to that: He immerses himself in African-American culture while also enjoying white privilege, which exacerbates his wild streak.

Collin witnesses a cop (Ethan Embry) gun down an unarmed black man in the back, and as the days unfold, a wedge is pushed between these two loyal friends and they start to see each otherâ€™s lives in very real ways.

â€œWhat we hope to do is hold up a mirror to the social climate in which we exist and just ask what you see, and what you are OK with and not OK with, and is this the world youâ€™re happy with?â€ says Casal, 32.

""We always say that we wish this felt like a period piece,"" says Diggs, 36, who started writing ""Blindspotting"" with Casal 10 years ago. ""We wish we could look at it and be like, 'Oh, man, remember 2009 when unarmed black men were just getting gunned down by police? What a crazy thing that happened often back then.â€™ But itâ€™s the same.""

Daveed Diggs (left) and Rafael Casal are, like their ""Blindspotting"" characters, friends from Oakland who met in high school. (Photo: JACK GRUBER/USA TODAY)

In the film, one character defines â€œblindspottingâ€ as â€œhow you can look at something and there could be another thing there you arenâ€™t seeing,â€ and Diggs and Casal presented the idea so audiences can examine â€“ and fix â€“ their own blind spots. â€œWe all have them. We all have to just dedicate ourselves to doing the work, and thatâ€™s a hard thing,â€ says Diggs, holding court with Casal at Busboys and Poets.

The name of the D.C. eatery/bookstore is inspired by Langston Hughes, so itâ€™s a fitting place to interview two wordsmiths who give the narrative a musical quality. In the filmâ€™s most powerful scene, Collin brandishes a gun, though itâ€™s what he says thatâ€™s just as dangerous when confronting a â€œphysical manifestation of demons that have been haunting him,â€ says Diggs, a Tony and Grammy winner for his dual roles of Thomas Jefferson and Marquis de Lafayette in the Broadway sensation ""Hamilton."" â€œBoth the gun and the verse are techniques to get somebody to listen.""

Thereâ€™s a definite anger that â€œBlindspottingâ€ shares with ""Do the Right Thing,"" but the film also has shades of ""White Men Canâ€™t Jump,"" ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""Moonlight"" as well as ""Get Out,"" another movie that tackles racism in an immersive fashion.

â€œItâ€™s an exercise in empathy, right?â€ Diggs says of the common ground between ""Blindspotting"" and Jordan Peeleâ€™s acclaimed thriller. â€œAt least you have an opportunity to feel a little piece of it and be like, â€˜Thatâ€™s not a good feeling.â€™ Just the awareness and understanding of that is huge.â€

A former national slam poetry champion who was a regular on HBOâ€™s ""Def Poetry,"" Casal adds that â€œitâ€™s unfeelable but itâ€™s not unknowable. The important thing is just to normalize the conversation and give some vocabulary around it. Sometimes you just need something to point at and go, â€˜That scene right there. That is my lived experience every day.â€™ â€

3APP19WN72W9NQV745VMUVANID1G69,Russian 'agent' faces charges of seeking to infiltrate US govt,"Washington (AFP) â€“ If Maria Butina was a covert agent sent to Washington by Moscow, she was pretty open about it.

The 29-year-old Russian, who appears in a Washington court Wednesday to face charges that she sought to â€œinfiltrateâ€ the US government, seemed to appear everywhere the Republican leaders and power brokers and shakers gathered.

In 2015, she was the first to get then-candidate Donald Trump to expound publicly about his Russia policy.

She posed for pictures with figures like Senator Rick Santorum, National Rifle Association chief Wayne LaPierre, and Republican governors Rick Scott and Bobby Jindal, posting the snaps on social media.

She told colleagues at the American University graduate school in Washington, where she was a student, that she had a nearly direct line to Russian leader Vladimir Putin â€” which was true.

Displaying a flair with handguns and automatic rifles, she was a VIP at the NRA, arguably the most powerful conservative lobby in the United States.

But according to a federal indictment, Butinaâ€™s very public activities masked the work of a â€œcovert Russian agentâ€ with a plan to spearhead Moscowâ€™s influence in President Trumpâ€™s Republican Party.

â€“ Charged with â€˜conspiracy â€˜ â€“

Her arrest was announced Monday shortly after Trump held a summit with Putin in Helsinki, where Trump pledged to improve bilateral relations and dismissed US intelligence allegations that Moscow interfered in the 2016 election on Trumpâ€™s behalf.

She was charged with conspiracy and acting illegally as an agent for the Russian government without registering.

On Wednesday Moscow said her arrest aimed to undermine the gains made in the summit.

â€œThis happened with the obvious task of minimizing the positive effect,â€ of the Trump-Putin meeting, said foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.

The indictment and an accompanying FBI affidavit describe an alleged secret plan for Butina, masquerading as a visiting student, â€œto conduct activities as an illegal agent of the Russian Federation in the United States through a Russian influence operation.â€

She worked directly for close Putin ally Alexander Torshin, formerly a senior member of the upper house of Russianâ€™s parliament, and now deputy governor of the Russian central bank.

But in a court filing Wednesday, the FBI said she â€œwas in contact with officials believed to be Russian intelligence operatives,â€ including the FSB, Moscowâ€™s federal security service.

Court documents and other records suggest she and Torshin developed plans to â€œinfiltrateâ€ US political society as early as 2011, when Torshin met then-NRA president David Keene and Butina launched a mirror Russian gun rights group, â€œThe Right to Bear Arms.â€

â€“ Asked Trump about Russia in 2015 â€“

In 2013 she befriended a well-known Republican operative, not identified in the indictment but widely reported to be Paul Erickson. The two began a romantic relationship and he opened a wide door for her in Washington.

She became a â€œlife memberâ€ of the NRA and, with its sponsorship, attended numerous conservative and gun rights conferences. She addressed a camp for young Republicans in South Dakota, and stopped by at local US gun stores and shooting ranges.

Her social media accounts show the redhead at an NRA national convention in short, tight cutoff jeans, and a black cowboy hat and cowboy boots, testing a range of powerful firearms.

In July 2015, Butina was selected to ask Trump a question about his plans for ties with Russia at a rally in Las Vegas.

â€œI believe I would get along very nicely with Putinâ€¦. I donâ€™t think youâ€™d need the sanctions,â€ he said, in possibly his first campaign trail pronouncement on the issue.

Her activities ramped up after she moved to the US capital on a student visa in 2016, when she lived with Erickson. She helped arrange a visit by Torshin and other Russian officials, as they sought to construct a â€œback channelâ€ network of sympathetic Americans with political influence.

She also sought, according to a court filing Wednesday to get a job with a lobby group, and â€œofferedâ€¦.sex in exchange.â€

The aim, her messages with Torshin expressed, was to turn around strained US-Russia relations.

â€œThis is the battle for the future, it cannot be lost! Or everyone will lose,â€ Torshin told her in direct messages on Twitter, according to court documents.

But by 2015 â€” well before Moscowâ€™s meddling in the 2016 election was exposed â€” FBI counterintelligence agents saw her as an espionage threat.

The indictment said Butinaâ€™s and Torshinâ€™s aim was nefarious: â€œto penetrate the US national decision-making apparatus to advance the agenda of the Russian Federation.â€",https://www.breitbart.com/news/russian-agent-faces-charges-of-seeking-to-infiltrate-us-govt/,"['Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Democratic']","['3', '4', '2', '2', '5']"
3UQ1LLR26BQQWKLB599ENSHHADDLAA,U.S. states make last-minute legal bid to halt 3-D online guns,"By Tina Bellon

(Reuters) - Several U.S. states said on Monday that they would jointly sue the Trump administration in a last-ditch effort to block the public from being able to download blueprints for 3-D printable guns.

The blueprints are set to go online on Wednesday, following a June settlement between the U.S. government and Texas-based Defense Distributed that allows the company to legally publish the designs.

The states will ask a federal judge to issue a restraining order and an injunction to block the publication, Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson said at a news conference in Seattle.

Along with Washington state, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Oregon, Maryland, and the District of Columbia are working on finalizing the lawsuit and plan on filing it later on Monday, Ferguson said.

The states behind the lawsuit argue that publishing blueprints would allow criminals easy access to weapons. Gun rights advocates say fears about 3-D printed guns are largely overblown, based on current technology.

A series of mass shootings in the United States has brought a long-simmering debate over the country's gun laws to the fore, with Democrat lawmakers increasingly calling for greater restrictions.

Defense Distributed had challenged an earlier government ban as a violation of its First and Second Amendment rights to free speech and to bear arms. It says on its website that it plans to release the plans by Aug. 1.

In a statement on Monday, the State Department said that the decision to settle the case was made in the interests of the security and foreign policy of the United States and in consultation with the Justice Department.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

But the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had failed to adequately explain why it settled the case and allowed the publication of the blueprints, Ferguson said.

""Our Congress has carefully crafted laws to protect us and, in one moment, without any consultation with experts, the administration undoes it,"" he said.

The U.S. State Department had previously banned the blueprints as a national security risk and a violation of arms trafficking regulations. As recently as April, the government in court filings argued downloadable guns would allow extremist groups and criminals abroad unfettered access to arms.

The government failed to study the impact of its decision and did not consult with other agencies before settling, making its actions ""arbitrary and capricious,"" in violation of federal law, Ferguson said. He said the settlement also violated states' rights to regulate firearms.

Gun rights groups have been largely dismissive of concerns over 3-D printable guns, pointing out that the technology is expensive and the guns unreliable. They also say such guns are still subject to federal laws, such as a requirement that all guns contain metal parts, and state laws that require serial numbers.

Defense Distributed is a Texas-based company founded by self-declared anarchist and former law school student Cody Wilson in 2012 as an online, open-source organization developing digital firearm files.

Its files include 3-D printable blueprints for a plastic AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle, a version of a weapon that has been used in many U.S. mass shootings, as well as other firearms.

Defense Distributed did not reply to a request for comment on Monday. A lawyer for the company during a court hearing on Friday said legal requests to halt the publication of the blueprints were an attempt to litigate a political dispute in court.

Gun control groups on Friday failed to convince a federal judge to intervene to block the publication.

Pennsylvania on Sunday said it had reached an agreement with Defense Distributed to make its firearms plans inaccessible to users in the state. But Pennsylvania is still planning to sue the Trump administration over the issue.

(Chris Neal/The Topeka Capital-Journal via AP)

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach stepped aside from his duties as the state's top elections official Friday until his hotly contested Republican primary challenge to Gov. Jeff Colyer is resolved, but Colyer argued that Kobach still has a conflict of interest because Kobach is handing his responsibilities to his top deputy.

Kobach rejected Colyer's accusations that the advice he has been giving local elections on handling ballots violates state law. And the secretary of state -- who has boosted his career by extrapolating scattered cases of election irregularities into claims of a serious election fraud problem -- chastised Colyer in a letter over statements that, Kobach said, could undermine public confidence in the state's elections.

Colyer had demanded in his own letter Thursday that Kobach stop providing guidance to county officials as they counted late mail-in ballots from Tuesday's election and prepared to count other ballots next week.

""Although I would discharge my duties ethically, impartially, and responsibly, I have carefully considered your request and have decided that it is in the best interest of the citizens of Kansas that I permit another to perform the duties of the secretary of state until the conclusion of the 2018 primary election process,"" Kobach wrote.

Kobach's duties will go to Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rucker. Colyer was pressing Kobach to have state Attorney General Derek Schmidt advise county election officials -- something Kobach argued isn't allowed by law.

Colyer spokesman Kendall Marr called Rucker ""a good and decent man"" but said assigning Kobach's duties to someone Kobach can fire ""at any time"" does not address ""the clear conflict of interest that exists.""

Schmidt already is anticipating the possibility of a lawsuit challenging the election results by Colyer or Kobach and sent a letter to county election officials, reminding them to preserve ""any paper files, notes, or electronic data related in any way"" to the election.

Updated totals with late mail-in ballots from all 105 counties counted left Kobach's lead over Colyer at 110 votes out of more than 313,000 cast, less than the 191 votes recorded the morning after Tuesday's election. Under state law, mail-in ballots are counted if they were postmarked Tuesday and arrive in county election offices by Friday.

Kobach is a conservative lightning rod who alienates even some fellow Republicans, but he is perhaps President Donald Trump's closest political ally in Kansas and had Trump's tweeted endorsement. Colyer, backed by the National Rifle Association and a strong abortion opponent, is trying to avoid becoming the first Kansas governor to lose a primary since 1956. The winner will move on to the November general election, where state Sen. Laura Kelly, of Topeka, is the Democratic candidate.

Colyer has accused Kobach of giving county election officials guidance ""not consistent with Kansas law,"" and said Friday on Fox News that he was worried that some mail-in ballots were not being counted as required.

In addition to counting mail-in ballots, county officials must review nearly 9,000 provisional ballots, given to voters at the polls when their eligibility is in question. The counties have until Aug. 20 to finish. Colyer's campaign on Friday announced plans to have representatives in all 105 counties when provisional ballots are reviewed.

The secretary of state's role in the actual counting of ballots is limited: His office provides guidance, compiles statewide vote tallies and provides general supervision.

Kobach said Rucker also will serve on the three-member state board that will certify the primary's final results by Aug. 31. Colyer is also a member of that board, and Kobach called on him to let Lt. Gov. Tracey Mann serve on the board instead. Colyer did not say whether he would do so.

Kobach also defended previous actions, saying his advice on handling ballots was in keeping with state law and longstanding practices. He wrote to Colyer: ""As governor of Kansas, your unrestrained rhetoric has the potential to undermine the public's confidence in the election process.""

Kobach is a vocal advocate of tough voter identification laws and served as vice chairman of Trump's now-disbanded election fraud commission. He publicly backed Trump's unsubstantiated claims that several million illegal ballots may have been cast in the 2016 election, costing Trump the popular vote.

States vary considerably in who has authority over elections. In most, either an elected secretary of state is the chief election official or a lieutenant governor has those duties, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

In Georgia, Secretary of State Kemp, now the GOP nominee for governor, has faced calls to step down from his position, which oversees elections. His spokesman said he had no plans to resign, even though two predecessors, one from each party, did so over the past 25 years in seeking higher office.

And in Kentucky in 2014, Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat, stayed in office while she ran for U.S. Senate, challenging longtime Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell. Although she did not face calls to step down, McConnell used the fact that she was drawing a state paycheck as a line of attack.

Blake Bortles' uneven quarterbacking often elicits substantial flak from NFL fans.

But his Jaguars teammates and franchise â€” Bortles received a three-year, $54 million extension after last season's run to the AFC Championship Game â€” have staunchly stood behind him professionally and, more importantly, personally.

Maybe even more of the Jacksonville community will fall in line after Bortles' gesture in the wake of Sunday's mass shooting at a local Madden tournament.

The Blake Bortles Foundation provided free meals to first responders at Jacksonville Landing in the tragedy's aftermath, and they came with a hand-written note of appreciation from the 26-year-old passer.

31HLTCK4BMDU2GA85D3U6NQMZ3QGVS,Social media offers NRA 'thoughts and prayers' for going broke,"They're sending their ""Thoughts and Prayers"" to the NRA.

The Twittersphere had a snarky response Saturday to the National Rifle Association's claim that it's going broke, responding by sending exactly the same cliche that gun-loving politicians use when every time there's another mass shooting.

""Don't send money,"" Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr tweeted. ""Thoughts and prayers should suffice.""

The powerful, deep-pocketed gun lobby -- which gave a record $21â€‰million to Donald Trump's 2016 campaign -- says it may soon be ""unable to exist,"" according court documents revealed Friday.

It's blaming Gov. Cuomo for launching a ""blacklisting campaign"" that goaded financial institutions and insurers to cut their ties to the lobby.

Cuomo was among those to offer his tongue-in-cheek condolences.

""If the @NRA goes bankrupt because of the State of New York, they'll be in my thoughts and prayers,"" he tweeted.

""I'll see you in court,"" he added, a reference to a federal lawsuit the NRA has filed against New York state.

""Thoughts and Prayers"" have also been offered by comedian Chelsea Handler, activist Linda Sarsour and Rep. Brendan Boyle of Philadelphia.

Also Saturday, dozens of anti-NRA protesters rallied outside the lobbying group's headquarters in Fairfax, Va. -- among them parents and survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla.",https://nypost.com/2018/08/05/social-media-offers-nra-thoughts-and-prayers-for-going-broke/,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Republican', 'Strongly Democratic']","['5', '4', '5', '2', '3']"
3W31J70BATE35T0R4NT4ENUQLDRCKS,Left Mauls Ivanka Trump for Expressing Heartache over Jacksonville Shooting,"Ivanka Trump expressed heartache over the shooting in Jacksonville on Sunday and the left responded by mauling her on social media.

Trump made clear that all the details on the shooting were not in yet, but she wanted to go ahead and let people know she and her family were watching and hurting for the victims:

As we await further details, our hearts are with Jacksonville and all those affected by todayâ€™s tragic mass shooting. â€” Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) August 26, 2018

The left pounced.

Pastor Pavlovitz tweeted: â€œYour father is in bed with NRA, he has removed barriers to mentally ill people getting weapons, and unless the perpetrator is a person of color, he will not give a damn. We have all the details we need.â€

Pavlovitz tweet is inaccurate. What President Trump did was remove an Obama-era gun control that denied Second Amendment rights to Social Security recipients who required a third party to help manage finances, due to a mental health issue. The end of the Social Security gun ban had nothing to do with people other Social Security beneficiaries.

Another Twitter user replied to Ivanka Trumpâ€™s tweet:

After #Parkland you &amp; your father had an opportunity to affect real change in gun reform. Instead you chose the NRA. Your time in the White House is coming to an end. Youâ€™ll leave knowing when you had a chance to save childrenâ€™s lives, you took the easy way out &amp; stayed silent. â€” KCazares (@cazarespr) August 27, 2018

After Parkland, the state of Florida adopted waiting periods for long gun purchases, raised the minimum age for long gun purchases to 21, and empowered police to seize firearms via gun confiscation orders. These gun controls all came at the behest of gun controllers and not one of them prevented the attack in Jacksonville.

CBS News reports that Ivanka Trump received roughly 3,500 negative reactions to her expression of heartache over the shooting.

3RIHDBQ1NFGPCPBABRKL4RJANM5HMD,"Ethan Sonneborn, 14, is on the ballot for Vermont governor","BURLINGTON, Vt. â€” In less than 24 hours, Ethan Sonneborn, a Democratic candidate for governor of Vermont, was set to face off against four opponents at a televised forum. He needed to stand out against a crowded primary field and make enough of an impact to overcome his low name recognition. So his opening statement was crucial.

â€œI want to be almost exclusively focused on the economy in my opening statement, because no other candidate has a monopoly on the economy,â€ he told his campaign manager, Miles Burgess, and his chief of staff, Alex Yaggy. â€œLetâ€™s add in a line about raising the minimum wage.â€

Sonneborn leaned back into a cozy beige sectional and began to dictate while Burgess took notes on a yellow legal pad.

It was a perfectly normal campaign meeting except in one important way: Sonneborn is 14 years old. And so is his senior staff (although, to be fair, Yaggy will turn 15 on primary day.)

On an overcast Wednesday afternoon, in the waning days of summer vacation, the three boys sat inside doing debate prep at Sonnebornâ€™s house and noshing on banana bread that his mother has set out for them.

And they were dead serious about it. The TV in the den displayed a write-up of the Republican primary debate, which they dissected like the salty, weathered politicos that they are not. As Sonneborn talked, Burgess occasionally offered suggestions while Yaggy pushed the candidate to be more specific when rhetoric got the better of him. â€œEvery politician says jobs and small business are backbones of the economy and you just did it,â€ he interjects after one particularly gilded line.

Journey to candidacy

â€œIs this legal?â€ his campaign website asks rhetorically.

Yep! Unlike most states, Vermont has no age requirement for gubernatorial candidates, only a residency requirement. Sonneborn, who has lived in Bristol for 14 years â€” his entire life â€” makes the cut.

Sonneborn declared his candidacy for governor back in August 2017, and then told his parents about it. After the secretary of state consulted with the attorney general, it was decided that he would be allowed to run, but his parents would have to sign a form acknowledging that they knew he was running and didnâ€™t oppose him doing so.

No big! He got their permission.

With that out of the way, Sonneborn had to gather the necessary signatures to actually get on the ballot. Could he do it? Yes he could! A beaming Sonneborn delivered the signatures in May.

With all those hurdles cleared, could Sonneborn . . . actually win the Democratic nomination on Aug. 14?

Probably not. Age aside, he is hamstrung by very low name recognition, a problem that his adult Democratic opponents face as well. But hey, nobody thought a 14-year-old would actually run, let alone land himself on the ballot, let alone participate â€” and hold his own â€” against his adult competitors in several candidate forums.

Sonneborn thinks he can do it. â€œMy campaign transcends age,â€ he said. He possesses a preternatural self-assurance thatâ€™s not uncommon among politicians, but certainly is among teenagers who typically navigate the cutthroat politics of high school, not state government.

If he wins, heâ€™ll appear on the general election ballot as the Democratic nominee. Though itâ€™s unlikely that Sonneborn will unseat Republican Gov. Phil Scott this November since the race is considered safely Republican, if he does somehow make it that far, â€œthatâ€™s up to the attorney general,â€ Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos said.

â€˜Youâ€™ve got to get involvedâ€™

In the wake of the Parkland shooting, political observers have been asking whether the subsequent student-led protests would lead to more participation from the youngest generations. Right now, a Washington Post analysis shows that young voters arenâ€™t on track to sway the outcome of the midterm elections.

But one of the most fascinating subplots of the 2018 election cycle is that there are numerous teenagers running for office. Just in Vermont, thereâ€™s also Finnian Boardman Abbey, 16, who is running for state Senate. And in Kansas, several teenagers ran for governor, drawing national media attention. These young candidates donâ€™t just want people to vote, they want people to vote for them.

Long before Parkland, Sonneborn was determined to make young people a bigger part of the political process, starting with himself. Heâ€™d served as a page in the Vermont state legislature this year, but even then, he had his eye on a much higher office.

When you ask him why heâ€™s running, heâ€™ll tell you itâ€™s â€œto win.â€ He doesnâ€™t postulate what would happen if he loses, even if heâ€™s asked repeatedly over the course of several interviews.

But, in addition to his gubernatorial ambitions, Sonneborn, a staunch progressive, wants his campaign to inspire young voters.

â€œItâ€™s on us to build our own future,â€ he said. â€œYouâ€™ve got to get involved, youâ€™ve got to vote, youâ€™ve got to knock on doors. Itâ€™s how weâ€™re going to make the changes we want to see in the state, in this country, in this world. When we get involved, we make our democracy stronger.â€

â€œI give a lot of credit to Ethan,â€ Condos said. Heâ€™d met Sonneborn and found him to be â€œa smart young, energetic guy who is engaged in civil discourse. He should be commended for taking an action to try to promote the attitudes of young adults.â€

â€œI think Ethanâ€™s candidacy symbolizes that age doesnâ€™t matter, ideas matter, honesty matters,â€ said Jack Bergeson, one of the teenagers who ran for governor of Kansas. The two candidates got to know each other over the course of their campaigns; Bergeson even visited Sonneborn in Vermont.

â€œHe has as good ideas as any politicians in our times have. He does care. The issues really do matter to him. If he gets elected, he can make Vermont better than it already is,â€ Bergeson said.

The great debate

On Thursday evening, the day after debate prep, Sonnenborn strode into the studio of Channel 17 Town Meeting Television for the Democratic primary forum, decked out in a pressed navy suit and an immaculately tied tie.

His parents, Dan and Jenna, and his 12-year-old sister, Julia, were there. But as the cameras prepared to roll and the small studio audience got settled in, he made quiet small talk with his adult opponents.

Sonneborn aside, the Democratic field is an interesting collection of candidates. There is environmental activist James Ehlers; Christine Hallquist, who used to run the Vermont Electric Cooperative and would be the first transgender woman to become a major party nominee for governor if she wins the primary; Brenda Siegel, a single mother who wants to end the opioid crisis; and state Sen. John Rodgers, who isnâ€™t actually on the ballot and rejects traditional politicking.

Once they go live, Sonnebornâ€™s all business. â€œI am running to be the change candidate,â€ he declares. He loves a good rhetorical flourish (â€œWe as a state are only as strong as our weakest linkâ€) and occasionally struggles to come up with them off the cuff, resulting in some lengthy Obama-esque pauses.

.@RealESonnebornâ€™s closing remarks â¬‡ï¸ pic.twitter.com/23IyEAm6jN â€” Vermont Democrats (@VTdems) August 2, 2018

But sometimes, his age and his platform align to his advantage, such as when the issue of gun control in Vermont came up. Because when he talked about school safety, he was talking about his own school and his own safety.

â€œSchool shooters are not well-regulated militias. People who are stockpiling assault weapons are not well-regulated militias,â€ he said. â€œI think we have to move to a system where we put safety first.â€

â€œI think that means we tackle mental-health issues, I think it means we tackle school safety issues, and I think it means we tackle gun issues.â€

What was most remarkable was not how his age affected his candidacy, but how it didnâ€™t. Nobody â€” not the moderator, not his opponents, not audience members who submitted questions â€” raised the subject or asked him if this was a good idea. It had come up in earlier interviews, but today, Sonneborn was just another candidate.

After the forum, Ehlers, who had delivered many of his talking points in a somber monotone while the cameras were rolling, bounded, beaming, over to Sonnebornâ€™s dad and gave his hand a hearty shake.

Hallquist, who had dutifully stuck to her talking points about education and political divisiveness during an interview with The Post earlier that day, lit up when Sonneborn was mentioned. â€œItâ€™s been real fun having him on the ballot,â€ she said.

Sylvia and Cora Burkman, ages 14 and 10, had sat in the audience with their parents and watched Sonneborn debate. â€œI think it was really cool someone his age was running,â€ Sylvia said. Despite being the same age, she didnâ€™t think she would vote for him. But she agreed with most of his ideas.

The only person who didnâ€™t seem all that impressed was Julia. Sheâ€™s just not that into politics.

Is it a movement, or a moment?

There are moments, such as when Sonneborn struggles to alight on the right snippet of oratory about minimum wage, health care or education, when it becomes clear that so much of politics these days comes down to churning out consistent rhetoric day after day, tweet after tweet. Sonneborn cites Barack Obama, Robert F. Kennedy and Howard Dean as political role models. All were persuasive orators who inspired masses with their words and signature cadences.



Ethan Sonneborn. (Grace Raver)

But Sonneborn is also an emblem of what can happen when a young citizen identifies an issue, finds his voice and decides to get involved in the political process. What can happen when they seize on the power of that rhetoric, and those tweets, and Obama-style grass-roots organizing, and insist that others listen. â€œIâ€™m really inspired by people who are effectively able to build coalitions and who are able to incorporate elements of populism without the nationalism,â€ he said.

Politics is a system that demands participation and rewards those who show up. Sonneborn decided to participate, and though he probably isnâ€™t going to win, he got pretty far by showing up.

Politics also loves young, fresh faces and ideas. In this particular year, the ecosystem has welcomed youthful, diverse politicians such as the oft-referenced Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. These candidates are changing narratives and challenging perceptions of who gets to run, who gets elected, and which voters decide the outcome of the race.

Sonneborn is participating. The Parkland kids are participating. The Kansas teens participated. Will they be a blip in Americaâ€™s history of low youth engagement? Or do they signal a turning point in our politics? Weâ€™ll find out in November.

But as Sonneborn sees it, the goal isnâ€™t even that lofty.

A gun, by its nature, is a polarizing thing. A gun forces us to envision ourselves on either one end of it or the other. A gun is an equalizer, a tool, a symbol of liberty and power and slaughter and loss.

Some of the 21 gathered here saw a gun as an instrument of protection. One kept an AR-15 atop the armoire. A few often wore guns strapped to their bodies, under their clothes.

Others had been threatened with guns. They feared that guns empowered people who would marginalize or silence them. They had been intimidated, mugged, raped. They'd lost mothers and cousins and uncles and friends.

They'd been recruited from around the country and across the political divide in an attempt to see if it was possible to create an experience that might build understanding. They would spend two days learning to listen, and then they'd join 130 others in a conversation on Facebook, where people often go to hear only what they already believe.

None of them were entirely sure what they were getting into.

Here was Malak Wazne, 18. Before this experiment was over, a Michigan teenager a lot like her would be shot at while knocking on a door asking for directions. Would Malak's ideas be welcome?

Here was Dan Zelenka, a lawyer and competitive shooter, who knew just about everything there was to know about guns. He came to teach. Would he also be willing to learn?

Here was Alexis Intili, who could spot a liberal a mile away. ""Dumb idiot morons,"" she called them, to their faces. The marchers outside annoyed her. She would never, ever have anything to learn from a high school kid. What did they know?

In a small room, they sat in a circle, close enough that their knees touched. Group leaders coached them to ask better questions, to avoid marginalizing words, to think about how they naturally embed assumptions inside questions.

""It seems to me that this issue all comes down to safety,"" said Mathilde Wimberly, a retired educator from Metairie, La., who favors gun control. ""My question is, What are you so afraid of? But that's offensive.""

She thought for a moment.

""Can you tell me more about why you feel that you need lots of guns?""

It's the difference, a group leader said, between asking, ""What are you so afraid of?"" and ""What sorts of things make you feel afraid?""

Each person wrote on a Post-it note one thing they wanted the others to understand about them:

""All I want is to come home at the end of the school day.""

""As a law-abiding gun owner, I am not a danger to you.""

""I feel like I'm fighting for my right to be alive.""

Alexis hoped someone would insult President Trump so she could go off. She's from Staten Island, where recently she saw two people have a fistfight in a Dunkin' Donuts over whether the last episode of The Sopranos was any good.

She's comfortable with confrontation. She was primed for it. But emotion?

""I didn't want to listen to other people's damn stories and their crying.""

She's a financial adviser, and in business, she thought, emotion makes you weak. She grew up in an I'll-give-you-something-to-cry-about house in a Republican bubble.

""I never got a chance to know anyone else,"" she said. ""Nor did I want to. I didn't care.""

She's pro-gun, but her niece and nephew, ages 10 and 7, are hiding under desks during lockdown drills at school. So something has to change.

She sized up the others in the group. Too young. Too liberal. Too stupid. But she had asked to be part of this, and she decided to give it her best. Then the other members of the group shared their stories. And she listened.

She heard stories about PTSD, rape, suicide and stone-cold killing.

""There's a lot more to this,"" she said to herself. ""Damn, man. I'm a closed-minded bitch.""

The conversation that began in Washington, D.C., migrated to Facebook, where it included about 150 people over the next month.

Alexis gave up Netflix so she could settle into bed with her laptop each night and take her role in the conversation seriously. Dan checked his Facebook feed almost constantly.

They were forced to consider the roots of their deeply held beliefs. The questions they would ask gave voice to their prejudices and fears.

Why is your personal safety worth more than mine?

If you saw me walking down the street carrying a gun, what would you honestly think?

Is the right to bear arms unalienable, as some believe the Declaration of Independence suggests? Is this right endowed by God, or bestowed by the government in the Bill of Rights? With an eye on history and another on current events, they re-examined language they thought they understood.

Security. Militia. Well-regulated. Free State.

On a warm Sunday morning, on the edge of St. Tammany Parish outside of New Orleans, past Rick's Catfish Cabin and Todd's Country Corner, Dan pulled his Ford Expedition into an earthen quarry and unloaded a bunch of guns.

""My toys,"" he said.

He pulled out his M1A1 Thompson submachine gun, his M1 Garand, his German MP40, his Swedish ""K"", his M1918A2 Browning Automatic Rifle and his German MG42. He also brought along a few AR-15s -- assault rifles, as they're widely known. The guns Dan and his pals shoot every fourth Sunday in friendly competition. The guns he wants to demonstrate and destigmatize, even as they have become the weapon of choice in mass murders across America.

On Facebook, Dan had offered a lengthy explanation to the oft-asked question, Why would anyone need an AR-15? Lots of reasons, he wrote. It's the most popular rifle in America. Adaptable for many types of hunting, easier to shoot accurately than a handgun.

Dan's nephew J.P., a high school sophomore, dragged metal targets across the Louisiana dirt speckled by spent shells that twinkled in the sunlight. Time to shoot.

At age 3, Dan wore toy six-shooters to his aunt's wedding. At 10, his dad bought him a .22 rifle for Christmas. ""Forty-five years worth of guns,"" he said.

Dan likes to shoot, and he loves to defend the Constitution, especially the Second Amendment.

""We are,"" he said, ""the arsenal of democracy.""

His mind was made up. He was so resolute some in the Facebook group thought he was a mole for the National Rifle Association.

Gun crimes are down sharply since the mid-'90s, he pointed out correctly. ""America has gotten safer, but we watch night after night the news about the epidemic of gun violence.""

The problem, then?

""It's the criminals,"" he said. He supports changes to stop violent criminals from getting guns. But he does not support restrictions on broad, ill-defined categories of guns.

""The term assault weapon means nothing and it means everything,"" he said, ""because the term is infinitely expandable to mean whatever they make it up to be. And every time they change it, it expands to include more and more firearms.

""If you really sat down and looked at the numbers -- took all the emotion away -- then you have to support gun rights,"" he said.

He has known four people who have been present at mass shootings. Two young women he met hiking in the Grand Tetons wound up inside a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in July 2012, when a madman opened fire. One of the women took a bullet to the knee. Twelve were killed, 70 injured -- the largest number of casualties in one shooting in modern U.S. history, until the 2016 shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, which held the distinction until the 2017 shooting in Las Vegas, where Dan's old girlfriend had been listening to country music. That's three. The fourth was his friend Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Congressman shot through the hip last year when a man opened fire at a Republican baseball practice near the U.S. Capitol.

On Facebook, Dan posed and then considered the essential question: Are school shootings the price we pay for a certain level of liberty?

""What we should never do is allow the criminal conduct of a few to be the catalyst for the infringement of any right protected by the Constitution,"" he wrote.

Throughout our history, he wrote, we have sent young people to fight for American rights and ideals. ""If someone began attacking our schools demanding that we surrender our freedom of religion or freedom of speech or right to vote, would we comply? I think not. Would we be willing to pay a price in blood to protect our freedom?

""Clearly, if history is an indicator, the answer is yes.""

On this Sunday, Dan coached his nephew, lying on his belly, staring down the scope of a German machine gun that fires 20 rounds per second.

""You're going to have to use some muscle,"" Dan told him. ""Pull it hard. Pull it real hard.""

Behind the scenes of the Facebook conversation, an army of moderators took turns in shifts, helping people craft comments and reframe questions. They nudged women and young people to speak up, and they gently asked a couple of white guys to quit hogging the mic.

Helene Cohen Bludman felt shouted down by Dan and his lawyerly recitation of gun statistics. So the moderators set her up in a one-on-one conversation with Jon Godfrey, a military veteran in New York, who was one of the 21 initial participants in D.C.

Jon talked about living in a rural area, in a house at the end of a long, dark driveway, where police response times were not comforting. He told her about the gun he leaves with his wife when he's away. He put together a presentation for Helene illustrating the things they had in common: sports, dogs, grandchildren.

""I felt myself understanding for the first time,"" said Helene, a freelance writer from Bryn Mawr, Pa. ""Honestly, this was such an epiphany for me. I did not change my feelings about guns, but I understood that good, smart people could feel differently.""

Three people got kicked out of the Facebook group. A few faded away. The moderators struggled with how to handle the mansplainers. Were people participating or advocating? Would pulling them aside help?

They read 13,500 posts and replies in the course of the month.

""The litmus test was are people trying? Do they want to have this conversation?"" said Eve Pearlman, the co-founder of Spaceship Media, the firm that helped lead the conversation. ""If they are, we can work with them on the habits they've worked on over a lifetime. If they want to keep trying, we can keep trying with them.""

Brittany Walker Pettigrew, another moderator, found herself scrolling comments on her lunch hour at her day job when she came across one that made her freeze. The post, by a white male gun-rights supporter, was an attempt to answer the question ""Why do people need to own guns?"" It has since been edited, but it said, in essence, I need my guns like Rosa Parks ""needed"" to sit at the front of the bus.

For Brittany, a 45-year old African-American child-welfare manager in Oakland, Calif., that post was so blatantly offensive that she had to sit down.

She and the other moderators debated how to handle things. Was this guy racist? Should he be banned? But Brittany, channeling the spirit of the group, decided to talk to him and try to explain why people just can't bring Rosa Parks into all this.

Afterward, Brittany wasn't entirely sure if the man understood. But she realized that he had actually been trying to say something useful. And then, over time, something much more powerful started to sink in.

""I was heard. And I heard him,"" she said. ""And there's nobody in my family that has ever spoken to a white person about racism and not been killed for it.""

In the end, they didn't propose legislation or draft a resolution or circulate a petition. They didn't even change their minds.

""We explicitly don't have the goal of changing minds,"" said Eve. ""There is such a breakdown in public spaces for civil discourse. The act of humanizing each other is itself the goal.""

But one weekend in April, Helene, the freelance writer from Pennsylvania, was organizing a community march for gun violence, passing around handouts, when she scanned the suggestions for protest signs and cringed. ""The NRA is evil.""

That would not have bothered her before, but now she knew that NRA members don't like to be called evil any more than liberals like to be called socialists. Her experience in the group helped her learn to listen again.

""Now that extends to when I have conversations that are not about gun violence,"" she said. ""I see the shades of gray where before I couldn't.""

Alexis, the Staten Island financial adviser, swears the change she felt in D.C. has been lasting. She considers her D.C. counterparts friends for life. Even the liberals. She never wants to return to the closed-minded, bubble-dwelling name caller she used to be. When she got into a disagreement with a work colleague, she says she suppressed the reflex to call him ""dumb idiot moron,"" and instead said, ""Tell me why you feel that way.""

April ended, and so did the conversation -- on official channels, anyway. Ruth Grunberg of Cortland, N.Y., started a book club for members of the group, and they got too busy chatting to read any actual books. Ade'Kamil Kelly of East Orange, N.J., recorded a podcast.

Dan, the Louisiana lawyer, attended the NRA convention in Dallas. Alexis went to a business meeting in Las Vegas, where gun laws are as loose as the necklines, so she asked Dan where she should go to shoot something big. He directed her to Battlefield Vegas, where Alexis said she paid $330 to shoot an AK-47, a Smith &amp; Wesson .500 Magnum revolver, a German MG42 machine gun and a Barrett M107A1 .50-caliber sniper rifle.

She wanted to feel a kickback that knocked her out of her shoes. The weight of the guns. The flames shooting out of the barrel. The smell of hot metal and powder. The thunder that made people around her back up. The vibrations from the guns firing in the lanes beside her. She wanted to embrace the moment when she, a 45-year-old financial adviser, fired a gun that could blow a plane out of the sky.

And then she thought: ""You could shoot down a room full of people in seconds.""

And: ""What if one of these other people in here is crazy?""

And: ""Why are these guns even around?""

And: ""It's not worth everybody being slaughtered.""

Dan would never forgive her for saying it, she thought, but ban them. Ban automatics. Ban semi-automatics too.

Then, on May 18, Santa Fe High School.

Alexis heard when she got back from Las Vegas. The details were blurry. Was it eight kids dead? Was it only eight this time?

Only?

Other members of the Facebook group took in the news having mostly returned to the bubbles of their lives. Malak, who had joined the conversation knowing she represented both Muslims and high school students, got the news in theater class in Dearborn, Mich. She walked from fifth period to sixth watching the live feed on her phone. The feeling among her friends was one of defeat, a collective shrug.

It was eight kids dead, in fact. And two teachers. Thirteen injured. The shooter, a 17-year-old in a trench coat, used a pump-action shotgun and a .38 revolver owned legally by his father.

David Preston, a courier in Mobile, Ala., who was robbed at gunpoint years ago while delivering pizzas, wrote a public post on his personal Facebook page: ""What is going to be The Narrative of the gun grabbers when it is revealed that the Texas school shooter used a Remington 870 instead of an AR-15?""

David says he was working for Papa John's when a gunman ordered him to hand over his tip money. Thirty-five bucks. The next day he bought a gun.

Helene had accepted his friend request just days before. Now he was calling the Parkland students pawns of a liberal media.

Helene thought it wouldn't matter to the families of those dead kids what kind of weapon it was, and she felt all the old familiar powerlessness and resignation and despair.

Had they learned anything, really? Would any of them change? Not their minds -- that had never been the point. But their hearts?

Helene clicked his profile, and then she clicked:

Unfriend.

So where does it all lead? As each of them take whatever kernel of empathy or understanding or consternation into the rest of their lives, what will they reap? If an experiment doesn't produce a new law or at least a campaign slogan, did it do any good? In Staten Island, Alexis is organizing a splinter group, hoping to repeat the project. She figures her neighbors are stubborn like her, and the group leaders had better bring their A-game. Another new group is starting in Alabama.

Last month, MassLive.com, an Advance Local newsroom in Massachusetts, led a new group in a two-day moderated gun conversation that mirrored the one in D.C.

A woman who had lost a son, a mom who had been shot in the face and a hunter still in his camo all came together and felt the same connection and sense of wanting to do ... something.

They stood in a circle when it was over and tried to articulate their hopes.

""I want my words to have power.""

""I want to make people who look like me less threatening.""

""I want to grow as a person, and be better.""

About this project

""Guns: An American Conversation"" convened people on opposite sides of the social and political spectrum to engage in a dialogue around the polarizing topic of guns. The project began with a workshop for 21 participants on March 24 and 25 at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., and expanded to 150 people who participated in a monthlong moderated Facebook group. It was launched by a coalition of American newsrooms owned by Advance Local, in partnership with the journalism organization Spaceship Media, Essential Partners and TIME.

Staff at a Maryland newspaper have published a Friday edition after a gunman killed five people and injured two more at the paper's office.

""We are putting out a damn paper tomorrow,"" tweeted Chase Cook, a Capital Gazette reporter. Staff worked in the car park to get the paper out.

The gunman, who fired through a glass door into the newsroom on Thursday with a shotgun, was arrested afterwards.

He has been charged with murder and has a bail hearing shortly.

A Capital Gazette reporter tweeted the charge sheet which shows that Jarrod Ramos was charged with five counts of first-degree murder.

The suspect is reported to have unsuccessfully sued the newspaper group in 2012 for defamation.

The paper tweeted the front page of their Friday paper as well as obituaries of their colleagues.

How did the attack happen?

First reports of the shooting came at 14:40 local time (18:40 GMT) on Thursday.

Journalists inside the building posted on social media as the gunman fired through the glass door of the office with a shotgun and shot at staff inside.

An intern at the paper, Anthony Messenger, tweeted as the attacker opened fire.

Fellow staff member Selene San Felice told CNN her first reaction to the shooting had been to lie down under her desk. She tried to get out through a rear door but it was locked.

Crime reporter Phil Davis was also in the building and told The Baltimore Sun - part of the same media group as the Gazette - that he and his colleagues had hidden under their desks.

""I don't know why he stopped [shooting],"" he told the paper.

He described the scene as ""like a war zone"" and tweeted about his experiences as he waited to be interviewed by police.

County executive Steve Schuh told CNN the suspect had been hiding under a desk in the building when police officers arrived ""within 60 seconds"" of receiving news of the incident. There was ""no exchange of fire"", he added.

""This was a targeted attack on the Capital Gazette,"" said William Krampf, deputy chief of Anne Arundel County Police. He added that the gunman had ""entered the building with a shotgun and looked for his victims as he walked through the lower level"".

Speaking to reporters, Mr Krampf said an item ""we believed to be an explosive device"" had been found at the premises and destroyed. It turned out to be a smoke bomb, he said

Police say they safely evacuated 170 people from the building, which housed 30 other businesses.

Who are the victims?

The authorities have named the dead as:

Wendi Winters, 65, editor and community reporter

Rebecca Smith, 34, sales assistant

Robert Hiaasen, 59, assistant editor and columnist

Gerald Fischman, 61, editorial writer

John McNamara, 56, reporter and editor

The Committee to Protect Journalists tweeted that before the Maryland shooting, seven journalists had been killed in the US in relation to their work since 1992.

Most recently, TV reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward were killed in 2015 during an interview in Moneta, Virginia.

Who is the suspect?

The Gazette reportedly wrote an article in 2011 about a woman who said Jarrod Ramos was stalking her, and he failed in his attempts to sue the paper for defamation the following year.

Police did not ascribe any motive after arresting him following Thursday's attack.

Ramos is scheduled for a bail hearing on Friday morning in Annapolis.

What reaction was there to the attack?

Federal agencies, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were involved in the response to the attack.

Maryland governor Larry Hogan said on Twitter he was ""absolutely devastated"" and was in contact with authorities.

President Donald Trump tweeted that his ""thoughts and prayers"" were with the victims and their families.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders later condemned the attack on ""innocent journalists doing their job"".

The New York City Police Department (NYPD) said it had deployed counterterrorism teams to media organisations in and around New York City as a precaution.

Mayor of Annapolis Gavin Buckley told the Guardian he could not understand how the paper ""could make someone that hostile"".

""If this is an attack on journalism it is a sad state of affairs,"" he said. ""Because journalists, you don't get paid enough to put your life on the line, we're not in some war zone, we're not in some third-world country with a dictator.""

Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen responded to a Gazette reporter on Twitter.

Writer and alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos has faced criticism online for writing that he ""can't wait for the vigilante squads to start gunning journalists down"".

3YLPJ8OXX9V6UPMJAR2BLJQ4PL3X4R,"Jacksonville shooting victims identified as gamers Taylor Robertson, Eli Clayton","The two victims killed at a ""Madden NFL 19"" tournament have been identified as the winner of last year's Madden Classic competition and a former high school football player who won tens of thousands of dollars playing his favorite video game. Taylor Robertson, a 27-year-old from Giles, West Virginia, and Eli Clayton, a 22-year-old from Woodland Hills, California, were both shot and killed by a gunman in Jacksonville, Florida, at a Madden NFL 19 qualifier event.

Robertson was identified by Dot City Gaming, the professional esports team of which he was a member. The team mourned both victims of Sunday's shooting.

""They were great competitors and well-loved members of the Madden community,"" the team tweeted. ""Our thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to their families, loved ones, and all of those affected by this tragedy.""

Robertson, known by his gaming handle ""SpotMePlzzz,"" won $80,500 over the course of his professional gaming career, according to his EASports.com profile. He took home the Madden Classic championship in 2016.

Facebook

In a YouTube video posted by EA Sports, Robertson said he had played Madden NFL since he was 10 and started playing competitively a few years ago.

Derek Jones, a fellow gamer who lost to Robertson in 2016, said his onetime rival was ""one of the nicest people I ever met.""

""There's no way that guy did anything to deserve to get shot,"" Jones said, who went to the Florida tournament from Santa Fe, New Mexico. ""He's got a family at home, and he just came out here to try to win some money for this family.""

Shay Kivlen is another gamer friend who had known Robertson for about five years and had seen him about six times a year at various gaming tournaments.

""He was one of the kindest people, most genuine guys I've ever met,"" Kivlen said. ""He was super real, and that's what I loved about him. If he was happy, you knew he was happy. He wore his emotions on his sleeve.""

Kivlen had left the tournament Sunday to take a nap at his hotel about 20 minutes before the attack. He was watching a live stream of the tournament online when the gunfire erupted.

Clayton was a former high school football player who was known as ""one of the perennial top competitors in the scene,"" according to his profile on EASports.com. He won $51,000 in tournaments in his gaming career.

Clayton, who played under the name ""TrueBoy,"" graduated from Calabasas High School in 2014. In a statement, the school said the ""entire community is shocked and saddened by this loss.""

His former high football team, the Calabasas Coyotes, mourned him on Twitter. ""We send our love, condolences, and deepest sense of sorrow to Elijah's Family and Friends,"" the team said.

Clayton's parents and other relatives gathered outside police headquarters Monday in Jacksonville to give a brief statement. A cousin, Brandi Pettijohn, said the family was ""devastated by yet another senseless act of gun violence."" She said Clayton was a good, peaceful man who never had a fistfight.

""He loved football, and out of all the videogames he could play, he settled on and mastered 'Madden,'"" she said. ""He made a good living gaming, and he saved his earnings so he could afford to go to college to continue his education.""

The suspected gunman was identified as David Katz, 24, of Baltimore, Maryland. Katz used a single handgun to carry out the shooting and died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said. Before the shooting, he had been defeated in the tournament.

Kivlen and Jones said they barely knew Katz, who seemed to avoid conversation with fellow players during tournaments. Katz's gameplay was often erratic, Kivlen said.

""He would do kind of weird stuff online that other people wouldn't do. He would catch a ball and just start jumping out of bounds and stuff when he could have gotten more yards, just hurting himself,"" Kivlen said. ""I don't know what he was doing.""

Nine others were wounded by gunfire and two others were injured as they fled the shooting, police said. Players were competing for a chance to play in this year's Madden Classic in Las Vegas.

""It just doesn't make sense why he would do it,"" Kivlen said. ""In 'Madden,' you never get so mad at a loss that you would want to do that.""

When the shots first rang out, witnesses said they thought it was a firecracker or balloons popping. Then panic set in and people were trampled rushing for the exits.

This canâ€™t be America.

It was a common refrain in response to last yearâ€™s torch light rallies, protests and the subsequent murder of Heather Heyer by white supremacists in Charlottesville. High profile events have a tendency to shock the consciousness of our country.

The unfortunate truth for all of us is that it was and is America. But then we move on.

Too many have dismissed actions as coming from a small group at the fringes of our society. They say, â€œWell, thatâ€™s those people down south.â€ â€œItâ€™s not happening in my city.â€ â€œWe elected the first black president.â€

Ignoring racism allows it to grow

But itâ€™s that kind of head-in-the-sand, benign denial of our challenges that allows racism and hate to grow in the first place.

Since Charlottesville, weâ€™ve seen flare ups around the issues of race and identity weekly, from racially-motivated attacks on black athletes to intense police-community protests to the inhumane separation of families based solely on their nationality.

And yet, we never get to the root of some of our most vexing challenges. For generations, race has been a topic always simmering in the background, ready to boil over because weâ€™ve never dealt with it in the first place.

Throughout our nation's history, we have allowed ourselves to be divided by anger, hate and fear. Race today is once again being used as a tool to divide us, to make us think we have less in common than we actually do.

More: I was at the sad white supremacists gathering. It didn't fool me. Their movement is rising.

Pathetic Unite the Right and angry Antifa sputter. There's still time to heed Rodney King.

Ferguson's action at the ballot box sends message to prosecutors: Voters want police held accountable

Many in politics believe we should reject discussions about identity and eschew tough discussions about race.

I think thereâ€™s no better time in our nationâ€™s history to confront the truth about race as a means to bringing people together. We can tackle our toughest challenges only when we face them. For generations, our diversity and multiculturalism have been seen as one of this nationâ€™s great strengths. One of our nationâ€™s mottos â€” â€œe pluribus unum,â€ which means â€œout of many, oneâ€ â€” is based on this very idea. These fundamental and central ideas â€” our freedoms, our diversity, our indivisibility â€” are being challenged and proclaimed as weaknesses by those in charge. They are wrong.

There is nowhere in this country where we have fully reckoned with our past or the issues of race and identity â€” Northeast, Southwest, Midwest, nor anywhere in between. Like most Southerners, I have a particular chip on my shoulder about the caricature of us as backwards, bumbling and racist. But I do believe, as Southerners, we have a special obligation to do more.

We must come together to say in word and deed that we are better together than we are apart. Communities will only thrive if they unite around a common purpose with shared responsibility and opportunity. That is what really makes America great, and today itâ€™s more important than ever to hold fast to these values.

We need not fear the future

It is, of course, also true that the countryâ€™s racial profile is changing. The country is getting more diverse by the year. Rather than fear what is coming, I try to assure my white friends that African-Americans and Latinos will be far better to us than we have been to them. We just have to show people that we have more in common than not.

Thatâ€™s why I am launching a new project, the E Pluribus Unum Fund, in partnership with the Emerson Collective, the organization founded and led by Laurene Powell Jobs. The E Pluribus Unum Fund will bring people together in cities and towns across the South to find common ground and solutions around the issues of race, equity, economic opportunity and violence, proving the American motto that ""out of many, we are one.â€

Over the next year, we will convene community leaders to listen and learn, and we will try to bring people of different races and backgrounds together around our shared values. If we are able to work through the discussion of race, we can then begin moving forward together on creating shared economic opportunity, reforming the criminal justice system, and reducing gun violence.

Only when we are able to bring people together and have truthful conversations about our past can we really chart a better path forward. Now is the time to restore the American ideal that diversity is a strength, that we all come to the table of democracy as equals. We must aspire to fulfill our Founding Fathersâ€™ vision for a more perfect union, where all men and women are created equal. It is in this quest and search for truth that real patriotism is rooted and flourishes. True patriotism must be nourished every day. And, this must be our work.

The South Dakota man who helped shepherd an alleged Russian operative to National Rifle Association and conservative political group meetings had a front-row seat to history and a less than stellar reputation in South Dakota politics.

Once a political provocateur, Paul Erickson virtually disappeared from the state's political scene in recent years despite having residences in both Sioux Falls and the Washington, D.C. area and boasting a Rolodex that allegedly contained some of the biggest names in the conservative universe.

Erickson, 56, landed in hot water with many of his associates, including L. Brent Bozell, III, a descendant of conservative royalty, over a failed business deal that ended up in court.

And this week, the Vermillion native came under the national spotlight when Maria Butina, his business partner, and roommate, was arrested and charged in Washington, D.C.

Prosecutors in court papers said Butina, 29, used sex and deception to develop influential connections. She made her initial appearance in court Wednesday in Washington, D.C.

A 'con man' and a springboard to the national stage

Erickson looked on as Ronald Reagan won his re-election bid, danced on the rubble of the Berlin Wall and celebrated the end of the Civil War in Nicaragua with U.S.-backed contra rebels.

He wrote a Hollywood film, helped convene more than a million men for a religious gathering in Washington, D.C. and ran a TV ad campaign to unseat then-U.S. Sen. Tom Daschle.

And it all started when he took an internship working on James Abdnor's 1980 Senate bid.

""I owe my entire career to him,"" Erickson told the Argus Leader in 2003.

He touted the experience on his resume and claimed success in talking about himself outside South Dakota, but another Republican who worked on the campaign said Erickson slouched on the job.

""He took a paycheck for that job, and he never showed up one day, never lifted a finger to help organize those campuses,"" former state Rep. Lee Schoenbeck said. ""In reality, heâ€™s just a con man.""

It was a reputation that followed him in South Dakota politics, but one he was able to escape outside the state.

He went on to join the National College Republicans, picking up a network of political contacts he'd lean on for decades to come.

'Freedom-fighters' and a fallen wall

In 1981, Erickson worked with anti-communist campaigns to deliver aid to ""freedom fighters"" in Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Angola and Lebanon.

When he heard the Berlin Wall was set to come down in 1989, Erickson boarded a plane and arrived in time to celebrate there.

When he returned to the United States, Erickson went on to run a legal and promotional issue campaign for John Wayne Bobbitt in the aftermath of a much-publicized domestic altercation where his wife, Lorena, that led to the severing of Bobbitt's penis.

And in another controversial move, Erickson worked to get President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire a forum before the United Nations to announce free elections, but Mobutu died before any trip could be made to the United States.

Ties to national Republicans

In the 2000s, Erickson won the support of nationally prominent conservatives.

He struck up a friendship with Stephen Moore, then-president of the Washington-based Club For Growth. And in a 2003 interview with the Argus Leader, Moore said Erickson had ""clever and creative ideas,"" and looked to him for insight into state politics.

""I view him as extremely shrewd; tactically proficient in trying to influence elections,"" Moore said at the time.

In 2002, Erickson was involved in bringing Oliver North, the former Marine Corps officer involved in the Iran-Contra scandal during Reagan's second term, to Augustana University. Reynold Nesiba, an economics professor at Augustana, said it was a controversial moment for the liberal arts school, sparking protests against the conservative hero.

""I think Paul Erickson was probably essential in making that event happen,"" Nesiba said.

The event also allowed Erickson to show his controversial side: He dropped in on a campus Democratic Party event uninvited. He wasn't welcome, Nesiba said.

State GOP officials wary

But in-state Republicans viewed Erickson with suspicion. He started raising money ahead of the 2004 election telling donors that he wanted to launch an ad campaign against Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader who was getting ready to run for a fourth term.

At the time, Daschle didn't have an announced opponent. But most assumed former Rep. John Thune would challenge Daschle. Republican leaders and members of Thune's team were worried that Erickson's aggressive tactics might alienate centrist voters.

""He wanted to get closer to the South Dakota Republican Party than I wanted him to,"" said Randy Frederick, the chairman of the state party at the time.

Frederick said they were worried about ad campaigns that might contain ""half-truths.""

""If you are coming out and telling a half-truth, you will eventually end up getting burned,"" Frederick said.

Business failure

In the late 1990s, Erickson set out to use some of the contacts he had developed over the years to raise money for a nursing home and Alzheimer's care company called Compass Care. Investors were sold on the idea of building 24 facilities that would be Christian based.

Although Erickson raised money, the venture went nowhere. By 2003, the same year in which he was telling donors he wanted to raise money to defeat Daschle, creditors began seeking judgments worth hundreds of thousands of dollars against Compass Care, including on the red Ford Mustang Erickson drove.

More: Scott Walker said he doesn't know accused Russian spy Maria Butina who allegedly offered sex for influence

The creditors included Blue Stem Capital Partners, an investment company founded by former GOP Lt. Gov. Steve Kirby, who ran for governor in 2002.

In 2007, Bozell filed suit against Erickson after losing nearly all of a $200,000 investment into Compass Care. The lawsuit showed how deep Erickson was willing to tap his conservative allies to raise money.

Bozell, the founder of the Media Research Center, a group founded to highlight alleged liberal bias in the media, had an unmatched pedigree within the conservative movement.

His father had been among the post-World War II intellectuals who revived the conservative movement, and his uncle, William F. Buckley, was the founder of National Review, a conservative magazine that for decades represented the zenith in conservative thought.

In his lawsuit, Bozell said he had known Erickson socially for years.

More: Who is the South Dakota man linked to alleged Russian agent Maria Butina?

""Defendant Erickson had from time to time represented to plaintiff Bozell that he was an astute businessman and an accomplished investor of his own and other people's money,"" the lawsuit said.

Erickson, the lawsuit said, promised Bozell that he would double his money. Bozell sued a year and a half after nearly all of his money disappeared.

A court eventually awarded Bozell a judgment of $190,000. Christopher Craig, a lawyer who represented Bozell in the case, said the judgment, which includes interest, was never paid.

""Keep in mind that the judgment is against both Compass Care and Mr. Erickson (he was a guarantor on the underlying debt),"" Craig said in an email.

Keeping a low profile

Some who had known Erickson said they hadn't heard from him in years. Rob Regier, who was involved in the anti-Daschle ad idea and who worked for the conservative South Dakota Family Policy Council, said in an email he hadn't talked to Erickson in about 10 years. Regier currently lives in Kansas City.

""But,"" Regier said by email, ""I've certainly read, about him, plenty!""

Casey Phillips, a political consultant who once worked with Erickson, said the two would text every couple months, and Erickson texted him as recently as Friday.

When asked what Erickson had been doing, Phillips replied: ""Just as vague as ever.""

He saw Erickson on a flight from Minneapolis to Washington, D.C. in June.

""That's the last time I saw him,"" Phillips said in an email. ""This story is WILD.""

3I6NF2WGIHED4MVTZMLH2PWNMIQG5T,Don Blankenship's Senate bid ended by West Virginia Supreme Court,"The West Virginia Supreme Court dismissed a last-minute appeal by ex-coal baron Don Blankenship to add his name to the U.S. Senate ballot as a Constitution Party candidate. The third-place finisher in May's Republican Senate primary was stopped short by the West Virginia Secretary of State, citing a ""sore loser law"" that prevents defeated major party candidates from running under a third party banner.

The court examined state code to determine whether such laws were constitutional or had come into place retroactively, after lawmakers clarified election rules in June. Ultimately, the bench ordered West Virginia's secretary of state ""to take whatever measures are necessary to ensure that Donald L. Blankenship does not appear on the 2018 General Election ballot.""

In response, the Blankenship camp called the decision ""frightening,"" announcing that its attorneys would be evaluating next steps in the coming days. ""The Republican Party can now slander a candidate throughout the Primary, effectively denying that candidate an equal opportunity to win the nomination,"" the campaign wrote in a statement, adding, ""Americans desperately need to pay attention as the politicians continue to move voters to the sidelines and out of the election process.""

The case came at a tense time for the West Virginia Supreme Court, with one judge standing in for a suspended justice and two temporarily replacing judges forced out after lawmakers voted to impeach them.

Blankenship's last-ditch attempt had risked snagging votes from Republican nominee, State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in his race to replace Democratic incumbent Senator Joe Manchin. The attorney general's campaign celebrated the decision, issuing a brief statement: ""No more distractions to hide lying liberal Joe Manchin's record of supporting pro-abortion policies, gun control, and Hillary Clinton's campaign against coal miners.""

Sen. Joe Manchin has outperformed Morrisey in both polling and fundraising, despite President Trump's double digit win in the heavily Republican state of West Virginia during the 2016 presidential cycle. Manchin's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

On August 20, 2018, Breitbart News reported Hoggâ€™s eagerness for the Democrat Party to clear the way for him and the younger generation of gun controllers to take over. NYMag.com quoted Hoggâ€™s reference to Pelosi as â€œoldâ€ and his suggestion that it was time for her and her generation of Democrats to â€œmove the f**k off the plate and let [them] take control.â€

On August 21, 2018, Hogg began facing backlash for seizing on Pelosiâ€™s age:

Dear @davidhogg111, I sincerely appreciate all the work that you do especially registering folks to vote in this critical midterm election. I however would very much appreciate you leaving ageism out of politics it has no place there. We need all voices young &amp; senior. Best- Maya â€” Maya Contreras (@mayatcontreras) August 21, 2018

Another Twitter user responded to Hoggâ€™s comments by tweeting, â€œDonâ€™t be this guy, David Hogg. You can make this point without being sexist, homie.â€

In addition to the label of â€œsexist,â€ The Daily Wire reports that some of Hoggâ€™s followers have described his comments as â€œarrogant.â€

On August 21, Hogg tried to calm the backlash by tweeting:

I said â€œPelosi is old.â€ Trump is old. Hatch is old. Ted Cruz and Beto Oâ€™Rourke are both in the younger side of American leadership. We can go younger. Dems need to allow young people to seize leadership opportunities like the republicans have with people like Rubio, Ryan etc.

But Twitter follower Janet Johnson responded, â€œSorry Davidâ€¦. Iâ€™ll take a 975 year old Pelosi over 18 year old Ryan and Rubio. Youâ€™re doing great work but ageism isnâ€™t ok. Nancy Pelosi has fought and accomplished more than Ryan and Rubioâ€¦ combined. We should honor her, not denigrate her. This is very disappointing.â€

3MNJFORX8CM7QMZYO2FZK4WBLPU5FV,"Gay, Native American Democrat busts candidate mold in Kansas","TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) â€” Democrat Sharice Davids of Kansas added her name Wednesday to her partyâ€™s increasingly diverse slate of candidates advancing to the November ballot.

Davids, who would be the first gay, Native American elected to Congress, narrowly won a six-way primary in her eastern Kansas district, shattering the mold for a congressional primary winner in conservative Kansas and embodying the range of ethnicities and sexual orientations of Democratic candidates running throughout the country this fall.

Notably, the 38-year-old lawyer and activist from Kansas City, Kansas, is among a wave of gay, bisexual and transgender candidates running â€” the vast majority as Democrats â€” including at the top of the ballot in key states.

â€œVoters in the third congressional district have sent a clear message to the nation: Fairness and tolerance are Kansas values,â€ said Tom Witt, executive director of Equality Kansas, a LGBT advocacy organization.

Roughly 200 LGBT candidates are expected to be on the November ballot across the country for state and federal office, the most ever, according to Sean Meloy, senior political director of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, a non-partisan political advocacy group. They include national figures such as Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the nationâ€™s first openly gay member of the U.S. Senate, as well as Arizona Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema, who is bisexual, and Jared Polis of Colorado, who could become the first openly gay man elected governor in the U.S.

Davids also is a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, a Native American tribe in Wisconsin, but is not alone among Native American women running for prominent political office this year.

Democrat Deb Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo Tribe, won the June primary for New Mexicoâ€™s 1st Congressional District, a Democratic-leaning district that includes the Albuquerque area.

Thereâ€™s also Democrat Paulette Jordan of Idaho. A member of the Couer dâ€™Alene Tribe, Jordan won the June primary for Idaho governor, but faces an uphill battle in the Republican-heavy state to become the first Native American governor.

In Michigan on Tuesday, state Rep. Rashida Tlaib won the Democratic primary in the stateâ€™s 13th Congressional District. With no Republican opponent on the November ballot, sheâ€™s poised to become the nationâ€™s first Muslim woman elected to Congress.

In Kansas, Davids will face four-term Republican Kevin Yoder in the 3rd Congressional District, a Republican-leaning swath of urban and suburban eastern Kansas.

In their effort to claim seats in competitive districts now represented by Republicans, Democrats are targeting Yoderâ€™s, where Democrat Hillary Clinton narrowly won in 2016 while losing the state overall to Republican Donald Trump. Democrats must gain 23 seats to claim the House majority.

Davids was overshadowed nationally by labor lawyer Brent Welder, whom Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed and campaigned for last month. Preliminary totals showed Davids edging Welder in the crowded field by 2,088 votes out of 61,321 cast.

â€œWe were excited to talk with her, to fight for her, as others got national attention,â€ LGBTQ Victoryâ€™s Meloy said.

Though Davids represents a new generation of diverse candidates, the district sheâ€™s running to represent has little ethnic diversity. Johnson County, the districtâ€™s most populous, is 87 percent white.

Davids is a Cornell University law school graduate who worked as a lawyer for an Indian reservation in South Dakota before working as a White House fellow during Barack Obamaâ€™s presidency.

She also is a mixed martial arts fighter who introduced herself to voters with a video showing her in the ring, landing solid kicks to a large punching bag.

â€œYou told me you needed someone who lives your struggles,â€ she wrote in an early Wednesday fundraising email to supporters that began with, â€œWe did it!â€

Davids was backed by abortion-rights advocacy group EMILYâ€™s List, has called for treating gun violence as a public health crisis and has criticized tax cuts enacted by Trump.

The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, quickly tagged Davids as an â€œextremeâ€ liberal and predicted she would vote in lockstep with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.

3UEDKCTP9W8XTC5VD6LTY12CK0EK7H,Will DeVos let schools use federal funds to buy guns? Hereâ€™s the best response to that idea.,"

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos arrives to take part in a Federal Commission on School Safety meeting at the White House on Aug. 16. (Leah Millis/Reuters) (LEAH MILLIS/Reuters)

So now we hear that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and her administration have actually considered allowing public schools to use federal funds to purchase guns.

(This is, not so incidentally, the same Betsy DeVos who is the head of a federal commission on school security that is refusing to discuss gun control as a possible recommendation for stopping violence at schools.)

Exactly how serious a proposal this has been at the department is unclear, but a department official told The Washington Post that the idea originally came in requests from outside the department. (The New York Times first reported the story.) Education entities â€” either at the district or state level â€” were, apparently, asking permission to use funds from Title IV, otherwise known as Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants, to purchase guns.

If that is the case, then DeVos didnâ€™t originate the idea and may not even like it. But she has long been a supporter of state and local rights, so there is an open question about how comfortable she would be in telling these districts they couldnâ€™t without a federal law or regulation against it.

In any case, thereâ€™s been a lot of reaction from the political and education world about the idea, most of it beyond negative. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the second-largest teachers union in the country, said in a statement:

Betsy DeVos wants to turn schools into armed fortresses and make kids and educators less safe. Betsy DeVos wants to turn the U.S. government into an arms dealer for schools. Thatâ€™s insane.

But from the hundreds and now probably thousands of comments on news articles, here is one that sums it all up, from a teacher. This was a comment on The Postâ€™s story from a reader named Lynn Maxwell:

I am a teacher. I canâ€™t imagine that during the chaos of a school shooting that any teacher could leave a classroom and commence firing at a possible shooter. The logistics of training, storing weapons and splitting a teacherâ€™s attention away from the classroom is ludicrous in both concept and execution (pun intended). If a school district is going to protect a campus, dedicated campus police need to be hired whose sole job is to deal with issues such as this and who are highly trained in shoot/donâ€™t shoot situations. No teacher is in a position to split their attention to be a part time cop. The idea of using Title IV federal funds to pay for this is pretty silly considering that schools can hardly fund their programs and buildings currently. District budgets should be set up cover school safety issues as part of the school infrastructure. Like many teachers, I have put in many hundreds of $$$ into my art programs over the years because no school I ever have worked in has had remotely enough funds to undergird the curriculum that the states demand we teach; adding firearms for individual teachers just is not a viable solution and draws funds away from already underfunded programs. If we want to fix the shooting problems in schools we need to change peopleâ€™s attitudes, quit being divided as a country over political concerns and work together as a nation to solve the underlying social problems that produce school shooters. The cultural and social failures that produce school shooters are NOT a simplistic problem, nor are there facile solutions that are going to solve these problems.

That sums it up quite nicely, doesnâ€™t it? And here are other apt reactions from readers of The Post story:

This from a commenter named Jane S:

1 hour ago Education or safety is not going to improve unless we invest into our teachers. No curriculum change, technology, or guns are going to change that. We need to pay teachers more AND give them more (much more) prep time. And think about it, do you really want a sleep-deprived, overworked, by parents insulted teacher carry a gun? But thatâ€™s not going to happen. We live in America and people here do not like to pay taxes for the common good.

Scott's constituents were lined up outside the eatery when he dashed out a back door and ducked into an SUV before speeding away. They have been upset with the governor, as a red tide has been wreaking havoc on the state's waters, and many feel that Scott isn't doing enough to combat the crisis.

Supporters of the governor attempted to drown out the protesters, but they were hugely outnumbered.

Scott is in a tight race with Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for Nelson's seat in the U.S. Senate. The RealClearPolitics average shows Scott leading Nelson by 1.6 points, but Nelson was ahead in the most recent survey, the Rasmussen poll -- which, according to FiveThirtyEight, generally tends to favor Republicans.

The Florida governor has had a tough time leading a tumultuous state, especially after February's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland ignited a fire in the electorate.

Following that shooting, Scott -- who, according to The Washington Post, was previously a pro-gun governor with an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association -- signed a gun control bill that banned the sale of bump stocks and raised the age restriction for firearms purchasing from 18 to 21.

The red tide in Florida has been killing off local fish en masse, causing an unbearable stench that is pushing tourists away from beaches and infuriating residents. Scott declared a state of emergency in August, but tourists have been avoiding the state's west coast where the red tide is pouring in, according to the Sun Sentinel.",https://ijr.com/2018/09/1124627-rick-scott-booed-florida-red-tde/,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['2', '5', '1', '2', '4']"

December 30, 2016

Mitchell, a New York University graduate, quickly became a recognized name in the art world through his work in Cuba and his featured work on Instagram. His more than 40,000 Instagram followers include celebrities like Rose McGowan and Naomi Campbell.

The New York Times' ""Up Next"" series featured Mitchell in December.

""I depict black people and people of color in a really real and pure way,"" he told the Times. ""There is an honest gaze to my photos.""

The 23-year-old first gained attention in 2015 with his self-published book of photos,El Paquete, which focused on Cuban skate culture and architecture. Mitchell captured the book's 108 photos while in Cuba for six weeks as part of a documentary photography program, according to the Times.

Mitchell's work has appeared in other magazines, such as Teen Vogue's March for Our Lives feature. He photographed gun reform activist Nza-Ari Khepra with Parkland shooting survivors Emma Gonzalez, Sarah Chadwick and Jaclyn Corin for Teen Vogue's piece on the #NeverAgain gun control movement.

The 23-year-old has also shot covers for Fader and Office Magazine.

He has also directed film projects for clients such as Marc Jacobs and Ray-Ban. Mitchell told The New York Times in December that he was editing a three-screen film project he shot with a 35-millimeter camera on how race affects adolescents.

Mitchell's and Vogue's representatives did not immediately respond to HuffPost's request for comment.

A judge has temporary blocked online instructions for 3D printed guns. We need a permanent ban before tragedy strikes at the Capitol and elsewhere.

3D-printed plastic gun (Photo: USA TODAY via Department of Justice)

Itâ€™s difficult to imagine, but last Friday the federal government made it easier for anyone with internet access to download designs for creating a 3D-printed plastic firearm in their homes. This decision would allow individuals with dangerous histories to access online blueprints, evade state and federal gun laws and print an untraceable weapon without even obtaining a background check. Many of these downloadable guns would circumvent the federal law banning plastic guns and can be printed entirely in plastic.

As a former Chief of U.S. Capitol Police and Senate Sergeant at Arms, I know that a failure to permanently stop downloadable guns will increase the challenges of protecting the security of members of Congress, their staff and visitors to the Capitol.

To enter a building on the Capitol complex, visitors and staff must pass through a screening checkpoint run by Capitol Police. Any kind of deadly weapon â€” including guns â€” is prohibited in the complex to ensure that members can conduct their official business without the threat of violence from those who might wish to do them harm. Unfortunately, even the most technologically advanced security cannot neutralize all possible threats

Rising threat level from plastic guns

Last week, the Capitol community paused in a moment of silence to recognize the lives of Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut, who were killed by a deranged gunman in 1998. That shooting changed security at the Capitol forever, but it hasnâ€™t stopped the threats to members and visitors. Last month, we recognized the one-year mark of the congressional baseball practice shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, where members, staff, and friends were shot and injured. Two years ago, another individual brandished a BB gun in the Capitol Visitor Center full of tourists.

The Capitol Police is constantly re-evaluating the threats facing the Capitol and the people it protects. But itâ€™s difficult to imagine how much worse these threats would be if plastic firearms were readily available.

Would the Founders want our kids to die in school shootings like Santa Fe? I doubt it.

On guns, we're as paralyzed as I was the day my nephew was shot: Montana governor

Last weekend, because of special treatment from the State Department, a Texas company made downloadable instructions for 3D printing firearms readily available online. Anyone with access to a computer, an internet connection, and a capable 3D printer â€” including terrorists, felons, and others with dangerous histories â€” was able to make a variety of untraceable handguns, rifles, and assault weapons.

This type of capability increases the challenges for law enforcement, especially at the Capitol. We already have a wealth of intelligence that shows terrorists want to inflict at least symbolic damage to the Capitol because it represents freedom and American democracy. Just last year, an Islamic State propaganda magazine stressed the use of easily available guns in the U.S. to commit terrorist acts. With widely available downloadable instructions, the ingenuity of potential offenders who wish to do harm at the Capitol will challenge the technology of detection and defense, even in a secure facility protected by Capitol Police.

3D guns are a unique threat to our leaders

While I strongly support the Second Amendment and appreciate the fundamental right of American citizens to keep and bear arms, our elected leaders must recognize the unique threat downloadable firearms pose to public safety. Protecting visitors, staff, and members in the Capitol from harm is an obligation not just for Capitol Police, but it is a responsibility for all of our elected officials.

On Tuesday night, a federal court in Washington State issued a nationwide order that temporarily stopped the companyâ€™s publication of the blueprints online. But this injunction only lasts until Aug. 10. We can sit by and wait for Aug. 11 to end up in the same place as we were before the courts rightfully stepped in. Or, our leaders can permanently stop downloadable guns before tragedy strikes.

President Trumpâ€™s State Department must reverse the temporary modification to the United States Munitions List and withdraw the special exemption granted to the company immediately. And as the State Department finalizes a proposed rule about exporting guns that have already been built by manufacturers, it must keep gun schematics on the U.S. Munitions List and continue prohibiting the posting of these blueprints online.

Congress does not need to wait for the State Department and should pass legislation that will stop downloadable guns from being available online. Protecting the Capitol is not a partisan issue and I urge all members to support common sense proposals that will keep us safe.

Inaction on this important issue of public safety and national security is unacceptable.

So we're getting more of Walker's typical 'don't ask me! I know nothing' behavior. Thought he still has nothing to say about the Trump's-Putin FUBAR bear-hug in Helsinki, he has broken his silence about how he managed to get his picture taken with an alleged Russian spy who seemed enamored of his 2015 Presidential bid and who herself has managed to get herself charged by the US government for operating in the country as an unregistered foreign agent. Walker finally said he remembered meeting the woman at an NRA convention back when he was polling strongly prior to the Iowa caucuses only because other people have pointed it out now, that he doesn't remember speaking Russian to her (as she does), and doesn't know anyone who's been contacted by the authorities in the matter, the Journal Sentinel reports. Walker might as well say he thought he was at a National Russian Convention, looking for a pen pal. His denials and disinterest are a variation on his frequent absence of an opinion, whether it be about immigrant kids being snatched from their parents at the southern border, or on, say, evolution. Frankly, a lot gets past Walker.

Julie Dermansky at Bayou Brief of Louisiana writesâ€”Baptism by Fire: A Controversial Chemical Plant in the Center of Cancer Alley:

What should be done about a chemical plant in Louisianaâ€™s St. John the Baptist Parish that releases chloroprene â€” a chemical so toxic that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined nearby residents face the highest risk in the country of developing cancer from air pollution? The answer is simple, according to Retired Lt. Gen. Russel HonorÃ©: â€œFix it, move it, or shut it down.â€ HonorÃ© is the founder of the Green Army, a coalition of environmental groups and concerned citizens fighting against pollution in their communities. But local, state, and federal regulators havenâ€™t resolved issues swirling around emissions released by the Denka Performance Elastomer plant, located in LaPlace, Louisiana. The plant is next to the Mississippi River, on a stretch of land between New Orleans and Baton Rouge known as Cancer Alley. DuPontâ€™s synthetic rubber plant in LaPlace emitted chloroprene for 46 years before it was sold to Denka. Shortly after Denka took over the plant, the EPA reclassified chloroprene in 2010 as a likely human carcinogen. The EPA deems 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter as the acceptable standard for chloroprene emissions, a level that the plant overshoots considerably. [...]

Pete Talbot at The Montana Post writesâ€”Montana Democratic Party platform convention:

I hesitate to write this post. No matter how I phrase it, some friends in the party wonâ€™t be happy â€” depending on where they stand on the issues. The last thing I want to do is give the Democratic Party a black eye with this most crucial midterm election 112 days out. In a way, the convention is a snapshot of how democracy works: itâ€™s messy, and there are winners and losers. I continue to respect the delegates from all over Montana who gave up a summer weekend to sit in the Great Falls Civic Center. I have yet to see any media coverage of the convention. In the old days, Lee newspapers would have sent Chuck Johnson or Mike Dennison to the event, and the Great Falls Tribune would have had a reporter there. The only recap Iâ€™ve seen is on social media and there tends to be bias. So, hereâ€™s my view as a progressive participant. I should mention at the outset that Iâ€™m the director of the Montana Progressive Democrats (MtPD). We had five planks we wanted to add to the platform. A thumbnail sketch of the convention can be viewed by how those planks fared. Energy. Right out of the gate, I got my ass handed to me. This is the MtPD plank I introduced: We support an immediate and just transition to 100 percent renewable energy, and to take action to accelerate the shift to a clean energy economy that works for all. There must be a rapid phase out of fossil fuel projects in Montana to be replaced by alternative and sustainable union energy jobs. Iâ€™d just arrived in the Electric City from a gorgeous drive along the Blackfoot River and over Rogers Pass and onto the rolling plains of Central Montana. Organized labor was waiting for me. It based its opposition to the plank on a loss of good-paying union jobs in the fossil fuel industry and election defeats in energy producing counties. [...]

Vern Nelson at the Orange Juice Blog of California writesâ€”Trumpâ€™s Little Sister: At 99% agreement, thereâ€™s no daylight between Mimi and Donald:

Mimi Walters: â€œIt is very important that Republicans back the president, Heâ€™s the president of our party. He stands for what we stand for.â€œ Wow. 99%. Voting with our Mad King THAT dependably. Not even our Royce, Rohrabacher and Issa are that slavishly, unquestioningly obedient to all Trumpâ€™s authoritarian whims. 99% is true devotion, makes you wonder what that little 1% demurral was. But I guess the 45th District shouldnâ€™t be surprised, if theyâ€™ve really been following the Republican politician Mimi Walters throughout her career, as this blog has. [...] Why would she be offended at the Presidentâ€™s racist anti-Muslim ban? One of our earliest stories about Mimi covered her racist 2008 campaign against Harry Sidhu, exaggerating the Indian-Americanâ€™s â€œothernessâ€ by carefully darkening his skin on all her flyers â€“ and it WORKED! Got her into the State Senate. Why would she mind all of the Presidentâ€™s daily, hourly LYING? Donâ€™t forget that Mimi wouldnâ€™t be where she is right now, representing the good people of the 45th district in Congress, if she hadnâ€™t lied through her teeth about where she lived during her 2012 state Senate race â€“ faking a residence in a small Irvine apartment while never leaving her and her husbandâ€™s plush Laguna Niguel mansion (where she STILL lives, outside of the district she represents.) Her opponent Steve Young left flowers on â€œher Irvine doorstep,â€ and returned week after week to photograph her FADING FLOWERS.

A staffer at Colorado Pols writesâ€”Report: BLM HQ Will Move West:

As Erin Prater writes for the Colorado Springs Gazette: U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is prepared to move ahead on moving the Bureau of Land Management headquarters to the West, according to reports. [...] â€¦Rep. Scott Tiptonâ€™s office said Thursday that the department will conduct an analysis to help choose a location in the next six to eight months, Interior Department senior adviser Susan Combs told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, according to the release Thursday. â€œNinety-nine percent of the land that the BLM manages is located in the West, and the decisions made by the Bureau have daily impacts on those who live there, so it only makes sense to move the headquarters to a Western state. This would ensure that decisions would be made by those who understand the land best, resulting in more effective land management programs and policies. Moving the headquarters of the BLM to the American West has been a long-running project that has the support of Coloradoâ€™s entire Congressional delegation, as well as the backing of local officials and Gov. John Hickenlooper. Colorado isnâ€™t guaranteed to be the new home of the BLM, but Grand Junction is at least among the frontrunners. Itâ€™s too soon to tell if this pending move will have a significant effect on BLM policies in the West or is more of a publicity stunt, though a new HQ would almost certainly create some new jobs in Colorado.

In case you had any doubts, the Texas GOP party platform is still garbage. Texas Republicans approved multiple legislative priorities and backed a platform that includes more than 300 planks during their convention in June. As per usual, the platform is full of racist, xenophobic, sexist, transphobic and homophobic priorities. To save you the trouble (and horror) of going through 300+ planks of pure evil, weâ€™ve narrowed it down to the worst garbage we found in their agenda. [...] 1.

The Texas GOP: proclaims that â€” despite a 2015 Supreme Court ruling declaring the fundamental right to marry â€” marriage should only be between a man and woman, and that same-sex marriages need not be legally recognized,

claims the right to discriminate in the name of â€œreligious freedom,â€ saying they oppose â€œany criminal or civil penalties against those who oppose homosexuality out of faith, conviction, or belief in traditional values,â€

opposes â€œall efforts to validate transgender identityâ€ and seeks to ban transgender people from using restrooms that match their gender identity,

Iowa candidates seeking to use campaign funds to cover child care expenses are out of luck unless the state legislature and governor expressly allow the practice. The Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board voted 5-1 at a July 13 meeting for an opinion stating, â€œWe do not believe Iowa law clearly allows campaign funds to be used for a candidateâ€™s childcare expenses related [to] campaigning. We believe this issue is a policy decision best left to the legislature.â€ The Federal Election Commission determined in May that Congressional candidates â€œmay use campaign fundsâ€ to pay for child care expenses that â€œwould not exist irrespectiveâ€ of the campaign. Soon after, state House candidate Reyma McCoy McDeid, a single mother of a three-year-old, requested an advisory opinion on the matter from Iowaâ€™s campaign regulator. Iowa Code 68A.302 states that candidates and their committees â€œshall not use campaign funds for personal expenses or personal benefit.â€ The law allows â€œpayment for personal services directly related to campaign activitiesâ€ but does not mention child care. The FECâ€™s decision was unanimous, so I was surprised most Iowa ethics board members reached the opposite conclusion. [...] [Here is the boardâ€™s advisory opinion.]

Regina Willis at Better Georgia writesâ€”END THE LIES: the fight against fake womenâ€™s health centers in Gwinnett County:

Fake womenâ€™s health clinics peddle lies and shame to pregnant folks seeking more information about their reproductive healthcare options. Calling themselves â€œcrisis pregnancy centers,â€ pregnant folks believe they are going to a licensed healthcare facility to get medically accurate information about their pregnancy and pregnancy options. Unfortunately, they only get lies, shame and stigma from untrained volunteers. This past weekend, half a dozen Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) swept through Gwinnett County to speak with residents about the impacts of fake womenâ€™s health clinics. Led by NAPAWF-Atlanta (the Atlanta Chapter of the National Asian Pacific American Womenâ€™s Forum), volunteers learned about canvassing and then put those skills to use, speaking with about 100 Gwinnett residents. â€œThis is alarming to anyone who hears about it, which was abundantly clear in our conversations with residents on Saturday,â€ said Roula AbiSamra, the Georgia organizer for NAPAWF. â€œGwinnettians of all backgrounds disapprove of these deceptive tactics, and are concerned about real access to legitimate reproductive health services and information.â€ [...] Pregnant women seeking information about their full range of reproductive health care options â€” including information about carrying a pregnancy to term, birth control or abortion â€” walk out of these centers being told the wrong gestational age of their fetus, given medically inaccurate information about fetal development, and offered only prayers, shame and lies when trying to learn more about abortion. At the Georgia State Capitol, women have even told lawmakers stories of having serious health conditions that affect their health or the health of their fetus go undiagnosed and unrecognized because these fake womenâ€™s clinics are not licensed medical facilities and do not have trained medical staff. They ONLY exist to shame people who are thinking about getting an abortion, at any cost. [...]

Patrick McHugh at The Progressive Pulse of North Carolina writesâ€”Party like its 1929. Income inequality rivals era before the Great Depression:

Before you dig out your flapper dresses and suspenders, the odds are this is a party you canâ€™t afford to attend. A new report from the Economic Policy Institute shows that the level of income inequality in the United States and North Carolina has increased over the past several years to a point where we are now at or above the economic divide that helped to propel the world in the worst economic collapse in modern history. â€œThere has been vast and widespread growth in income inequality in every corner of the country. Overall, the growth in incomes of the bottom 99 percent has improved since our last report, in step with a strengthening economy, but the gap between the top 1 percent and everyone else still grew in the majority of states we examine here.â€ In North Carolina, the average income for someone in the top one percent is 20.6 times larger than everyone else, a figure that has increased substantially during the Great Recession and is much higher than it was in the 1960s through early 1980s. The top one percent took home over 17 percent of all income in North Carolina in 2015, and the top 0.1 percent commanded 7.4 of all income. In 1974, when the level of income inequality in North Carolina was the lowest in modern history, the top one percent only consumed 7.8 percent of all North Carolina income. Weâ€™re not doomed to repeat the Great Depression, but it is clear that state and federal policy in the last several years has failed to address the single most pressing economic challenge of our time. Instead of hoping that more tax cuts for wealthy people and profitable corporations will magically fix our problems, itâ€™s time for leaders in Raleigh and Washington, D.C., to admit that we are reaching levels of inequality that threaten the social and economic fabric of our country.

3HUR21WDDV7MSW03ZYQI18UBK82YXL,Journalism Will Get Its Mojo Back,"Its problems -- from shuttered newspapers to Big Tech -- are many, but the demand for information is still great.

The news that Marc Benioff, the founder and co-CEO of Salesforce.com, and his wife Lynne are buying Time magazine is paradoxical. On one hand, the internet revolution, of which Salesforce is a part, has badly mauled the media. Yet on the other hand, tech tycoons seem increasingly willing to invest heavily to revive at least some media titles.

We all know about the wipeout in journalism over the past couple of decades. And while some conservatives might cheer the defunding of the mostly liberal mainstream media, others on the Right, including here at TAC, have pointed to the greater danger of devitalizing our civic discourse.

So perhaps in these new purchases -- which also include Amazon's Jeff Bezos buying The Washington Post and Apple's Laurene Powell Jobs buying The Atlantic -- we can see a sort of cosmic equalization. That is, it's a kind of media homeostasis in which the downward trend is bent upward, as the public's interest in journalism is met in a new way. In his 1841 essay ""Compensation,"" Ralph Waldo Emerson observed that things have a way of evening out. As he put it, ""Dualism underlies the nature and condition of man. ...Every sweet hath its sour; every evil its good.""

Or perhaps we're simply seeing the teched-up revival of a familiar archetype: the Press Lord. These days, journalistic properties might be dog investments, but these days, too, some Americans are so rich that they don't care -- they can afford a whole media kennel.

Or, to put it another way, if you're rich enough to be at the pinnacle of the Maslowian pyramid, owning media titles, even money losers, might be an excellent form of self-actualization.

Moreover, if a plutocrat has political ambitions, then media muscle starts to look less like an ego ornament and more like an actual investment. The most famous such figure in U.S. history is William Randolph Hearst, who used his newspapers as a platform to get himself elected to Congress, and further sought, albeit unsuccessfully, the mayorship of New York City and the governorship of New York State. Why, he even had presidential aspirations, and was a would-be White House kingmaker until the end of his life.

Today, another New Yorker, Michael Bloomberg, seems to have some of those same ambitions. The financial data company he founded has given him a net worth estimated at $52.9 billion. Yet he clearly yearns for more than just money: he was mayor of New York City for 12 years and has given billions to various causes, including gun control and fighting climate change. And, oh yes, he's thinking once again of running for president, this time as a Democrat.

In the meantime, he has turned the once-utilitarian Bloomberg terminal into a media jukebox, providing news on myriad subjects far from Wall Street. Not long ago, he bought a well-known but faded title Businessweek -- and voila! It's now Bloomberg Businessweek. And of course, everyone knows that if The New York Times were ever up for sale, Bloomberg would buy it, at virtually any markup, in a New York minute.

For his part, Donald Trump -- the man liberals love to hate -- is also aiding, inadvertently, the journalistic uptick. On September 17, The Washington Post headlined a story, ""A Trump effect at journalism schools? Colleges see a surge in admissions."" As the article detailed, enrollment in many journalism schools -- including at Northwestern, Syracuse, the University of Maryland, and Arizona State -- is up sharply. Needless to say, many of these aspiring Woodwards are motivated by their desire to join the anti-Trump #Resistance. Also needless to say, many foundations have been eager to help, eagerly opening their checkbooks to mostly liberal programs and professors.

Now of course, not every journalism student goes on to graduate, and not all of them will find jobs. After all, the number of billionaires eager to burn through at least some of their fortune on the media is limited, and Trump the motivating tool won't be around forever.

However, it's also true that there is a natural instinct for news -- that's the media homeostasis. People want to know what's going on, including in their immediate environment. And so if local radio, for example, has been hollowed out, well, there's always NPR, eager to accept donations from non-billionaires -- and even non-millionaires.

Moreover, many others, too, are getting into the game of producing news. It's been estimated, for instance, that public relations professionals outnumber journalists by a six-to-one ratio. And while nobody should mistake a flack for a journalist, PR vehicles have had a way of morphing over time into news operations. Indeed, many, if not most, august media institutions had their origins in the simple desire to sell advertising.

In addition, governments, corporations, trade associations, and activist groups have built increasingly active media presences, refracting the news through the prisms of their isms. For Second Amendment fans, for instance, what better place to get news about guns -- and many other topics -- than from NRA-TV? Indeed, given the ubiquity of cellphone cameras, just about anyone can hope to be a journalist, even if only for the proverbial 15 minutes.

It's also true that sometimes supply creates its own demand. That is, if there are enough clever reportorial wannabes running around, they'll find new ways to make journalism pay. Once again, with an Emersonian circularity, the same digital forces that destroyed much of the media are helping to build it back up, as apps aplenty help finance the next crop of crusaders.

Of course, looming over all of journalism is Facebook, along with the other tech giants, including Google and Twitter. These social media companies, of course, have swallowed up most of the revenue that once went to old-line media.

Yet today, for all their power and profitability, the techsters find themselves in a nasty political crossfire. Liberals believe that Silicon Valley allowed Hillary Clinton to be hurt in the 2016 election, and conservatives believe the tech giants are actively out to hurt them in 2018.

The accusers on both sides could be substantially correct, and that's why it seems inevitable that significant regulation at the federal level is coming. And if that regulation comes in the form of ""rules of the road"" -- that is, legal requirements for political fairness, including perhaps transparency over their fabled algorithms -- then the tech companies will be on their way to something akin to utility status. To be sure, they'll still be plenty rich and powerful; they'll just have to behave themselves better in the eyes of the nation.

Like it or not, someday Facebook could start to resemble the old broadcast networks, under the watchful eye of the Federal Communications Commission, or maybe even a bit like the old Ma Bell. (Emerson would surely savor that sort of eternal return.)

In such a regulated environment, the monetary wellsprings of journalism will be replenished. Why? Because in a pluralistic society in which predatory and near-monopolistic power has been restrained, all the familiar players, including the new press lords, will continue to see the value of having their voices heard.

And so, as journalists and the journalism biz regain their balance after the tech onslaught of the past two decades, they'll find a way to get their mojo back. In fact, as we are seeing, they're already finding it.

3UAU495MIJAIHE26O66XFAX5CGMOU8,Russian woman who tried to broker Trump-Putin meetings is busted for,"WASHINGTON - A Russian woman who tried to broker secret meetings between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin during the 2016 presidential campaign has been arrested for espionage, the US Justice Department announced.

Hours after President Trump met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and said there's no reason Russia would have meddled in the US election, the Justice Department announced the arrest of 29-year-old Russian national Maria Butina and charged her with spying in the US.

The agency said Butina, 29, who lives in Washington, D.C., acted as an agent inside the U.S. ""by developing relationships with U.S. persons and infiltrating organizations having influence in American politics, for the purpose of advancing the interests of the Russian Federation.""

She undertook such activities without disclosing to the U.S. government that she was working for Russia, which is required by law.

Butina attempted to organize a pair of meetings between Putin and Trump during the campaign, according to the New York Times.

According to a court affidavit, from as early as 2015 and continuing through at least February 2017, Butina worked at the direction of a high-level official in the Russian government who was previously a member of the legislature of the Russian Federation and later became a top official at the Russian Central Bank.

Butina was involved with a Russian gun group that the National Rifle Association supported, according to CNN.",https://nypost.com/2018/07/16/russian-woman-who-tried-to-broker-trump-putin-meetings-is-busted-for-spying/,"['Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic']","['1', '3', '2', '1', '1']"

The Latest on the meeting earlier this week between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump (all times local):

11:45 a.m.

The Russian government is pushing for the release of a gun rights activist accused of being a covert agent in the U.S., calling her arrest a ""farce.""

The Russian ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, told a conference in Moscow that the accusations against Maria Butina are groundless and that American authorities tried to ""break her"" and refused her consular visits for the first few days after her arrest.

Russian Embassy representatives visited Butina in Washington on Thursday, and said in a statement that she is in good health but ""has difficulties in adapting to prison conditions.""

Antonov said Moscow is working to return her to Russia. The Russian Foreign Ministry started an online campaign to ""Free Maria Butina.""

U.S. federal prosecutors accused Butina this week of being a covert Russian agent and working to infiltrate U.S. political organizations, including the National Rifle Association, before and after Donald Trump's election as president.

Butina, 29, denies wrongdoing.

___

11:30 a.m.

Russia's ambassador to the United States says that Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed a possible referendum in eastern Ukraine.

Anatoly Antonov told a conference in Moscow that ""this issue was discussed"" and that Putin made ""concrete proposals"" to Trump on finding solutions to the Ukraine conflict. Antonov would not give further details of what was discussed at the Helsinki summit about Ukraine.

Trump tweeted that the two men discussed Ukraine but has not mentioned a referendum or revealed specifics of the Ukraine discussions.

The U.S. and Russia have been on opposing sides of the conflict in Ukraine, unleashed after a popular uprising against a pro-Russian president and Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Ukraine and European powers are unlikely to support a referendum in the Donbass region, where pro-Russian separatists hold sway.

11:15 a.m.

Russia's ambassador to the U.S. says Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump should continue to have direct contact after their summit this week.

Speaking Friday in Moscow, Anatoly Antonov did not directly respond to Trump's proposal to invite Putin to Washington later this year.

He called Monday's summit in Helsinki a ""key event"" in international politics and laughed off suggestions that the two men made any ""secret deals.""

Concerns have been raised in the U.S. about what the two presidents discussed at their meeting. Limited details have emerged, but Antonov said discussions included ways to cooperate on arms control and Iran's nuclear activities. He said Russian diplomats will work with American counterparts to ""fulfill the agreements reached.""

WASHINGTON â€“ The Trump administration will no longer force some tax-exempt organizations, including politically active groups such as the National Rifle Association, to identify their contributors to federal tax officials.

The policy, announced this week by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, achieves a long-standing goal of some conservative groups who say donor disclosure, even to the IRS, could subject their contributors to government intimidation and harassment.

The change drew protests Tuesday from campaign finance watchdogs, who said it strips the government of its ability to scrutinize those donations and could lead to foreign interests illegally infiltrating U.S. elections through advocacy groups â€“ as the country grapples with Russian interference in the 2016 presidential contest.

""This is the theater of the absurd,"" said Fred Wertheimer of the watchdog group Democracy 21. ""By limiting donor disclosure to the IRS, they have limited any ability to prevent Russia and Russian oligarchs to launder unlimited, undisclosed and illegal contributions through advocacy groups into federal elections.""

It also set up an immediate campaign finance battle on Capitol Hill as the midterm congressional elections heat up.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., celebrated the administration's move from the Senate floor, saying it bars the government from improperly using its power to ""invite harassment of citizens"" by ""angry left-wing activists.""

The top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, said he would oppose Trump's nominee to run the IRS, California tax lawyer Charles Rettig, unless the administration revoked the new policy.

""It's the latest attempt by Secretary Mnuchin and Donald Trump to eliminate transparency and keep officials and lawmakers from following the money,"" Wyden said.

The change will affect labor unions, social clubs, trade organizations and politically active advocacy groups, ranging from Planned Parenthood Action Fund to parts of the influential conservative network overseen by Kansas billionaire Charles Koch.

The names of donors to these nonprofit groups have not been publicly available, but the organizations were required to disclose contributor information to the IRS on their annual tax returns. These groups generally do not operate as charities, and their donors do not receive tax deductions in exchange for their contributions.

As a result, Mnuchin said the IRS doesn't need their donor information to police tax laws. The tax agency still can ask the organizations for details on contributors if additional scrutiny is warranted.

â€œAmericans shouldnâ€™t be required to send the IRS information that it doesnâ€™t need to effectively enforce our tax laws, and the IRS simply does not need tax returns with donor names and addresses to do its job in this area,â€ Mnuchin said in a statement.

More: Exclusive: Secret money funds more than 40 percent of outside congressional ads

Officials affiliated with Koch long have pushed for this change and lobbied on behalf of a bill that passed the House in 2016 that would have kept donors anonymous. The legislation was opposed by the Obama administration.

Tuesday, a top Koch official praised the Trump administration's move.

""The Treasury Department and IRS took a positive step toward protecting the First Amendment rights of Americans,"" Nathan Nascimento of the Koch's Freedom Partners said in a statement. ""This was the right decision because citizens shouldn't fear harassment or persecution over their beliefs.""

NRA officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Monday, federal authorities unsealed charges against a Russian national they accused of seeking to infiltrate American political organizations, including the NRA, on behalf of the Kremlin.

Supporters of the new policy noted that the IRS has faced controversy over its handling of tax-exempt groups. In 2013, for instance, the agency mistakenly released a portion of the Republican Governors Association tax return that disclosed some of its donors. That year, the tax agency became engulfed in scandal after the agency's inspector general found federal tax officials inappropriately targeted political groups for additional scrutiny.

3OPLMF3EU65XG3F0EDEJ9Y1H9HALNM,3-D plastic guns: How the political script has flipped on First Amendment,"Earlier this summer, when the United States Department of Justice quietly settled a long-standing free-speech lawsuit brought by the Texas coder Cody Wilson, many gun rights groups hailed the decision as the beginning of the end for gun control.

In an era of powerful 3D printing, digital technology has made it possible to construct virtually undetectable plastic guns that could be made relatively simply in the privacy of home. The result, say Mr. Wilson and others, could be an unstoppable ""disintermediating the State"" since such weapons are without manufacturer markings and serial numbers and can remain outside the reach of state bureaucracies and various restrictive gun laws.

Yet the prospect of such stealthy, 3D-printable ""ghost guns,"" as detractors call them, has laid bare yet another cultural challenge to the concept of freedom of speech and the free flow of information, many scholars say.

Recommended: As midterms approach, conservative 'Never Trumpers' find allies outside the lines

In some ways, the advent of printable guns has reversed certain political scripts. Democrats and many liberals are using old states rights arguments to push the need for law and order. By contrast, many conservative libertarians - some of whom, like Mr. Wilson, embrace aspects of the term ""anarchist"" - have championed classic liberal ideas of free speech: a robust, rough-and-ready free flow of information, competing in the marketplace of ideas.

""The real story is that this is not a cut and dried issue,"" says Aram Sinnreich, chairman of the Communication Studies division at American University in Washington. ""I care very personally, as a human being and as a citizen, I care very deeply about about gun control.""

""But I also care very deeply about free speech on the internet,"" he continues. ""And I'm torn on this subject. I don't know what the right answer is."" One thing is certain, he says: There are profound risks to regulating ideas.

QUESTION OF 'PRIOR RESTRAINT'

In 2013, Mr. Wilson successfully developed the digital blueprints for a simple one-shot plastic pistol he called the ""Liberator"" and posted them to his website. It didn't take long for the Obama administration to shut the site down, ruling that the information he was providing violated federal regulations.

But Wilson, and his attorneys, called this an illegal ""prior restraint"" of his First Amendment rights. And earlier this summer the Justice department agreed, paying most of his legal fees, his attorneys said, and settled the case.

""Not only is this a First Amendment victory for free speech, it also is a devastating blow to the gun prohibition lobby,"" said Alan Gottlieb, founder of Second Amendment Foundation, a Washington state based gun rights group that defended Wilson in court, in a statement.

The flipping of the script comes, Democrats say, amid the instant global reach of potentially dangerous information. Some even call for restrictions on certain forms of speech.

""As a result of the Department of State's settlement with [Wilson], terrorists, criminals, and individuals seeking to do harm would have unfettered access to print and manufacture dangerous firearms,"" wrote 21 states attorneys general, most from Democratic states, in a letter to the Trump administration on Monday. ""Some of these weapons may even be undetectable by magnetometers in places like airports and government buildings and untraceable by law enforcement.""

Among these, attorneys general in eight states filed a lawsuit challenging the settlement, and on Tuesday a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked Wilson from reposting the repository of an assortment of digital codes for 3D-printable plastic guns.

""It's not that I'm a nihilist about it,"" Wilson told The Washington Post in July. He said he knew the information he was providing could be used for radical purposes. But free speech remains a bedrock principle of liberty in the public domain, and the government cannot ""violate"" his coding or his ideas. His digital blueprints were ""equally everyone's and no one's,"" he said.

It's an idea that many political liberals have also long espoused.

""Should [Internet Service Providers] be policing every 1 and every 0 that travels along their networks and screen out 3D printed guns?"" Professor Sinnreich says. ""Well, that's essentially what ISPs do in China. But what they're screening out is words like democracy. So do we really want, at this point in our political development, to empower the internet infrastructure to make those discriminatory choices on our behalf?""

At the same time, many liberal critics have noted that freedom of speech arguments have become a conservative cudgel against the regulatory power of the state on a number of fronts.

This year the Supreme Court's conservatives used First Amendment freedom of speech arguments to ban compulsory union dues and reject a California law that required pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion. Religious liberty advocates and wedding vendors have begun to use freedom of speech principles to opt out of providing service for same-sex couples, arguing that their artistic expressions are protected forms of speech that may not be coerced.

In 2010, the high court's conservative majority used the First Amendment to throw out restrictions on unlimited campaign contributions by corporations and unions.

Justice Elena Kagan characterized this conservative use of free speech principles as a ""weaponizing of the First Amendment.""

""Speech is everywhere -- a part of every human activity (employment, health care, securities trading, you name it),"" she wrote in her dissent to the June decision that gutted long-established laws governing union dues. ""For that reason, almost all economic and regulatory policy affects or touches speech. So the majority's road runs long. And at every stop are black-robed rulers overriding citizens' choices.""

TECHNOLOGY OUTPACING THE LAW

Still, in the case of the kind of digital information providing the codes for 3D-printable plastic guns, a number of scholars believe existing laws and regulations can fit the free speech challenges posed.

""We've always distinguished between laws that deal with the distribution of information and laws that deal with what you do with that information,"" says Jonathan Adler, a law professor and director of the Center for Business Law and Regulation at at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Ohio.

""These 3D printers are kind of new, and any time we get a new technology, it's understandable that we, because of our lack of familiarity, we really don't think about how to actually get technologies into the legal categories we already have,"" he continues.

And courts have long accommodated the free flow of information - take ""The Anarchist Cookbook,"" still sold in retail outlets such as Amazon, which similarly contains information on preparing weapons and explosives at home, as well as various types of drugs.

Both liberal and conservative justices have used the First Amendment to protect images of animal cruelty, violent video games, and other disturbing content.

Federal court decisions, too, have long established that disseminating certain kinds of information, including digital code in general, is protected speech, notes Erica Goldberg, a First Amendment expert at the University of Dayton School of Law in Ohio. ""The sharing of computer code with others to communicate ideas or functionality is protected speech - although the actual printing of the gun can be criminalized,"" she says.

Indeed, many point out that federal laws such as the Undetectable Firearms Act still prohibits owning plastic guns, or any weapon designed to avoid detection. Wilson is only providing blueprints for guns that are already legal, advocates say.

""It's very easy to lose sight of the fact that again there are core values of political speech where we want to tolerate the broadest possible dissemination of ideas,"" says Saul Cornell, professor of American history at Fordham University in New York and the author of ""A Well-Regulated Militia: The Founding Fathers and the Origins of Gun Control in America."" But there are a lot of areas that are at a very minimum gray, and then there are some areas that actually there are competing values.""

Information about weapons of mass destruction or digital codes for military grade weapons would not be protected, Professor Cornell says. And child pornography is always prohibited.

But there remains the possibility that governments and ISPs may be able to do very little to stop such information. ""The enforcement problem for the government is that it is near impossible to go after individuals who print the gun code because they are diffuse and undetectable,"" says Professor Goldberg. ""So the state governments would rather be able to go after the organization or individual who is allowing everyone to access the code.""

Still, a court could rule that speech restrictions are permitted if they serve ""a compelling government interest,"" she says. ""Here, public safety might be a compelling enough interest to restrict speech, but this type of strict constitutional scrutiny is not often satisfied when speech is involved - in order to maintain our robust speech protections.""

Such free speech questions surrounding the digital blueprints for 3D-printable plastic guns are part of a discussion the nation has been having from the start, says Sinnreich: ""It's the same argument we've been having since the founding of this country, which is, do you privilege liberty over security, or security over liberty?""

""It's a question of calculating the net benefit for society,"" he continues. ""For everything that you gain in this fight, you lose something too. For every 3D printed gun that you stop or intercept, you're going to be impinging on the privacy and free speech of a million other people. So how do we make those calculations?""

â— Primary Day: The Blankenshiping: Tuesday brings us one of the most important primary nights of the year as voters go to the polls in Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia, and we've put together our guide of what's on tap.

We have closely watched GOP Senate primaries in Indiana and especially in West Virginia (oh hi, Don Blankenship!), and both parties have expensive contests for governor of Ohio. We also have plenty of House races to watch across these four states; one of the big contests to watch will be in North Carolina's 3rd District, where GOP Rep. Walter Jones could be the first member of Congress to lose renomination this cycle.

Things kick off at 6 PM ET when polls close in most of Indiana, with the small portion of the state in the Central time zone closing an hour later. Polls close in North Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia at 7:30 PM ET. We hope you'll join us at Daily Kos Elections on Tuesday for our liveblog of all of the races on the docket: You can also follow us on Twitter, where we'll be live-tweeting the results. And check out our calendar for a look at primary nights to come.

Senate

â— FL-Sen: Filing closed late last week for federal candidates for Florida's Aug. 28 primaries, and the state has a list of contenders here. Note that the deadline to file for state-level offices isn't until June 22, even though that primary will also be on Aug. 28. Note also that the deadline to run as a major-party candidate has now passed in 366 of the nation's 435 congressional districts.

The Sunshine State has an expensive Senate contest ahead between Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson and GOP Gov. Rick Scott, neither of whom face any serious primary opponents. Scott's campaign has already spent $5 million on positive ads in the month since he announced his bid, while a super PAC called New Republican has dropped another $2.4 million against Nelson. This race has been polled many times over the past year, and there's little agreement about which candidate has the advantage.

â— IN-Sen: The super PAC Hoosiers for Conservative Values, which is supporting Rep. Luke Messer in Tuesday's GOP primary, has launched a last-minute $350,000 ad buy against Rep. Todd Rokita and wealthy businessman Mike Braun.

â— MT-Sen: Air Force veteran Troy Downing's misdemeanor trial has been moved to late July, several weeks after the June GOP primary to take on Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. So â€¦ congrats?

Downing was charged last year with trying to buy hunting and fishing licenses as an out-of-state resident every year from 2011 to 2016, as well as of trying to transfer a license to another person and helping an unqualified applicant get a hunting license. Downing, who has residences in California and Montana, is arguing that he did indeed meet the residency requirements and has tried to get those charges dismissed.

â— TN-Sen: On behalf of the progressive group Health Care Voter, PPP is out with a survey giving Democrat Phil Bredesen a 46-43 edge over Republican Marsha Blackburn. This is the third Democratic poll released in the last month giving Bredesen the edge, while Mason-Dixon also found him ahead 46-43; Republicans haven't released any surveys since February.

â— WI-Sen: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin's latest ad touches on a very personal note to relate to struggling Wisconsinites. The minute-long segment features Baldwin speaking to the camera as she relays what it was like to grow up with a mother who struggled with drug abuse and mental illness for much of her life; Baldwin's mother died last August, and the senator only recently opened up about her story. Baldwin emphasizes that she understands just how devastating the opioid crisis is in Wisconsin and the country because of her own experiences with the fallout.

Gubernatorial

â— AK-Gov: On Friday, Gov. Bill Walker announced that he would compete in the August Democratic primary while remaining an independent.

Democratic leaders successfully sued to allow independents to run in party primaries, and it's not a surprise Walker is taking advantage of this new rule. Republicans usually have the edge in Alaska races, and it would be very tough for Walker, who was elected in 2014 with Democratic support, to win a general election with a Democratic nominee taking critical support from him. It would also probably be easier for Walker to win in November as the de facto Democratic candidate while still being listed on the ballot as an independent than as a full-fledged Democrat.

However, there's no guarantee Walker will be the de facto Democratic candidate. Former Sen. Mark Begich has spent months flirting with a bid, and he reaffirmed over the weekend that he's still considering. Begich almost certainly knows that he'd face very tough odds in the general election if he had to face both a Republican and Walker, and maybe he's hoping that if he defeated the governor in a primary, Walker would drop out rather than invite mutually-assured destruction. The filing deadline for the primary is June 1.

â— GA-Gov: Former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams' latest Democratic primary ad touts her record of accomplishments in office, arguing she fought to expand Medicaid, opposed tax hikes on working families, and boosted funding for public transportation projects. The ad asserts she'll work toward a more inclusive Georgia where everyone has opportunity.

â— ME-Gov: On behalf of FairVote, a group that advocates for instant-runoff voting, SurveyUSA gives us a rare look at Maine's June 12 primaries for governor, but there's a twist. This is the first statewide primary in American history that will be conducted through IRV, where voters will be allowed to rank their choices. If no on takes a majority of first-place votes, the last-place candidate gets eliminated and their voters' next choices get assigned to the remaining candidates, with the process continuing until one candidate wins a majority.

To simulate how this instant runoff might go down, SurveyUSA asked respondents to rank their choices, just as they'll get to on primary day. The poll begins by giving voters a list of candidates (as well as the option of saying they're undecided) and asking them to select their first choice. Afterwards, they're given the same list and asked to select their second choice. The process repeats until voters are asked to pick their last choice candidate: For Democrats, there are seven of these questions (one for each candidate), while the GOP has four.

On the Democratic side, 32 percent of respondents select Attorney General Janet Mills as their first choice, with undecided at 24. Former state House Speaker Mark Eves is at 16, while state Sen. Mark Dion and businessman Adam Cote take 10 and 9, respectively; no other candidate takes more than 5 percent. Mills ultimately takes a majority on the fifth round: The three candidates with little support are gradually eliminated before Cote is knocked out in round four; Mills then beats Eves 55-26, with Dion at 19

For the GOP, businessman Shawn Moody leads with 34 in round one, with undecided second with 22. Former state cabinet official Mary Mayhew takes 19, while state Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason and state House Minority Leader Ken Fredette take 15 and 10, respectively. Moody captures the majority in round three after Fredette and then Mason are eliminated, with Moody defeating Mayhew 65-35. Interestingly, in both primaries, the first-round leader is also the eventual winner.

However, this is the only recent poll of the raceâ€”and the only one that's tried to model an instant runoffâ€”so it's tough to know if Mills and Moody are as dominant as SurveyUSA finds them with a little more than a month to go before the primary. Candidates also have only just started advertising, so the state of play can certainly change.

â— NM-Gov: The National Education Association New Mexico chapter has endorsed Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham in the Democratic primary for governor.

House

â— AR-02: Talk Business and Hendrix College take a look at the May 22 Democratic primary to face GOP Rep. French Hill, and they give state Rep. Clarke Tucker a wide 41-11 lead over teacher Gwen Combs, with fellow teacher Paul Spencer at 10. Tucker has the support of the national Democratic establishment, and he's been a strong fundraiser so far. If no one takes a majority, there would be a runoff July 19.

â— CA-29: Late last week, Democratic Rep. Tony Cardenas confirmed that he's the target of a lawsuit alleging that he'd sexually assaulted a 16-year-old girl in 2007, though his attorney called the charges ""100%, categorically untrue."" (The suit had been filed anonymously, pursuant to California law, but identifying details that pointed to Cardenas prompted him to come forward.) On Saturday, Nancy Pelosi asked the House Ethics Committee to investigate the matter, though she cautioned that Cardenas had ""appropriately asked us to withhold judgement until there is a full investigation of the facts.""

According to the suit, Cardenas, a devoted golfer, first met the girl at a golf tournament in 2005. The two were playing a game of golf in 2007 when, she alleges, Cardenas gave the girl a cup of water that had a ""peculiar taste."" Some hours later, the girl collapsed and Cardenas drove her to the emergency room. The girl says that during the ride, Cardenas fondled her breasts and vagina.

The Los Angeles Times, which first reported the lawsuit, says that it ""has been unable to corroborate the allegations, and no public evidence has emerged to support them,"" and a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department says it ""has no active investigation into Cardenas."" Cardenas, a former Los Angeles city councilman, easily won election to California's 29th Congressional District after redistricting left it open in 2012. This dark blue seat in the northeast San Fernando Valley voted 78-17 for Hillary Clinton and is also majority Latino, at 68 percent.

â— CA-39: It's full steam ahead for the DCCC in California's 39th District: The committee, which last month placed Navy veteran Gil Cisneros on its Red to Blue list, will reportedly spend $294,000 on cable TV ads in the coming week. The effort is aimed at avoiding a disaster in next monthâ€™s top-two primary, much like a similar operation the D-Trip ran in the 24th District last cycle,

Then as now, Democrats were worried about getting locked out of the general election in an open-seat raceâ€”an outcome the NRCC did its best to foment. That race, however, pitted a pair of prominent Democrats against two credible Republicans, leading to Democrat Salud Carbajal (with the DCCC's help) advancing to and then winning the November general election against Republican Justin Fareed.

This time, the math is much dicier. Including Cisneros, who famously won $266 million in a 2010 lottery drawing, there are four serious Democratic candidates but only three legit-looking Republicans. In addition, there are fewer Democratic votes to go around in the 39th, which is historically red turf but swung toward Hillary Clinton last year, than in the 24th, which is considerably bluer.

As such, there's a substantial risk that two Republicans will advance to the November general election. Limited polling confirms this problem, showing a tightly packed field with no obvious front-runnersâ€”though there's a non-zero chance that two Democrats could make it past the primary. But the prospect of a lockout is a terrifying one for Team Blue, which explains the DCCC's decision to back a single horse, though it's bound to infuriate supporters of the other hopefuls.

It's also not without risk. Last week, a state Assembly candidate named Melissa Fazli accused Cisneros of behaving inappropriately toward her, claiming he'd invited her to his room after hours at the California Democratic Party convention in February, then later insinuated he wanted to have sex with her in exchange for a donation to her campaign. Cisneros called the accusations ""a falsehood"" and charged that Fazli was a ""surrogate"" for rival Andy Thorburn, which she denied.

Thorburn and the two other main Democrats, Mai Khan Tran and Sam Jammal, issued an unusual joint statement saying that Fazli's charges ""cannot be ignored,"" but in fact, they largely have been: So far, not a single traditional media outlet has covered the story. In the #MeToo era, when similar accusations against other politicians have almost always earned some attention, the fact that Fazli's story has not gotten any play stands out, and that absence of coverage may have helped make the DCCC comfortable in moving forward here.

â— FL-05: The Democratic primary for this safely blue North Florida seat is a duel between freshman Rep. Al Lawson, and former Jacksonville Mayor Alvin Brown. Both men are African-Americans with moderate reputations, and the contest may end up coming down to geography. Lawson is a longtime politician from Tallahassee, while Brown is well-known in the eastern part of the seat around Jacksonville. No other Democrats filed.

Lawson has struggled with fundraising, and he's in real danger of getting outspent. Brown outraised the incumbent $161,000 to $84,000 during his first quarter in the race; while Lawson still holds a $160,000 to $128,000 cash-on-hand edge, that advantage may not last long if he can't ramp up his fundraising efforts.

Lawson also may have made a costly mistake early this year when he was the one member of the Congressional Black Caucus to applaud when Trump declared he was ""very proud"" of the low rate of African-American unemployment. Trump, who called Democrats who didn't clap for him ""treasonous,"" praised Lawson and said he was ""going to send him a letter of thank you."" Brown also may have wanted to send the congressman a thank you note, since he already aired an ad in February hitting Lawson over this.

However, Brown has his own vulnerabilities on the left. He angered local Democrats in 2012 when he refused to endorse Obama's 2012 re-election campaign (though he later said he'd vote for him), and he also didn't back Democrat Charlie Crist two years later in his bid to unseat GOP Gov. Rick Scott. And as Tyler Yeargain wrote in a great 2015 piece on the eve of Brown's narrow re-election loss, the mayor also alienated supporters by refusing to push for an ordinance aimed at protecting LGBT residents, and there was a general perception that he hadn't done enough to help the African-American community.

â— FL-06: GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis is leaving this seat, which includes all of Volusia County in the Orlando area as well as some of Jacksonville's southern suburbs, to run for governor. This district moved from 52-47 Romney to 57-40 Trump, but both parties are fielding well-funded candidates here.

The GOP has a three-way primary between former state Rep. Fred Costello, wealthy businessman John Ward, and businessman and former Dick Cheney foreign policy adviser Michael Waltz. Costello sought this seat last cycle while DeSantis was running for what had been an open Senate seat, and he stayed in the race after DeSantis decided to seek re-election after Sen. Marco Rubio made the same move. Costello lost 61-25, but this time, a number of local office holders are backing him.

Costello is the only Republican on the ballot from Volusia, which makes up about 70 percent of the seat, which could give him an opening. However, Costello had just $16,000 on-hand at the end of March, which was just a fraction of what his rivals had available.

Ward announced he was running for this seat months before DeSantis made his gubernatorial bid official. That move reportedly very much annoyed DeSantis, but it's unclear if that will hurt Ward at all. Ward, who served in the Navy, has been doing some self-funding, and he had a hefty $709,000 in the bank. Not far behind is Waltz, a retired Green Beret commander who had $653,000 on-hand, much of it from his own wallet.

Waltz is also a former Fox contributor, but his time on the air may do him more harm than good. While Waltz has ardently supported Trump for years, he appeared in an anti-Trump video for the Koch brother's American Future Fund during the 2016 primary. Waltz told viewers, ""All Donald Trump has served is himself,"" and implored them, ""Don't let Donald Trump fool you. Look into his record, and stop Trump now."" These lines that are likely to haunt him into August.

National Democrats have consolidated behind Clinton-era Deputy National Security Advisor Nancy Soderberg, who had a solid $595,000 war chest at the end of March and is on the DCCC's Red to Blue list for top candidates. Soderberg's only other bid for office was in 2012, when she campaigned for an open state Senate seat over in the Jacksonville area (that seat does not overlap at all with the 6th Congressional District) and lost 62-38, running a little ahead of Obama's 65-34 defeat in the district.

But unexpectedly, two other Democrats whom we hadn't previously mentioned also brought in a credible amount of money during the first quarter of 2018. Radiologist Stephen Sevigny raised $174,000 from donors and self-funded another $76,000, leaving him with $227,000 in the bank. Travel agency owner John Upchurch took in $146,000 during this time and had $124,000 on-hand. Upchurch has the support of a few notable figures including Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood (who is also supporting Costello in the GOP primary).

â— FL-07: Democrat Stephanie Murphy unseated longtime Rep. John Mica 51.5-48.5 as this suburban Orlando seat was moving from a very narrow Obama win to a solid 51-44 Clinton. Republicans signaled early that Murphy would be one of their top targets, but they may end up focusing their resources elsewhere this cycle.

State Rep. Mike Miller has Sen. Marco Rubio's support, and he has experience winning in a competitive state House seat. However, Miller had only $271,000 on-hand at the end of March, not great for a candidate who has been running since July. Businessman Scott Sturgill, who has been doing some self-funding and got former Speaker John Boehner to hold a fundraiser for him, had a stronger $366,000 to spend. Former Senate aide Vennia Francois also filed, but she had just $3,000 in the bank.

P.S. While state Sen. David Simmons spent months insisting he was 98 percent sure he would run, he did not run.

â— FL-09: Freshman Rep. Darren Soto faces a Democratic primary challenge from his predecessor, former Rep. Alan Grayson, in this reliably blue suburban Orlando seat. Grayson spent over a year raising money for a congressional bid somewhere in Florida, and he led Soto $695,000 to $364,000 in cash-on-hand at the end of March.

Grayson also won't lack name-recognition, but that's not necessarily a good thing. Grayson has had a national following since 2009, when he summed up the GOP's healthcare plan as ""die quickly."" However, Grayson had a very bad relationship with national Democratic leaders, who sided with then-Rep. Patrick Murphy when they both ran in the 2016 primary for Senate.

During the campaign, Grayson attracted awful headlines on topics ranging from potential ethics violations to alleged domestic abuse. It didn't help him when he was caught on camera shoving a reporter for asking questions about the alleged incidents back in 2016: Grayson then had the temerity to accuse the reporter of assaulting him. Grayson ended up losing to Murphy 59-18, and while he did carry this seat, it was by a weak 39-36 margin.

Soto hasn't made too many enemies, and he's likely the favorite here. Demographics may also give the incumbent a boost: This seat also is home to the state's largest Puerto Rican population, which is unlikely to want to fire Soto, the state's first Puerto Rican congressman. Indeed, this region's Puerto Rican population has almost certainly grown larger since 2016 thanks to the influx of refugees following Puerto Rico's crisis recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017. But unfortunately, we can't quite rule out a Grayson upset no matter how much we want to.

â— FL-12: GOP Rep. Gus Bilirakis has never faced serious opposition since he was elected in 2006 to succeed his father, but Democrats are fielding a credible opponent this time. Former FBI agent and federal prosecutor Chris Hunter raised $242,000 during his opening quarter, and he had $195,000 on-hand at the end of March. However, Bilirakis took in $272,000 during this time, and he had $493,000 in the bank. This seat, which includes Tampa and St. Petersburg's northern suburbs, went from an already tough 53.0-45.5 Romney to a nasty 57-39 Trump.

â— FL-13: You know it's a bad year for the GOP when they can't find a credible candidate to take on freshman Rep. Charlie Crist, the Florida Democrat they most love to hate. While Crist only unseated GOP Rep. David Jolly 52-48 as this St. Petersburg seat was moving from 55-44 Obama to just 50-46 Clinton, neither of his two GOP rivals look very serious.

â— FL-15: GOP Rep. Dennis Ross unexpectedly decided to retire weeks before the filing deadline, and six Republicans filed to succeed him. The seat moved from 52-47 Romney to 53-43 Trump, and while Ross looked safe, Team Blue may now take more of an interest in putting this district into play.

The early GOP frontrunners look like state Rep. Ross Spano and former state Rep. Neil Combee, who hail from different parts of this district. Spano represents a seat in Hillsborough County in the Tampa suburbs, while Combee held a district based in Polk County before he resigned in November to briefly serve as state executive director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Service. Spano may be best known for sponsoring a successful resolution this year declaring pornography a ""public health risk"" and expressing ""the need for education, prevention, research and policy change to protect citizens of this state.""

For his part, Combee made news last year when he wrote a Facebook post the day a white supremacist in Charlottesville murdered protestor Heather Heyer. Combee wrote that he didn't know much about what had just happened, but proceeded to compare it to how construction worker Reginald Denny was nearly beaten to death during the 1992 Los Angeles riots (which he described in great detail). Combee insisted afterwards that he condemned white supremacy, but he had brought up Denny to argue that innocent bystanders were put in danger when the people protesting the Unite the Right rally showed up.

A few other Republicans are also in, and they may have the connections to run a serious campaign. One of them is Sean Harper, whom the Tampa Bay Times identifies as a prominent homebuilder. Danny Kushmer, the executive director of the International Responsible Farming Council, may also be worth keeping an eye on. Kushmer served as a senior official at the Southwest Florida Water Management District before he went to his current group, which the Tampa Bay Reporter describes as a nonprofit that tells ""the American farmer's story through certification and participation in best management practices to ensure use of the latest food safety protocols.""

Several Democrats were running against Ross before he retired. The local establishment seemed to prefer Navy veteran Andrew Learned, but he had only $39,000 in the bank at the end of March. Attorney Kristen Carlson, a former General Counsel for the Florida Department of Citrus and self-described ""fiscal conservative,"" entered the race just before the deadline.

â— FL-16: GOP Rep. Vern Buchanan was re-elected with little trouble in 2016 as his Sarasota-area seat moved from 54-45 Romney to 54-43 Trump, but he's in for a tougher race this time. National Democrats are excited about personal injury attorney David Shapiro, who has proven to be a strong fundraiser. Team Red also got a scare a few months ago when James Buchanan, who happens to be the congressman's son, lost a high-profile local state House special election by a 52-45 margin in a 51-46 Trump seat.

However, this won't be an easy pickup for Democrats by any means. An April poll for the Democratic group Patriot Majority USA gave Buchanan a hefty 49-37 lead over Shapiro, and the incumbent enjoys a large $2.57 million to $498,000 cash-on-hand edge. Buchanan has already begun airing ads, so it doesn't look like he'll be running a complacent campaign.

â— FL-17: GOP Rep. Tom Rooney is retiring from a reliably red seat that includes part of the Sarasota area as well as areas further inland. The GOP primary pits state Sen. Greg Steube against state Rep. Julio Gonzalez, who both represent legislative districts along the coast.

Gonzalez, who has Sen. Marco Rubio's support, ended March with a huge financial edge. Gonzalez outraised Steube $82,000 to $49,000 and self-funded another $150,000 (Steube loaned his campaign $15,000), leaving him with a $230,000 to $56,000 cash-on-hand edge. However, Steube has the support of the anti-tax Club for Growth, which often spends in GOP primaries.

But while this contest may shape up to be an establishment vs. anti-establishment primary, both candidates are very far to the right. Gonzalez pushed for a ""religious freedom"" bill in 2015 that could have allowed adoption agencies to turn away same-sex couples and let some businesses deny them services, a proposal that infuriated LGBT groups. For his part, Steube has made his name by trying to loosen any restrictions on firearms.

â— FL-18: GOP Rep. Brian Mast, an Army veteran who lost his legs in Afghanistan, won an expensive open seat race by a decisive 54-43 as this coastal district was moving from 51-48 Romney to 53-44 Trump. But national Democrats are planning to target this seat, which includes St. Lucie County, Martin County, and the northern part of Palm Beach County. The Democratic group House Majority PAC has reserved $420,000 in fall TV time for this area.

The Democratic primary frontrunner is former State Department official Lauren Baer, who is on the DCCC's Red-to-Blue list for top candidates. Navy veteran Pam Keith, who took 15 percent statewide in the 2016 Senate primary, is also in. Keith has the support of VoteVets, but her fundraising hasn't been impressive: At the end of March, Baer led Keith in cash-on-hand $708,000 to $50,000.

However, Mast is a very strong fundraiser himself, and he had $1.53 million in the bank. Wealthy physician Mark Freeman, who took just 16 percent of the vote in the 2016 primary, is running again. Freeman entered the race with a truly strange ad, and it's unclear if he'll spend heavily here again.

â— FL-25: National Democrats spent months trying to recruit a viable candidate against GOP Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, and they got one just before the filing deadline when former state Judge Mary Barzee Flores ended her campaign for the neighboring 27th District and jumped in here.

Barzee Flores, who had just shy of $400,000 in the bank at the end of March, is well-connected. She was nominated by Barack Obama for a federal judgeship, and South Florida's legal community, including many Republicans, strongly supported her and were not happy when Sen. Marco Rubio blocked her.

After a year of silence, Rubio finally said he was holding up Barzee Flores' nomination because she hadn't fully disclosed her ties to the ACLU and EMILY's List. He also pointed to a criminal 2001 trial where Barzee Flores served as a public defender, though not the lead attorney; years later, her client's conviction was overturned after he argued he had ineffective council. One fellow Republican, a former U.S. attorney, berated Rubio for engaging in ""extreme political partisanship."" While of course Rubio wasn't shamed into lifting his blockade, the whole affair demonstrates that Barzee Flores has some influential allies, which will be important in what will be a tough race.

This seat, which stretches from Hialeah in the Miami area to Florida's Gulf Coast, went from 54-45 Romney to 50-48 Trump. However, this area has a large Cuban-American voting bloc that's reliably supported the Diaz-Balart family for decades (his brother, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, represented much of this turf until he retired in 2010), and usually votes Republican down the ballot. Diaz-Balart also had $1.2 million in the bank, so he's not exactly being caught unprepared.

â— FL-26: While this Miami-area seat, which includes Key West, went from 55-44 Obama to 57-41 Clinton, no one thinks that GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo will be a pushover. Curbelo has made sure to criticize Trump at the right times while still supporting much of his agenda, and he's a strong fundraiser. This is also another seat with a large Cuban-American population that often supports Democratic presidential candidates while backing the GOP for almost everything else.

Democrats have consolidated behind businesswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who faces little primary opposition. Mucarsel-Powell lost a 2016 bid to state Sen. Anitere Flores 54-46, but she impressed party leaders even in defeat. While Curbelo held a huge $2.1 million to $702,000 cash-on-hand lead at the end of March, Mucarsel-Powell has the resources to run a serious race. Outside groups on both sides have reserved millions in fall TV time here.

â— FL-27: Entrenched GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen's retirement gives Democrats one of their best pickup opportunities anywhere in the nation, though it's still not quite a slam-dunk. While this Miami-area seat went from 53-46 Obama all the way to 59-39 Clinton, this is yet another seat where the GOP still does well down ballot. And while the GOP candidates struggled to raise money here for months, that may be changing.

Ros-Lehtinen has spoken well of local Spanish-language TV journalist Maria Elvira Salazar, who entered the race in March. Salazar quickly raised a credible $303,000, and she had $288,000 on-hand after a month in the race. Former Miami-Dade County Commissioner Bruno Barreiro, who resigned due to the state's new resign-to-run law, also ramped up his fundraising after several meh quarters, and he had $421,000 on-hand. Several other candidates are running for Team Red, but none of them seem viable. The one exception may be Angie Chirino, a Latin Grammy winning songwriter and the daughter of the well-known Cuban singer Willy Chirino, but she had only $14,000 on-hand.

On the Democratic side, former University of Miami President and longtime Clinton ally Donna Shalala is the frontrunner. Shalala was widely praised for her leadership of the University of Miami when she stepped down in 2015, but she did have some controversies that could cause her trouble on the campaign trail. Perhaps most notably, a prominent donor named Nevin Shapiro provided expensive gifts to football players before he went to jail for a $930 million Ponzi scheme. Environmentalists were also unhappy with Shalala for selling land to a developer for a Walmart rather than setting it aside for preservation. Shalala recently turned 77, and it's unclear if her age will be a factor here.

Shalala won't lack money, though. She raised $640,000 during her first quarter and self-funded another $534,000, leaving her with a $1.1 million war chest. Several of Shalala's other opponents also have plenty of cash, but they may need a lot to go right if they want to break through and emerge as her main foe. State Rep. David Richardson, who has done some self-funding in past quarters, ended March with $1 million in the bank.

Former Miami Herald reporter Matt Haggman, who stepped down as Miami program director for the Knight Foundation before running, also had $870,000 on-hand. Former Miami Beach Commissioner Kristen Rosen Gonzalez had a considerably smaller $137,000 to spend. Rosen Gonzalez weirdly told one of her rivals in early April that no one, including her, could beat Shalala in a primary, but she stayed in the race anyway.

â— MA-07: Late last week, former Gov. Deval Patrick endorsed Rep. Mike Capuano over Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley in the September primary for this safely blue seat. Patrick is the most prominent African-American politician in the state, and his support could matter in a contest where race is a major theme (Capuano is white and Pressley is black). However, Patrick's endorsement for his old ally isn't a big surprise: Capuano backed Patrick in his 2006 primary when he still looked like a long-shot, and Patrick's wife supported Capuano's unsuccessful 2009 Senate campaign.

â— NY-11: What would a Mike Grimm race be without allegations of criminal misconduct? And this one is as bizarrely New York as they come: Last month, New York 1 reported that a Grimm campaign staffer named Joe Shikhman filed a petition with the Board of Elections to get a candidate on the ballot, but that candidate was not his boss. Rather, it was for the man Grimm is trying to unseat in next month's GOP primary, Rep. Dan Donovan, and now the incident has prompted the board to refer the matter to prosecutors. Allow us to explain.

Donovan, it turns out, had filed petitions of his own to place his name on four different ballot lines: those belonging to the Republican, Independence, Conservative, and Reform Parties. Moments before the deadline, though, Shikhman added an additional page of signatures for the Reform line on petitions bearing Donovan's name but his own signature.

That turned Donovan's Reform petitions from a single-volume filing into a multi-volume submission, the latter of which requires a cover sheetâ€”which, of course, Donovan's petitions lacked. Shikhman's shenanigans were therefore designed to knock Donovan off the Reform Party's line (the party had endorsed him earlier this year).

Grimm's campaign responded by calling the ""allegations of illegality"" ""absurd,"" but of course it couldn't deny that Shikhman had in fact submitted petitions. So with classic Grimm chutzpah, his team snarked that since ""Donovan was frantically seeking paid help to get his signatures, we thought we'd help him out for free.""

They may not be chuckling for very long, though: The Board of Elections has asked no fewer than six different prosecutors to look into the stunt. There's no word as to whether any are investigating yet, but seeing as the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn sent Grimm to jail for tax fraud a few years ago, they're probably only too happy to reopen their file on him.

â— PA-07: NARAL has dropped $52,000 on a media buy in the Democratic primary against Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli over his opposition to reproductive rights. There is no copy of any ad available yet.

â— PA-13: The anti-tax Club for Growth hasn't endorsed anyone in next week's crowded GOP primary for this safely red seat, but they're very much opposing physician John Joyce. The Club has spent a total of $350,000, including $260,000 on a TV buy, hitting Joyce. Their spot argues that Joyce donated to a PAC that supports liberal Democrats, and donated to former Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell.

Meanwhile, a like-minded group is up with an ad for state Rep. Stephen Bloom. House Freedom Action, which is allied with the far-right Freedom Caucus, is up with a 15-second spot arguing that Bloom will be a reliable Trump ally. There is no word on the size of the buy.

â— TX-02: A group called American Patriots PAC has launched a $120,000 buy in support of retired Navy SEAL Dan Crenshaw and against state Rep. Kevin Roberts ahead of the May 22 GOP primary runoff. Their spot argues that Crenshaw is a conservative outsider, and praises him for deploying back to Afghanistan twice even after losing an eye. The narrator also argues that Roberts is a typical politician who is just smearing his heroic opponent. A super PAC called With Honor also has been airing ads touting Crenshaw's service, though they haven't gone after Roberts.

Former Gov. Rick Perry, who now serves as secretary of energy, also endorsed Crenshaw this week.

â— TX-05: The Club for Growth is taking another whack at state Rep. Lance Gooden ahead of the May 22 GOP runoff. Their new spot argues that while Trump cut taxes, Gooden voted to raise them multiple times.

â— TX-21: The Club for Growth says they're spending $250,000 on a TV spot promoting Chip Roy, a former chief of staff to Sen. Ted Cruz, ahead of the May 22 GOP runoff. The narrator says Roy will fight unelected judges, combat wasteful spending, and stand up to bureaucrats.

â— VA-05: As expected, journalist Leslie Cockburn secured the Democratic nomination for Virginia's 5th Congressional District at the party's convention on Saturday, winning 146 votes to 62 for attorney Andrew Sneathern and 28 for Marine veteran Roger Dean Huffstetler, who'd released his delegates. Cockburn will now face GOP Rep. Tom Garrett in the fall, though this district, which went 53-42 for Trump, will be heavy lift for Democrats.

â— VA-10: Former State Department official Alison Friedman is the first candidate up with a TV spot ahead of the June 12 Democratic primary to take on GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock. Friedman tells the audience that too many parents know what it's like to hear there's been a lockdown at a local school and worry that it was at their children's school. Friedman pledges to stand up to the NRA and declares that Comstock ""sold our kid's safety to the NRA. I'm running to take it back.""

â— WA-08: After receiving much criticism for releasing a poll of Washington's all-party top-two primary that only featured the opinions of self-identified Democrats, pediatrician Kim Schrier has now shared the full results of that survey, reflecting the entire primary electorate.

Unsurprisingly, it shows the only Republican in the race, former state Sen. Dino Rossi, far out ahead at 48 percent, while Schrier is a distant second at 14. Attorney Jason Rittereiser, who complained loudly about Schrier's poll, takes 6, while former CDC official Shannon Hader, the third notable Democrat, is at 5. Rittereiser's own poll similarly had Rossi at the front with 43 percent but gave Schrier 6 percent and himself 4.

Schrier's survey, which was conducted by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, also tested former state GOP chair Chris Vance, who left the Republican Party last year in disgust over Donald Trump. Vance earns 7 percent of the vote, but he's not actually running, though he did recently tell the Seattle Times' Jim Brunner that he's ""intrigued"" by all the numbers he's seen.

The Trump administration is considering allowing schools to access federal education funding to purchase guns for teachers, US media report.

The Department of Education (DoE) is looking at allowing states to use academic enrichment funds for firearms, the New York Times first reported.

The federal grant being considered for this purpose is one that does not specifically prohibit buying weapons.

Congress forbids using federal funds for school safety to purchase weapons.

DoE spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill told CBS News: ""The department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety.""

""The secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios,"" she added.

In the wake of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting in March that left 17 people dead, US lawmakers passed a $50m (Â£39m) school safety bill that approved spending on metal detectors, locks and other security - but expressly forbade the purchase of guns.

US media report that the DoE is now turning to Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants to serve as a way of arming teachers and school officials with federal funds.

The enrichment programme is meant ""to improve students' academic achievement"" through providing a well-rounded education, improving school conditions for learning and improving the use of technology and digital literacy, according to the education department website.

These grants do not contain language barring the use of funds to buy weapons, allowing Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to approve or deny any state spending plans to use funding for weapons or firearm training.

The DoE is reportedly weighing whether buying guns could fall under the goal of improving school conditions, according to the Times.

Currently, states are able to approve programmes giving teachers and staff permission to carry weapons, including concealed firearms.

At least 14 states already have provisions allowing teachers to carry guns in school.

Democrats and gun control activists were quick to condemn the report.

Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut responded to these reports on Thursday morning by introducing an amendment to a funding bill that would bar the education department from letting schools use federal money to buy guns.

On Twitter, Mr Murphy shared a petition to ""tell Betsy DeVos: No guns in our classrooms"".

Fred Guttenberg, who lost his daughter in the Parkland shooting, tweeted that this plan ""would not have saved my daughter"".

But some educators are praising the idea of using federal funds to purchase weapons.

David Thweatt, a superintendent in north Texas, told the Washington Post schools would benefit from it.

""You have to make children feel secure. If they're constantly looking over their shoulder, they're not learning,"" he said.

President Donald Trump has called for arming teachers in response to recent school shootings in Florida and Texas.

He has created a school safety commission, led by Mrs DeVos, that is exploring possible security measures to prevent school shootings.

Earlier this year the commission established a $1.8m School-Age Trauma Training grant to provide training to public and high school students on how to respond to wounded victims.

The commission is due to release a final report later this year.",https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45288773,"['Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Republican']","['5', '5', '5', '1', '5']"
3KLL7H3EGEJ82C5JPJLCRN2NES9HVC,"3D-printed gun blueprints can be downloaded starting next month, ending lengthy legal battle","Blueprints for 3D-printed guns can be downloaded starting next month, following a landmark Department of Justice settlement with Second Amendment advocates.

Defense Distributed, a non-profit defense firm, will offer the blueprints for download starting Aug. 1 following a multiyear legal battle with the federal government.

â€œItâ€™s personally satisfying,â€ Defense Distributed director Cody Wilson told Fox News, adding Americaâ€™s gun culture has been â€œguaranteed safe passageâ€ into the modern era.

ARMY'S NEW MACHINE GUN WILL BLAST LIKE BATTLE TANKS

Defense Distributed and the Second Amendment Foundation were co-plaintiffs in a 2015 lawsuit against the government, which had forced Wilsonâ€™s firm to take blueprints for the â€œLiberatorâ€ 3D-printed gun off its website. More than 100,000 copies of the controversial blueprint were downloaded before the governmentâ€™s clampdown.

The settlement paves the way for Defense Distributed to again offer the Liberator files, and others for 3D-printed guns, on its website. â€œUnder terms of the settlement, the government has agreed to waive its prior restraint against the plaintiffs, allowing them to freely publish the 3-D files and other information at issue,â€ explained the Second Amendment Foundation in a statement released July 10.

SAF Founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb heralded the settlement as a victory for free speech, and â€œa devastating blow to the gun prohibition lobby.â€

GLOCK MAKES MILITARY-GRADE PISTOL AVAILABLE TO CIVILIANS

The organizations had filed their suit against the State Department under the Obama administration. In May 2013, the government had cited International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) when clamping down on Defense Distributed. In its statement SAF described ITAR is a Cold War-era law designed to control export of military items.

The settlement has sparked anger from gun control advocates. â€œWe're extremely concerned about a sudden settlement by the DOJ allowing blueprints for 3-D printed guns to be posted online, and we're looking forward to learning through our FOIA request exactly how this came to be,â€ tweeted the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence on July 13.

The Brady Campaign filed its Freedom of Information Act request on Jul. 12.

ARMY SETS SIGHTS ON NEW SNIPER RIFLE

â€œDuring the Obama years, the government thought that 3D printed guns posed a serious threat to national security. I'm not aware of anything that has changed except who sits in the White House,â€ Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, told Fox News in an emailed statement. â€œUntraceable and undetectable guns that bypass our bipartisan background check system put us all at risk. The country deserves answers from the Trump Administration about why it thinks this is a good idea. Making it easier for dangerous people to get guns is reckless and stupid, and this is going to make Americans less safe.""

Advocates for gun control have argued that 3D-printed guns could also pose security challenges as they pass through airport X-ray machines.

Wilson, who describes current 3D-printed guns as â€œmostly curiosities,â€ said that the â€œbigâ€ and â€œbulkyâ€ characteristics of the weapons would help identify them. â€œI doubt seriously that itâ€™s a real problem,â€ he added. â€œIf it is a problem, then the [security] norms will have to change.â€

US MILITARY EYES FUTURISTIC 'BIONIC ARM' FOR TROOPS

The State Department has also provided some context on the settlement. â€œThis was a voluntary settlement entered into following negotiations between the Department of State and the plaintiffs,â€ said a State Department spokesperson, in a statement emailed to Fox News. â€œThe court did not rule in favor of the plaintiffs in this case. In other contexts, courts have upheld ITAR controls on technical data.â€

â€œThe settlement in this case comes as the U.S. Government is reviewing comments on new proposed regulations to transfer oversight from the U.S. Department of State to the U.S. Department of Commerce of exports of firearms and related items that do not provide the United States with a critical military or intelligence advantage or, in the case of weapons, are not inherently for military end use, including many items that are widely available in retail outlets in the United States and abroad,â€ the spokesperson added. â€œThese proposed regulations are part of an ongoing effort to create a simpler, more robust export control system that eases industry compliance, enhances enforceability, and better protects truly sensitive technologies.â€

The State Department says that, in addition to reducing regulatory burden on U.S. industry, the proposed regulations would eliminate the ITAR requirements at issue in the Defense Distributed case.

â€œIn the course of formulating these proposed regulations, the U.S. Government conducted a national security analysis in the context of the rulemaking effort,â€ the spokesperson added. â€œBased on this analysis, it was determined that certain firearms and related items that are widely available for commercial sale, and technical data related to those items, is of a type that does not offer a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States.â€

(Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)

Student-led rallies around the country on Saturday aimed to show support for gun rights, but their effort drew smaller-than-expected crowds in a bid to counter the well-funded and organized youth gun-control lobby that emerged after the massacre at a Florida high school earlier this year.

Here in Chicago, people rallied in a corner of Millennium Park. In Los Angeles, protesters yelled â€œgun rights are human rightsâ€ as they marched near Pershing Square. In Washington, an American flag billowed against a backdrop of the Capitol as attendees said guns are being used as scapegoats and that societyâ€™s problems run deeper than firearms.

Students who say their views have been silenced in recent months as vocal gun-control advocates have been monopolizing attention used the marches as a way to raise awareness of their fears that hasty solutions could lead to an erosion of the Second Amendment.

Colin FitzSimmons, 13, of Algonquin, Ill., spoke at the Chicago rally, sounding alarms that liberal gun-control efforts really want to â€œto disarm the populace.â€ People held signs reading â€œweâ€™re not going awayâ€ and â€œtake back gun rights.â€

â€œOur generation isnâ€™t going to embrace gun control,â€ Colin said, noting that any changes to gun laws need to be carefully considered. â€œThe devil is in the details.â€

The rallies came amid a wave of gun-control activism sparked by the February shooting that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. It led to nationwide marches and backing from large groups and donors.

Organizers of Saturdayâ€™s marches said many conservative students feel as though their views are not being taken into consideration in the debate about school shootings, and the marches on Saturday were planned as a way to show that not all students support gun control.

Planning for Saturdayâ€™s rallies started in April, weeks after gun-control rallies took place in the District and other cities. Some of Saturdayâ€™s organizers found one another on Instagram and Facebook and decided to speak out against what they saw as an attack on gun ownership. They expected a modest turnout on Saturday, but far fewer people showed up than organizers had hoped.

In Chicago, organizers planned for about 125 people, but the rally drew approximately 35. The group gathered in a corner of Millennium Park, not on the Great Lawn, because organizers did not secure a permit and park security forced them to leave.

Earlier in the morning in the same city, hundreds of protesters shut down 10 blocks of the Dan Ryan Expressway, one of the busiest interstates in the United States. Their march along the highway was in protest of gun violence and gun-related deaths in Chicago, and the disruption drew widespread attention â€” and some scorn, from groups including the National Rifle Association.

The Second Amendment activists gathered about an hour later.

Kevin Yan, an 18-year-old University of Chicago student, said he is â€œan outlierâ€ at his school because he is passionate about the Second Amendment. He said he has never owned a gun and has never shot a gun, but he believes gun ownership is â€œa critical American traditionâ€ and â€œreally important for self-defense.â€

â€œThe media always says the millennial generation has decided itâ€™s against gun rights,â€ he said. â€œWe are here to show thatâ€™s not true.â€

In Palm Beach, Fla., about 100 people were expected to rally at a park; 13 came, including organizer Ashley Johnson, three speakers and the parents of two of the speakers.

The event was meant to be a counterpoint to the March for Our Lives rallies that attracted thousands across the country after the February shooting, including at events in Florida.

â€œThe goal is to be just as successful as March for Our Lives,â€ Johnson said. â€œWe want to outdo them.â€

Ralph Curra, 14, who was an eighth-grader at Westglades Middle School, which is adjacent to Stoneman Douglas, spoke at the event. He recalled hearing the screams from next door, and being on lockdown for five hours as the investigation began into the Feb. 14 attack.

Ralph spoke to the small crowd about his experience, and about how it prompted him to research guns and gun violence. He said changes to Florida gun laws enacted after the Parkland shooting are misguided.

â€œRaising the age to buy a gun, all you parents out there, when you send your child to college, donâ€™t you want them to be able to protect themselves from criminals?â€ he asked. â€œThe new laws will leave your child vulnerable to attack in todayâ€™s dangerous society.â€

[Florida Gov. Rick Scott breaks with NRA to sign new gun regulations]

Johnson said she was disappointed in the turnout.

â€œI donâ€™t know why more people didnâ€™t show up. I think a lot of conservatives are just afraid to show up for public events,â€ she said through tears.

In the District, a few dozen high schoolers, college students and recent graduates came together near the Capitol for the Second Amendment march. American flags and â€œMake America Great Againâ€ hats dotted the crowd.

Tyler Yzaguirre, president of the Second Amendment Institute, told the gathering that although they were few in number, they would show the left that no one should be afraid to defend their rights.

Organizer Morgan Sachs greeted the group and thanked everyone for coming.

â€œThe media doesnâ€™t seem to like to talk about pro-gun students, they only want to talk about Â­anti-gun rhetoric,â€ she said. â€œOur voices are going to be heard now.â€

On June 29, 2017, Breitbart News reported that U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez blocked the ban to prevent law-abiding citizens from being criminalized. ABC News quoted from Benitezâ€™s ruling, â€œIf this injunction does not issue, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of otherwise law-abiding citizens will have an untenable choice: become an outlaw or dispossess oneâ€™s self of lawfully acquired property.â€

The â€œhigh capacityâ€ magazine ban was the result of a Proposition passed by the majority of California voters, but Benitez said, â€œâ€œ[The] constitution is a shield from the tyranny of the majority.â€

The state of California appealed Benitez ruling and on July 17, 2018, a panel from the Ninth Circuit upheld the ruling.

The panel voted 2 to 1, and the NRA-ILA reports that the two judges who voted to uphold the ruling â€œchided the dissenting judge for substituting his own discretion for that of Judge Benitez, who had the primary responsibility to evaluate and weigh the evidence in the case.â€

The state of California can now appeal the case for the Ninth Circuit to hear en banc.

3XD2A6FGFOCZVE6WXCSF3JKSWB7S9S,Russian envoy: Moscow open to Putin visit to Washington,"next

prev

Moscow is ready to discuss a possible visit by President Vladimir Putin to Washington after a surprise invitation from President Donald Trump, Russia's ambassador to the U.S. said Friday.

With confusion still swirling around what the two men discussed behind closed doors in Helsinki earlier this week, Ambassador Anatoly Antonov said it's important to ""deal with the results"" of their first summit before jumping too fast into a new one.

He said he hadn't seen Trump's invitation himself, but that ""Russia was always open to such proposals. We are ready for discussions on this subject.""

The Kremlin has the final say, but hasn't responded yet to the proposal Trump made Thursday.

Antonov gave a few more details of what Trump and Putin talked about in Helsinki, but insisted that diplomatic discussions should remain discreet in order to be effective.

He notably acknowledged that the two men discussed a possible referendum in eastern Ukraine.

""This issue was discussed,"" he said, adding without elaborating that Putin made ""concrete proposals"" to Trump on solutions for the Ukraine conflict.

Trump tweeted that the two men discussed Ukraine but has not mentioned a referendum or revealed specifics of the Ukraine discussions. The U.S. and Russia have been on opposing sides of the conflict in Ukraine, unleashed after a popular uprising against a pro-Russian president and Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Ukraine and European powers are unlikely to support a referendum in the Donbass region, where pro-Russian separatists hold sway.

The Russian ambassador to Washington also denounced ""anti-Russian anger"" in the United States and reiterated denials of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election â€” interrupting a questioner to say ""We didn't interfere!""

He also reiterated denials of Russian involvement in the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Britain.

Antonov called Monday's summit in Helsinki a ""key event"" in international politics and laughed off suggestions that the two men made any ""secret deals.""

Antonov gave details of their discussions on arms control, but said the U.S. has been reluctant to back Russia's proposals so far. He said the summit notably made progress on U.S.-Russian cooperation on Syria's future.

Meanwhile, Antonov also pushed for the release of a gun rights activist accused of being a covert agent in the U.S., calling her arrest a ""farce.""

U.S. federal prosecutors accused Maria Butina this week of being a covert Russian agent and working to infiltrate U.S. political organizations, including the National Rifle Association, before and after Donald Trump's election as president.

Butina, 29, denies wrongdoing, and the Russian Foreign Ministry started an online campaign for her release.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/07/20/russian-envoy-moscow-open-to-putin-visit-to-washington.html,"['Republican', 'Neutral', 'Republican', 'Democratic', 'Neutral']","['3', '2', '1', '1', '2']"
388CL5C1RK5567TPBFJ64E4LNHFHLB,Mike Pence's plan to outlast Trump (Opinion),"This article is the first in a series of three by Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner, the authors of the new book, "" The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) Now familiar as a smiling, nodding presence at the President's side, Mike Pence was little known outside of his home state of Indiana when Donald Trump selected him as his running mate in 2016. A bit more than two years later, as he crisscrosses America to campaign for Republicans in the midterm elections, Pence is setting himself up to replace his boss if Trump leaves office early or does not seek re-election.

""Mike will be ready"" is the line Pence's aides and allies use as they contemplate his place in a post-Trump world.

Pence would never admit this. He plays the part of unctuous toady so fully that the conservative writer George Will called him ""America's most repulsive public figure."" But don't be fooled. The vice president is doggedly pursuing his own ambitions on the side. The Oval Office has been his goal since high school. He has seeded the federal government with his loyalists and is building his own nationwide political organization.

He is acting, in fact, as if he is on a mission from God. Some may laugh, but many conservative Christians believe that God is merely using Trump to prepare the way for a so-called true man of faith. Pence's rise to power would affirm the "" Cyrus prophecy, "" which became a popular notion among Christian right circles when Pence joined the 2016 ticket.

Cyrus was a Persian king whom the Old Testament credits with returning the Jews to Jerusalem. He was a pagan who nevertheless served God. Right-wing evangelists such as Lance Wallnau cited that tale in 2016 when they declared that Trump -- a profane and sinful man -- could nevertheless do God's work and was thus worthy of conservative Christian votes. An estimated 80% of white evangelicals gave Trump their votes.

The story of Cyrus resonates with many right-wing Christians because they imagine themselves to be persecuted like the Jews of old. Despite their vast wealth, power and numbers, these believers cite developments such as same-sex marriage and the use of ecumenical phrases such as ""happy holidays,"" instead of Merry Christmas, as evidence they are a minority under siege. They imagine themselves to be victims of a culture war and feel that something must be done to defend an old order that they once dominated.

As a radio host, member of Congress and then governor of Indiana, Pence made himself the most successful conservative Christian politician of his generation. Indeed he says he is ""a Christian, a conservative and a Republican in that order.""

During 12 years in Congress he never authored a single bill, but he did become a prominent advocate for banning abortion, defunding Planned Parenthood and restricting marriage only to heterosexual couples. In his one term as governor he overstepped when he signed a bill -- the so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- permitting discrimination against gay people, and was forced to seek a change in the law.

His rhetoric attacking abortion rights, adultery and even evolution (he says he doesn't believe in it) assured the Christian right that he was one of them.

When Trump offered Pence his spot on the ticket, the Republican Party's evangelical wing was over the moon. Pence was also a first-term governor facing a tough battle for re-election despite a longstanding and substantial GOP advantage in voter registration. His outspoken support for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act had alienated some centrist Republicans and, though Pence was genial enough, he was not the kind of campaigner who got folks fired up.

Offered a path out of struggling obscurity in Indiana, Pence didn't need a Bible prophecy to tell him it was OK to take the leap. He hitched his pious ambitions to a crude, twice-divorced, self-confessed sexual predator whose grasp of faith and Scripture appears nonexistent.

Pence's favorite Bible verse reads: ""For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."" He cites it when he discusses the opportunities that come his way, and to explain the confidence he brings to politics.

Pence's theology says that God selects in advance which individuals will become believers and rewards their faith regardless of what they do. This belief allows for all sorts of bad behavior, if it can be framed as supporting the ultimate goal of promoting the evangelical agenda.

Pence's loyalty to the President, even after the ""Access Hollywood"" tape exposed Trump as a serial sexual harasser, baffled many. It was reported at the time that Pence considered trying to replace Trump at the top of the ticket, but in the end he held his place and his tongue. Pence's religion explains that choice, and his decision to abandon many of his previous positions on the issues, such as his opposition to banning Muslim visitors to America.

To understand how a seemingly pious politician such as Pence could join Trump and stick with him requires tracing the long path of his ambition. Pence wasn't always the rigidly moralistic and confident conservative evangelical he professes to be today. But he was, from the beginning of his adult life, a man who thought he was destined for the presidency.

A gunman charged through the doors of the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis on Thursday with a shotgun and smoke grenades, killing five people and prompting heightened security at newsrooms nationwide. Across the world, journalists â€” including Americans reporting from abroad â€” watched in disbelief as the news unfolded.

â€œIâ€™ve reported from China, Iâ€™ve reported from North Korea, Iâ€™ve reported from Russia. But I was never worried about getting shot and killed in any of those countries,â€ said Melissa Chan, an American freelance journalist based in Berlin. â€œThere are other ways of getting hurt, but dying in a mass shooting was not in the cards â€” even in an authoritarian country.â€

Rohollah Faghini, a Tehran-based Iranian who has worked as a journalist for more than a decade, said the event shocked reporters in his country. â€œI have seen news of shootings in America, but I have never seen people shooting at journalists. Even in Iran, Iâ€™ve never seen something like this happen,â€ he said.

There is nothing more terrifying than hearing multiple people get shot while you're under your desk and then hear the gunman reload â€” Phil Davis (@PhilDavis_CG) June 28, 2018

Christopher Miller, an American who writes for Radio Free Europe from Kiev, Ukraine, said he reacted to the news with â€œmeasured shockâ€ because he has been observing changes in the press environment in the United States for several years.

[After newsroom shootings, a quick collapse into blame and division in a polarized country]

According to a report released by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press this year, there were 45 physical attacks on journalists in the United States in 2017. The report also recorded 19 â€œegregious public threatsâ€ made to reporters and media organizations, 17 of them by President Trump, who has referred to the media as â€œthe enemy of the peopleâ€ on multiple occasions.

â€œThis is something we see from authoritarian leaders in the former Soviet Union, not the sort of rhetoric that weâ€™re used to see Western leaders use,â€ Miller said. â€œJournalists from this part of the world have always looked to the U.S. and the West as a bastion of free speech . . . [but] in the last couple of years, in my conversations with journalists in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, theyâ€™re shocked at what theyâ€™ve heard.â€

In 2016, a Ukrainian journalist and a good friend of Millerâ€™s, Pavel Sheremet, died mysteriously in a car bombing near his house. Sheremet worked as an investigative reporter in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus for decades, receiving dozens of threats in his lifetime. Two years after the bombing, his case remains unsolved. Dozens took to the streets in central Kiev last year to ask, â€œWho killed Pavel Sheremet?â€

[Iâ€™m a Ukrainian journalist, and Iâ€™m tired of living in fear]

â€œI have seen what happens when the media is targeted by people in power, when they are targeted because of their work,â€ Miller said. Journalists in the United States, he added, â€œnow need to think about their reporting in a way that a correspondent has to: with escape plans and personal safety plans.â€

Khaled Diab, a Belgian-Egyptian journalist in Tunisia, agreed. â€œAs a journalist based in the Middle East, I know what the vilification of the media â€” what results it can achieve,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m very concerned for my American colleagues.â€

By and large, reporters in the United States operate in a markedly safer environment than in places such as Russia, North Korea or Saudi Arabia, all of which were ranked near the bottom in terms of press freedoms this year. But according to foreign correspondents, what sets the country apart is the easy access to firearms.

â€œThe combination of [Trumpâ€™s] demonizing rhetoric and the lax gun laws is a very toxic and potent cocktail,â€ Diab said.

For Cherian George, a Singaporean professor of media studies in Hong Kong and a former reporter at the Straits Times in Singapore, the Annapolis shooting was not particularly shocking, given the history of gun violence in the United States.

â€œThe world already finds it inexplicable that a civilized country like the U.S. considers it tolerable and acceptable to have this degree of gun violence as a routine part of their lives,â€ he said. â€œ[This is] a country that cannot protect children from being gunned down regularly in their own schools â€” why should anyone expect that newsrooms are safe?â€

Theodore Roosevelt Coach Chris Harden found two of his best players by taking them from the basketball team. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)

Theodore Roosevelt Coach Chris Harden has more than a few stories about finding football players, but the best has to be the one about Leon Gray.

Gray came to the Northwest Washington high school as a basketball hopeful and took part in the teamâ€™s summer workouts before his freshman year in 2015. One afternoon Hardenâ€™s squad was practicing near the track where Gray was doing conditioning, and a loose football rolled over.

Gray picked it up and threw it back. The throw had some zip to it, and some people got to talking about the boyâ€™s arm. Gray had played football with his friends and neighbors growing up and knew that he could toss it pretty far. But he had never played for a team, never thought about the game, or his arm, too seriously.

That summer afternoon was a good chance to test himself. So he walked to midfield, aimed for the goal posts and, without so much as a run-up or a grunt, calmly let it fly. His throw sailed through the uprights. Harden was watching.

â€œYou shouldâ€™ve seen his face,â€ Gray said.

[Gun violence in New Orleans has given a champion football coach one mission: Keep his players alive]

Gray joined Rooseveltâ€™s football team a few weeks after that throw, and he has been the starting quarterback ever since. In three years under center he has helped guide the Rough Riders through a swift ascension, winning two Gravy Bowls and a D.C. State Athletic Association (DCSAA) title and earning a promotion from the DCIAAâ€™s Stripes Division to the more prestigious Stars Division.

Roosevelt keeps winning in part because Harden keeps filling the roster however he can, piecing together teams a fraction of the size of the best Maryland or Virginia public squads by rounding up freshman, converting other athletes, securing transfers and hunting down big-bodied talent in the school hallways. To players like Gray, Harden finds himself doing something once practically unheard of in the D.C. area: He makes a pitch for football.

â€œWe donâ€™t always have 100 kids coming out for the program,â€ Harden said. â€œYouâ€™re more likely to have 30, 40 kids. So we do what we can.â€

Defensive end and wide receiver Darrius Buchanan has received Division I interest in football. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)

Roosevelt does not have a large enrollment, so getting numbers for football has always been a challenge. It has never suspended a football season because of low participation like two Northern Virginia schools did this summer, but it came close in Hardenâ€™s first year at the helm. The program was returning just three players from a team that went 2-8. The first-year coach and his staff scrambled for athletes and ended up playing the season with about 25 players on the roster.

â€œFirst thing I did was walk around the school and just said to kids, â€˜Hey, you want to play football? Youâ€™ve got nice size,â€™ â€ Harden said. â€œAnyone that said â€˜I donâ€™t knowâ€™ or â€˜maybe,â€™ I got them out here.â€

The biggest fish Harden caught this way was Darrius Buchanan. The 6-foot-3, 223-pound senior was a power forward on the basketball team when Harden approached him before his junior season. Buchanan hadnâ€™t played football since middle school, but the coach told him that there were opportunities for him in the sport. Harden could mold him into a football player. A college football player.

â€œI had to face reality that basketball wasnâ€™t my way out,â€ Buchanan said. â€œSo [Coach Harden] talked me into getting on the field, and it has been benefiting me ever since.â€

[Football Top 20: DeMatha shut out as football gets underway in VA, D.C.]

Playing wide receiver and defensive end, Buchanan quickly emerged as one of the best players on the team and in the District. He finished the year with six sacks and eight total touchdowns, earning the U.S. Army impact player of the month award. Like Gray, Buchanan went from being a basketball player to receiving Division I interest for football.

â€œIf they have athleticism or size, thatâ€™s all we need,â€ Harden said of players like Buchanan. â€œBecause if you have the football body and size, we can teach you something.â€

While football offered a route to college athletics, it was arguably a riskier option than basketball. In 2018, you canâ€™t discuss the viability of football without bringing up the potential for concussions and lasting brain injuries. But Buchanan said he didnâ€™t think too much about it and didnâ€™t have to convince his parents, because they trusted Harden. Gray said the risk of injury was on his mind at first, but in three years he has only rolled an ankle.



â€œIf they have athleticism or size, thatâ€™s all we need,â€ said Coach Chris Harden. â€œBecause if you have the football body and size, we can teach you something.â€ (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)

â€œWhen weâ€™re recruiting, we may get two or three kids in a year who say my parents wonâ€™t let me because theyâ€™re afraid I might get a concussion, or kids who donâ€™t want to get hurt,â€ Harden said. â€œBut thatâ€™s just two or three kids, maybe.â€

To Harden, football offers a different kind of safety. He pointed to a new student orientation the school held this week, and how all the football players knew each other when they walked in. High school is often four years of trying to find things to be a part of and determining what should be a part of you. Football can help with that.

â€œOur pitch is: â€˜Come be a part of something,â€™ Harden said. â€œWhat I tell them is we have fun. Itâ€™s structured. Itâ€™s like a brotherhood, a family. You never feel alone.â€

The team has about 40 players this year, and when they break up into positional groups during a recent afternoon practice itâ€™s hard to tell the units apart. Yes, there are some hulking figures that are clearly linemen, but not many. More than a standard football team, they look like a collection of athletes, thrown together because they went for the same pitch at some point in their lives.

On the sideline, Buchanan sits and catches his breath, happy with how his team is practicing so close to the start of the season. He is asked about how he thinks of himself now, a year after Harden approached him and a few days before his senior year of high school.

3B623HUYJ58ZH9NMSKM13NPHCSXS8L,Former Obama official says Trump wants an uneducated workforce due to his 'authoritarian tendencies',"Former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan suggested that President Donald Trump is intentionally harming the American education system in order to institute an authoritarian government on Thursday.

Duncan told CNN, ""I'm not sure President Trump wants to have the best-educated workforce. I think it doesn't play to his authoritarian tendencies.""

Duncan's comments are the latest in a string of criticisms he's lobbed toward the current administration.

While out promoting his new book, Duncan has taken a number of opportunities to criticize the leadership of both the president and current Education Secretary head Betsy DeVos.

Speaking on CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday, Duncan talked about how the education system ""runs on lies.""

The toughest lie, he said, is that ""we say we value kids and we've raised a generation of young people teens who have been raised on mass shootings and gun violence. And that simply doesn't happen in other nations.""

The former secretary went on to tell host Margaret Brennan that he feels ""a huge sense of urgency"" to fix the U.S. education system.

""We have got to get better, faster as a nation,"" he said. ""We're not top 10 in anything.""

Duncan then criticized DeVos, saying she doesn't understand some basic concepts of education policy.

When pressed to explain further, Duncan said of DeVos, ""You probably saw in the news -- for me it was just a crazy metaphor -- that about a week ago her yacht was found adrift. $40 million yacht just out there. For me that sort of represents where they are in terms of education policy. There isn't one.""

The name of Duncan's book is ""How Schools Work,"" and is being published by Simon &amp; Schuster, which is a division of CBS Corporation. A review published in the Chicago Tribune last week proclaimed, ""Arne Duncan's 'How Schools Work' is really about politics.""

Duncan hasn't been afraid to wade into public discourse in the past, either. Last year, he joined former assistant education secretary for civil rights, Catherine Lhamon, in writing an op-ed slamming the Trump administration's decision to withdraw guidance on bathroom access for transgender students.

The title of the piece was ""The White House's thoughtless, cruel and sad rollback of transgender rights.""

3HJ1EVZS2P11FXH31ER0MWCAAS8R32,"Nashville, civil rights and the 'destiny of dissent'","1968: Nashville, civil rights and the 'destiny of dissent'

Jessica Bliss | USA TODAY NETWORK â€“ Tennessee

When Robert F. Kennedy's plane touched down at Nashville's Municipal Airport, a 30-foot banner stretched across the lobby entrance.

It read, ""Suddenly there's hope for America.""

The crush of the wall-to-wall crowd who had come to get a glimpse of Kennedy reinforced the intensity and the urgency of the times.

It was March 21, 1968, and Kennedy â€” who five days earlier had announced his candidacy for president â€” was on his way to speak at Vanderbilt University's Impact symposium.

The event, established in 1964 to give students a voice in an unsettling age, was focused that year on the â€œDestiny of Dissent.â€

Dissent had become part of Nashville's disposition. From the success of the sit-ins in 1960 to the pursuit of John Lewisâ€™ famous â€œgood troubleâ€ protests, student-led movements in the city fueled civil disobedience and fostered change.

""You can't stop that kind of avalanche of pride and hope,"" says Nashville civil rights dignitary Kwame Leo Lillard, who helped desegregate Nashville's lunch counters, movie theaters and downtown stores.

When Kennedy, the 42-year-old senator from New York, set foot in Music City, he embodied that spirit.

As Kennedy pushed through the airport mob, hundreds of sign-toting onlookers â€” many students â€” deafened him, shouting, â€œSpeech! Speech!â€

Kennedy obliged, climbing atop an escalator railing and offering an impromptu greeting from the precarious perch.

The crowd went crazy.

test

Frye Gaillard, the Vanderbilt student chairman of Impact that year, walked by his side.

As a biting wind whipped the rain outside, Gaillard attempted to put up his umbrella. The force of bodies, not the weather, ripped it from his hand, carrying it through the crowd between peopleâ€™s shoulders.

In the crush, it took Kennedy five minutes to walk 30 feet to a car waiting outside.

When he emerged from the throng, he slipped into the back seat alongside Gaillard and Impactâ€™s other speaker, astronaut John Glenn.

""It feels a little safer in here than out there,"" Gaillard said.

Kennedy smiled. ""Yes,"" he replied. ""It does.""

On the other side of the city, a crowd of 10,800 packed Vanderbilt University's Memorial Gymnasium, waiting impatiently for Kennedyâ€™s arrival.

He was two hours late.

Continuum of student-led crusades

Looking back, Gaillard marvels. The symposium nearly didnâ€™t happen that year.

It was a time of resistance, rebellion and deep reflection in the USA.

The idealism of equality ran stride for stride with the specter of war, and no one knew exactly what would be the defining feel of the decade.

Nashville, at the buckle of the Bible Belt, was considered a place of morality and keen enlightenment.

It was home to myriad colleges and universities, including Fisk, Vanderbilt, American Baptist, Meharry and Tennessee State (then Tennessee A&amp;I).

Although unrest raged overseas, the fight for civil rights gained momentum at home among student activists on the front lines.

Future congressman John Lewis attended American Baptist College in the early 1960s where he was trained to lead the nonviolent protests he would use to organize sit-ins.

Later, he studied at Fisk alongside future Freedom Rider Diane Nash, who boldly confronted Nashville Mayor Ben West in April 1960 on the steps of city's courthouse in front of 3,000 black marchers.

â€œMayor,â€ she asked, â€œdo you recommend that the lunch counters be desegregated?â€

To the shock of many, West said yes.

Nashville made history by becoming the first city in the South to integrate its lunch counters. That bolstered the black community.

""History really has a continuum,"" says Reavis Mitchell, a Nashville native and professor of history at Fisk. ""And we kept believing that optimism was going to roll over and multiply itself.""

By the time Mitchell enrolled as a student at historically black Fisk University in the summer of 1965, leaders such as Lewis and Nash had left their marks but moved on to bigger fights.

Two miles across town at the almost entirely white Vanderbilt, the landscape looked different.

There, civil rights were still taking shape.

Conservative, Southern and very segregated

Eileen Carpenter remembers that when her parents dropped her off at an ivy-covered entrance gate at Vanderbilt, the theme from The Twilight Zone played in her head.

""I just had this feeling it wasn't going to be good,"" the 70-year-old Baltimore real estate attorney recalls.

She saw only one other black woman.

It was 1965, and Vanderbilt had admitted its first black undergraduate students only the year before. Carpenter could count the number of black students on campus on her fingers.

""Nashville was just..."" She pauses. ""It was so conservative and very Southern and very segregated.""

Carpenter grew up in Nashville; her neighborhood on the east side of the Cumberland River boasted nice homes for black professionals, doctors, lawyers and professors.

She didn't know she wasn't allowed to go to certain swimming pools or to sit anywhere but the balconies of the city's movies theaters. Her parents simply said they didn't have enough time for those activities or couldn't afford them.

She watched as the black kids in her neighborhood were bused past the nearby white school while she attended the only integrated Catholic high school in town.

When the sit-ins at Woolworth's dime store downtown made the news, her parents' half-truths started to come undone.

As progress persisted, more opportunities presented themselves. Desegregation moved past lunch counters into affluent white universities.

For Carpenter, a lover of astronomy, Vanderbilt offered both Dyer Observatory and an astrophysics degree, which nearby Tennessee A&amp;I did not.

The chance to enroll was a great opportunity.

Vanderbilt, however, also had a contemptible history with race.

In the late 1950s, the Rev. James Lawson enrolled in Vanderbilt Divinity, in part so he could begin a push for social justice that Martin Luther King Jr. wanted him to start in Nashville.

Lawson conducted early morning classes in nonviolent resistance at a nearby church, where students role-played as demonstrators and attackers to prepare for the hatred they would encounter.

Despite the peaceful efforts, Vanderbilt officials were incensed about Lawsonâ€™s protest activities and expelled him.

By 1964, educational institutions in the South were forced to confront segregationist underpinnings.

A shift from nonviolent to proactive

The Vanderbilt student body tended to be more conservative than its radical protesting peers. But as violence broke out at Berkeley, Vanderbilt officials became concerned.

To address potential unrest, Chancellor Alexander Heard approved an initiative called Impact.

The program brought controversial figures selected by the students to campus and gave students an active role in addressing what they deemed unjust. The first Impact Symposium was held in 1964.

By 1967, Impact had tackled divisive topics such as sex, war and race. Speakers included Allen Ginsberg, Strom Thurmond, Martin Luther King Jr. and Stokely Carmichael.

The appearance of two high-profile black men in the recently desegregated Southern city emboldened some and enraged many others.

Carmichael, in particular, was a polarizing figure.

Tough-minded and militant, he served as head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the leading spokesman of the Black Power movement.

He often made national headlines for the incendiary actions he left in his wake.

â€œIt was your daddy's NAACP, your daddyâ€™s Martin Luther King,â€ Mitchell says. â€œStokely represented activism, not passive resistance. He was a romantic figure.""

And much reviled.

The Tennessee Senate passed a resolution chiding Impact planners for giving the â€œdangerous, unprincipled demagogue the dignity of its platform.""

Dozens of Vanderbilt donors wrote to the chancellor and organizing committee angry at the inclusion of Carmichael and King in Impact's lineup.

""Students do not need to drink from the gutter to know what's in the gutter,"" came one note to the chancellor, scrawled in cursive blue ink along the margin of a newspaper clipping showing the headline ""Carmichael Talk Draws Fire.""

'We're all in this together'

The day before Carmichael was to arrive at Vanderbilt, his advance team â€” four black men with bandoliers of bullets crisscrossing their chests and Roman sandals on their feet â€” strode into the office of the campus chaplain.

There to greet them was Gaillard, a tall, skinny white boy from Mobile, Ala.

""It fell to me,â€ Gaillard recalls, â€œto tell them we had death threats against Stokely, and to ensure his safety, we arranged to have police protection.""

Gaillard grew up in a place where white people implicitly believed they were better than black people. He didn't meet a white person who thought otherwise until he came to Vanderbilt.

He had never been as dogmatically certain about segregation as his parents. Joining Impact was his way of refuting the racism of his roots.

""We think of police as the occupying army,"" one of Carmichael's men responded brusquely.

Gaillard summoned his will.

""In this set of circumstances,"" he said, ""we need to think we're all in this together.""

The next day, when 85 policemen were prepared to keep the peace, Carmichael led a standing ovation from the crowd as King entered Memorial Gymnasium to evaluate equality. It was three days after King's politically charged anti-war speech at Riverside Church in New York.

In his deep and measured tone, King told the crowd of 3,500 that nonviolence was the most potent weapon. He also condemned the inequalities that inspired unrest.

""There is nothing more dangerous than the man who feels he has no status,"" he said.

""As long as justice for all people is postponed,"" he said, ""there will continue to be riots.""

He seemed to predict the future.

Riots and radical change

The following afternoon, Carmichael, 25, stood behind the very same podium and preached something completely different.

As he started his speech, a white student in the balcony unfurled a Confederate flag over the rail. Carmichael paused.

""Just as long as you don't burn down any of my churches,"" he said, a touch of Caribbean accent in his voice.

Then he began a sophisticated lecture on black power to a predominantly white audience.

In the crowd, Carpenter â€” late into her sophomore year at Vanderbilt â€” listened with special interest.

In her first year at Vanderbilt, she felt a crushing mix of loneliness and depression.

""Nobody called me names, nobody spit at me,"" she says. ""Everybody was polite. If they caught your eye, they might even smile. But it also seemed like you just werenâ€™t there. They just kind of ignored you.""

She wanted to transfer, maybe to Tennessee A&amp;I, the historically black university where her father taught, but she worried about the repercussions.

""I felt that it would embarrass my parents, that it would embarrass my race,"" she says. ""I thought maybe they wouldnâ€™t let more blacks in at Vanderbilt if I failed.â€

Carmichael's words enlightened her.

She attended Vanderbilt, but she wasn't a part of Vanderbilt.

""He opened my eyes to the fact (that) discrimination doesnâ€™t just have to be lynchings and throwing rocks at you,"" she says. ""Itâ€™s an assault on your humanity, and thatâ€™s real.""

It wasn't the first time Carpenter had seen Carmichael speak. A month earlier at Fisk, he talked to a small group of students in a classroom on campus.

She went with a girlfriend and approached him afterward to invite him to a meeting of black Vanderbilt students hoping to organize an Afro-American Association at the university.

The meeting was to take place at her parents' home after his speech at Impact.

He showed up â€” but nothing happened exactly as anticipated.

'They're rioting in Nashville'

As Carpenter paced her house awaiting the arrival of her esteemed guest, the city outside began to rage.

When her roommate arrived, throwing open the door of the Carpenters' brick, three-bedroom, split-level home, the stricken look on her face screamed something was wrong.

""They're rioting in Nashville,"" she said.

Carpenter switched on the news. Reports described ""several hundred Negroes"" roaming the streets, throwing rocks, bricks and bottles at the police officers who were trying to disperse them.

Carmichael was spotted in the clash on Jefferson Street, reports said.

""Almost right after they said that,"" Carpenter recalls, ""Stokely and some Fisk students walked in the door.""

He certainly wasnâ€™t in any mood to have a meeting. ""Let's party,"" he said.

They didn't stay long.

A storm had been stirred.

When passive Nashville disappeared

The next day, on a sleepy Sunday morning, Nashville woke up to a horrifying headline:

Riot flares in Fisk area

For two stifling spring nights, race riots ripped through the city, punctuated by sporadic gunshots, persistent rock-throwing, scattered fires and tear gas.

A Fisk student was shot in the leg. A Tennessee A&amp;I student got a bullet in the neck. Thirty-six were arrested.

""The riots were a coming of age of a new young, black Nashville,"" says Mitchell, who walked to his fatherâ€™s liquor store in north Nashville when the violence escalated in case his family needed him.

â€œIt was an active Nashville. â€¦ The passive, old Nashville disappeared.â€

Police and politicians blamed the riots on Carmichael.

Rep. Harry Lee Senter â€” a Democrat from the town of Bristol in the far east corner of the state â€” stood in front the Tennessee House and proclaimed in a quavering voice that Nashville suffered ""a tragic weekend of treason, anarchy, arson and bloodshed"" because of Carmichael.

He sponsored a resolution asking U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark to have Carmichael â€” a U.S. citizen born in Trinidad â€” deported.

News of the events spread to the coasts. The New York Times ran a front-page story.

Some questioned whether the unrest was stoked by Carmichael's fiery words or by the preceding effort to silence him.

Either way, Impact was in the fray.

The most conservative Vanderbilt board members called for the resignation of the chancellor, the symposium's staunchest supporter.

""We knew we did not want to back down from being provocative, from being relevant, from being a student-run organization that made people think,"" Gaillard says.

In a news release, Gaillard wrote, â€œOur concern is not with controversy. We do not seek it; neither do we fear it.â€

The topic for 1968 would not be surrender, but dissent.

'I dissent from that, and I know you do, too '

At the Impact symposium in March 1968, more than 10,800 people â€” double the student population at Vanderbilt â€” crammed inside Memorial Gymnasium.

They listened to young country crooner George Hamilton IV pick folk ballads on his guitar and waited impatiently for Kennedy's arrival.

It was the largest crowd to attend an Impact symposium.

A two-minute standing ovation greeted Kennedy when he finally walked in.

In front of a massive American flag, he vigorously defended the right to dissent.

""The president tells us we can look forward to summer after summer of riot and repression,"" Kennedy said to the overflow crowd in his magnetizing Massachusetts twang.

""Here in Nashville, as all across the nation, we have seen the tragic and intolerable consequences. I dissent from that, and I know you do, too.""

Carpenter, again, was in Impact's audience.

At Vanderbilt, she had become more conscious of her race, not less. As the city around her worked to overcome its conflict, she, too, persisted.

She saw dissent as a valid means to create change. But she knew dissent, as it had in Nashville, could turn ugly and dangerous.

When Kennedy finished his speech, people pressed in from all sides to shake his hand. The button was torn from his right sleeve, but Kennedy did not stop smiling.

Robert Kennedy Jr. remembers that his father had many enthusiastic supporters, from people living in the ghettos of New York and California to those on Indian reservations and in Hispanic communities.

College students could be particularly intense.

â€œThe college students really inflamed that point in history,â€ Kennedy Jr. says. â€œThey were literally looking down the barrel of a gun. And they were angry.â€

It was a rousing start to the Impact symposium, which was split into two parts in 1968 because of scheduling conflicts.

The second half was set to take place April 5, featuring speakers John V. Lindsay, the mayor of New York, and Nicholas Katzenbach, undersecretary of the United States.

But on April 4, peaceful dissent met a violent end in Memphis.

In Gaillard's off-campus apartment, where the sofa was tattered and the kitchen was filled with dirty dishes, the Impact organizing group members were busy with last-minute preparations.

They were sorting through stacks of papers and making confirmation phone calls when someone ran into the room. â€œKingâ€™s been shot,â€ he shouted.

""It was surreal,"" Gaillard says.

King's appearance at Impact the year before was overshadowed by Carmichael's speech and the riots that followed.

Kingâ€™s death was not.

Hundreds of Vanderbilt University students, led by 40 black student members of the Afro-American club at the school, marched from campus toward downtown.

They attended an interfaith memorial service at St. Maryâ€™s Catholic Church led by clergymen of four faiths â€” a rabbi, a bishop, and two reverends.

Riots again threatened the city, tanks took to the streets, and Impact appeared in jeopardy once more as scheduled speakers began to cancel. First Lindsay. Then Katzenbach.

Nashville instituted a curfew to curb the unrest, but Impact â€” by the grace of city officials â€” went on as planned.

Gaillard remembers the eloquence of Georgia legislator Julian Bond, the passion of muckraker Jack Newfield, the intelligence of influential conservative William F. Buckley.

King's death gave every discussion more depth

""But you had to ask, 'What in the world is going to happen to our country?' ""

Two months later, Kennedy was shot and killed.

A better place

Gaillard says, ""Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, for a lot of us, were the embodiment of hope. They were the champions of the idealism that had begun to take root for that whole decade.

""All of a sudden, their appearances at Impact had a tragic urgency that we never expected â€” or asked for. We were horrified and stricken.

""It was hard to hope after that.""

Recovering has been a generations-long struggle, says Gaillard â€” a writer in residence at the University of South Alabama and an award-winning author who has chronicled the South in eloquent and important ways.

Mitchell says that, just as he saw in 1968, there is a spark of optimism.

""They say every movement needs a martyr,"" Mitchell says. ""In that case, it seems like it was necessary at the time.

""I think Kingâ€™s death, for a while, made America a better place. It reached those who werenâ€™t easily reached. Lessons were learned.

""I think, in Nashville, much progress was made.""

The students of the 1960s are the parents and the grandparents of today. The kids they raise walk out of schools and hold rallies for their own causes.

Gay rights. Women's equality. Gun control.

""We've been waiting for the young people to get fired up,"" Carpenter says, a satisfaction in her voice. ""We've got to pass this baton.""

It is a different fight, driven by the same spirit.

Dissent.

3TKXBROM5USZ7CG9ECPEOBS8JTBJI2,"Esports execs say donâ€™t blame the games, blame U.S. gun laws","Esports organizers say don't blame the games.

Executives at the Asian Games have expressed sympathy for the victims of the deadly shooting at a video game tournament in a Florida shopping mall. But Kenneth Fok, president of the Asian Electronic Sports Federation, said the shooting was more a reflection of U.S. gun laws than the gaming community.

U.S. authorities say 24-year-old David Katz of Baltimore killed two people and wounded nine others before fatally shooting himself Sunday at a Madden tournament being held at a riverfront mall in Jacksonville.

""Of course tragedies like this should never happen. One is already too many,"" Fok told a news conference Wednesday about the introduction of esports at the Asian Games. ""But I think this is a bigger issue of gun control and access to guns.

""This very unfortunate incident happened in a video game arena, but does this mean that it's esports or video games to blame? I don't believe so. It's not esports that caused this. We're really saddened to see this take place.""

While several U.S.-based esports organizers have called for better security at events since Sunday's shooting, Indian Gaming League founder and AESF vice-president Lokesh Suji said problems such as the shooting in Florida hadn't occurred in Asia, where the vast bulk of esports and gaming is focused.

""Tell me about one incident where this has happened in Asia,"" said Suji, adding that drawing comparisons between gaming and violence ""is the wrong perspective.""

""We've never had this in this part of the world. Why are things happening in the U.S.?"" Suji said. ""It's very sad. Every time something like this happens in the U.S., people start blaming the video games. The bigger picture, the bigger problem is gun control.""

Esports made its competitive debut this week as a demonstration sport at the Asian Games, which has attracted more than 11,000 athletes in 40 sports. The arena was packed for the esports debut and the reception was good, leading organizers to be positive about being considered as a medal sport for the next Asian Games in China in 2022 and ultimately at the Olympics.

Fok said the gaming community and the burgeoning industry was paying attention to concerns such as addiction, and believes those can be addressed by education and regulation as competitive gaming edges further into the mainstream.

""It is a high-stress environment. We have to protect athletes as well,"" Fok said. ""As we grow, we have to look at the overall well-being of all our athletes.""

Mike Morhaime, the CEO of Blizzard Entertainment, an American video games developer, told a recent International Olympic Committee forum that esports has 2 billion people worldwide playing electronic games, with 380 million watching esports.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/esports-execs-say-dont-blame-the-games-blame-u-s-gun-laws/,"['Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic']","['3', '5', '4', '4', '5']"
3IQ9O0AYW7HTLFCEQ63IQHFHHY4ITE,Russian spy Mariia Butina and I don't know each other,"Gov. Scott Walker is pictured in 2015 with Alexander Torshin and Maria Butina. Butina was charged in July 2018 with attempting to help Russia interfere with U.S. politics. (Photo: Our American Revival)

APPLETON, Wis. â€“ Gov. Scott Walker said Wednesday he talked only briefly with a woman now accused of being a Russian spy, saying he had his photo taken with her just as he does with others who say they are supporters.

""As we go to events, we meet people, they introduce themselves, often they ask for a picture,"" Walker told reporters during a stop in Appleton. ""And that's not a meeting. A meeting is where you sit down in a room and have a discussion.""

Walker was referring to his interaction with Maria (which is sometimes spelled ""Mariia"") Butina, 29, who was indicted this week for conspiring to interfere with U.S. politics and advance Russian interests. At a hearing Wednesday, a federal magistrate ordered the Russian national, who allegedly infiltrated American political organizations including the National Rifle Association, be held without bond.

Magistrate Deborah Robinson sided with federal prosecutors who argued that Butina represented an â€œextremeâ€ risk of flight from the country.

Walker posed for a photo with Butina at a National Rifle Association meeting in Tennessee in 2015. In the photo, Walker stood between Butina and Alexander Torshin, who is not named in court filings but is the ""Russian official"" who gave Butina orders as part of the conspiracy, according to the New York Times.

At the time of the photo at the NRA event, Walker was preparing to launch his presidential bid. Soon afterward, Butina attended Walker's event announcing his campaign launch.

Walker said he has not been contacted by authorities and knows of no one from his campaign who has been.

Butina said in online posts in 2015 that Walker said ""hello"" and ""thank you"" to her in Russian and that she did not detect any hostility toward Russia from him.

Walker said he did not recall whether he spoke Russian to her, but did take one semester of the language in college.

Asked if he remembered talking to her, Walker said, ""Well, I do now because it's all over the media. But to me, it's just another person we met.""

In a court filing Wednesday, prosecutors alleged Butina was in touch with Russian intelligence operatives and once offered sex to someone in exchange for a position with an unnamed special interest group

An affidavit filed earlier by an FBI agent alleged a ""Russian official"" â€“ Torshin, according to media reports â€“ requested that Butina write a brief report about a political event she was to attend in 2015.

The next day, Butina wrote a report that ""included descriptions of her speaking to a political candidate on the night of the announcement, as well as Butina's previous private meeting with the candidate at the 2015 annual gun rights organization members' meeting.""

It is not clear if that portion of the affidavit is referring to Walker.

Butina, the founder of the gun rights group Right to Bear Arms, frequently posted about guns on social media. She promoted the right to carry weapons in frequent interviews in excellent but heavily accented English.

Saul Anuzis, a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, told the Washington Post she was ""like a novelty"" because running a gun rights group in Russia appeared radical.

Photos of Butina and Torshin with Walker were posted on the website of Our American Revival, a political group set up by Walker leading up to his presidential run. At the time, Walker's team frequently loaded photos onto the group's website of the governor posing with people who attended his events.

""I just ask the logical question. If it was something covert, why would we post that picture on a website?"" Walker said to reporters. ""It just seems ridiculous to think that would be the case.

""The reason we did is because every day we took hundreds of pictures with people who met us at events and then we put them on a website so that people could take them off that website.""

The exchange with Butina and Torshin occurred in a VIP area of the NRA event, according to the Washington Post.

388FBO7JZSBHG2MZXS39363DIZGNYO,Virgin Islands governor's gun-confiscation plan probed by Republicans,"Republican lawmakers are inquiring into an order from U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Kenneth Mapp that theoretically allowed the state to seize citizensâ€™ firearms ahead of Hurricane Irma last year.

Rep. Rob Bishop, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, and Rep. Bob Goodlatte, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, sent Mapp, an independent, a letter Wednesday asking for clarification on an executive order he signed in September 2017 they said is still in effect.

The order, according to the two Republicans, gave the adjutant general the authority â€œto seize arms, ammunition, explosives and incendiary material and other property required.â€

The order also â€œallows for the National Guard to spend government resources to acquire firearms and ammunition outside of normal government procurement processes.â€

Bishop told Fox Newsâ€™ Tucker Carlson the lawmakers want to know if â€œas devastating as those two hurricanes were, if that ever justifies the denial of a civil liberty or the denial of a constitutional right.â€

The U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) is a group of islands in the Caribbean. The islands were devastated by back-to-back hurricanes â€“ Irma and Maria â€“ in September 2017.

â€œJust because there is an emergency â€“ and Iâ€™m not denying, Iâ€™ve been there, I know how devastating that hurricane was for the islands â€“ that still does not justify what this appears to justify,â€ Bishop, from Utah, said.

HURRICANE MARIA WONâ€™T FAZE US VIRGIN ISLANDS RESIDENTS STAYING TO HELP OTHERS IN AFTERMATH

Bishop noted that itâ€™s unclear if any law-abiding citizensâ€™ firearms have been used or confiscated by the USVI government since the order was enacted.

After reauthorizing the order in December, Mapp told The Daily Caller the National Guard â€œis not authorized to take arms and munitions from civilians.â€ He also called questions about the orderâ€™s language â€œfoolish.â€

â€œThe inconsistency between the language in the executive order and Virgin Islands Code allowing for the seizure of legally owned firearms and your public statements regarding how the executive order will be implemented is concerning and potentially jeopardizes citizensâ€™ right to bear arms,â€ Bishop and Goodlatte wrote.

Fact-checking website Snopes said the orderâ€™s language is â€œclearâ€ in that it â€œempowersâ€ the adjutant general of USVIâ€™s National Guard to take guns and â€œcan reasonably be assumed that such confiscation would extend to the property of civilians, especially since there is nothing in the order to contradict this natural assumption, or to stipulate that only property owned by incorporated entities or trusts may be seized.â€

WHERE DOES TRUMP STAND ON GUN CONTROL? A LOOK AT THE PRESIDENTâ€™S VIEWS

The National Rifle Association threatened to sue last year when it announced its â€œstrong oppositionâ€ to the order.

â€œPeople need the ability to protect themselves during times of natural disaster,â€ Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRAâ€™s Institute for Legislative Action, said at the time. â€œThis dangerous order violates the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens and puts their lives at risk.â€

After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans police also rounded up citizens' legally obtained firearms as ordered by then-Mayor Ray Nagin. That led to the passage of the Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act of 2006, which prohibits â€œthe confiscation of firearms during certain national emergencies.â€

HURRICAN IRMA â€˜DEVASTATESâ€™ US VIRGIN ISLANDS BUT THEIR SENSE OF COMMUNITY IS UNWAVERING

â€œCitizens deserve a clear answer on how the government of the Virgin Islands intends to implement this and any future emergency executive orders that may impact their constitutional right to bear arms and defend themselves in an emergency,â€ said Goodlatte and Bishop.

Mappâ€™s office did not immediately respond to Fox Newsâ€™ request for comment Wednesday afternoon.

He says a â€œtest for all of us is comingâ€ and â€œa test for the Supreme Court is coming as well.â€ He says itâ€™s important that the Supreme Court be â€œabove suspicion.â€ He wants Kavanaugh to announce that he will recuse himself from any cases involving Trump. Democrats just keep asking the same question in different ways over and over and over and over and over again.

6:17 PM Sen. T-Bone (D-NJ), who wasted an hour this morning grandstanding, now questioning Kavanaugh. He wants to ask Kavanaugh about documents and asks if he has communicate with Bill Burck after Kennedyâ€™s announcement that he would retire.

4:45: Crapo mentions a CNBC article in which Kasowitz denies anyone at his firm spoke to Kavanaugh about the Mueller investigation. From CNBC:

Marc Kasowitz, a personal attorney for President Donald Trump, threw cold water on Sen. Kamala Harrisâ€™ questioning of Brett Kavanaugh, denying he had any contact with his firm, Kasowitz Benson Torres. â€œThere have been no discussions regarding Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation between Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm,â€ a spokesman for Kasowitz said in a statement first provided to CNBC on Thursday.

4:35 PM: Blumenthal repeatedly asks whether Kavanaugh ever discussed Muellerâ€™s investigation with anyone in the White House or at Kasowitzâ€™s firm. Blumenthal says heâ€™ll take his answer as a no. Heâ€™s now offended by Trumpâ€™s tweets attacking Ginsburg and repeatedly questions Kavanaugh about whether he agrees with Trumpâ€™s insults about Ginsburg.

4:20 PM: Discussion now turns to technology and privacy. Kavanaugh says oneâ€™s privacy is impacted if government gets â€œyour whole lifeâ€ when it gets someoneâ€™s data from a technology company.

4:10 PM: After Kavanaugh introduces some of the girls he has coached throughout the years, Flake talks about his trip to South Africa with Sen. Coons a few months ago. He praises South Africaâ€™s constitutional court that ruled against the sitting president that allowed parliament to remove him. He â€œmarveledâ€ at how South Africa had a court that understood their role and how important it was to be completely independent of the executive. Now he talks about Mugabe. And he discusses limits to executive power like he did yesterday.

3:45 PM: Coons says Kavanaugh is not being honest about his views on the â€œunitary executive theoryâ€ and presidential power because if he were in the age of Trump, it would put his nomination in â€œjeopardy.â€

Kavanaugh says he has reaffirmed Humphreyâ€™s Executor and said Nixon v. U.S. was one of the Courtâ€™s best decisions.

3:25 PM: Coons asks if Nixon violated the law or constitution when he fired Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor. Kavanaugh: â€œIt violated the regulation.â€

3:15 PM: Kavanaugh says dissents speak to the next generation, and thatâ€™s why they are important. They are discussing Justice Harlanâ€™s famed dissent in Plessy.

3:09: Sasse and Kavanaugh discussing precedent and the need for established rules and precedents. They are discussing Kavanaughâ€™s 2016 law review article: The Judge as Umpire: Ten Principles. They are discussing this part of the article:

Second, to be a good judge and a good umpire, you also have to follow the established rules and the established principles. A good umpire should not be making up the strike zone as he or she goes along. Judges likewise should not make up the rules as they go along. We see this in statutory interpretation, for example. A good judge sticks to the established text and canons of construction that help guide us in interpreting ambiguous text. Justice Antontin Scalia has had a profound influence on statutory interpretation. One of the things he has helped to do is to narrow the areas of disagreement about how to interpret statutes. Every judge now seems to start with the text of the statute. If you came to our court and sat in our courtroom for a weekâ€”and I do not advise that for anyone who wants to stay saneâ€”you would hear every judge asking, â€œWhat does the text of the statute say? How does the text of the statute support your position?â€ That has been a big change in statutory interpretation, and it has helped establish better and clearer rules of the road. Following established rules includes stare decisis: we follow the cases that have been decided. We operate in a system built on Supreme Court precedent. As lower court judges, we must adhere to absolute vertical stare decisis, meaning we follow what the Supreme Court says. And to be a good lower court judge, you must follow the Supreme Court precedent in letter and in spirit. We should not try to wriggle out of what the Supreme Court said, or to twist what the Supreme Court said, or to push the law in a particular direction, but to follow what the Supreme Court said in both letter and spirit. Horizontal stare decisis has some flexibility, as it must. Vertical stare decisis is absolute.

3:05: When Sasse asks if the Supreme Court has made any mistakes, Kavanaugh responds with Plessy and Dred Scott.

2:57 PM: Klobuchar says her father has been a journalist for his whole life and she and Kavanaugh discuss New York Times v. Sullivan.

2:46 PM: Klobuchar wants to know if there is a difference between â€œprecedenceâ€ and â€œsettled law.â€ Kavanaugh says he does not want to give a â€œthumbs upâ€ or â€œthumbs downâ€ to potential cases that will come before him. Klobuchar now asking about executive powers. She keeps grilling him on his Minnesota Law Review article re: impeachment and Kavanaugh says Congress has investigative powers and the Constitution specifies impeachment. Klobuchar wants to know if a president should not be subjected to criminal prosecution if a president hypothetically committed murder. Kavanaugh says itâ€™s a â€œtiming questionâ€ and the president can be prosecuted after leaving office.

2:45 PM: Klobuchar wants to discuss campaign finance with Kavanaugh and intends to ask follow-up questions from yesterdayâ€™s questioning re: Buckley v. Valeo. She wants to know if strict scrutiny is the right standard to apply to all campaign finance laws.

Kavanaugh speaks about the divide between contributions and expenditures. (different levels of scrutiny)â€¦ â€œprecedent of the Supreme Court that has been applied since 1976.â€

2:32 PM: Kavanaugh speaks about the importance of textualism in deciding cases in response to a question from Cruz. He also addresses his opinions in which he supported the rights of religious speakers to their rights in the public square. Kavanaugh says he will regularly play basketball on the â€œhighest court in the landâ€â€“the basketball court on top of the Supreme Court. He says Justice Thomas was the last to regularly play but he got injured playingâ€¦ Kavanaugh says he hopes he wonâ€™t follow that precedent.

2:10 PM: Whitehouse questions Kavanaughâ€™s remarks about Clintonâ€™s White House running a presidentially approved â€œsmear campaign.â€ Kavanaugh doesnâ€™t want to talk about current events when Whitehouse continues questioning.

Hereâ€™s what happened: Last night, Senators Leahy, Coons, Blumenthal and Booker requested that certain â€œcommittee confidentialâ€ documents be made public for use during the hearing for Judge Kavanaugh. https://t.co/nAmaAI5sxm â€” Garrett Ventry (@GarrettVentry) September 6, 2018

1:04 PM: Lee asking Kavanaugh about Harrisâ€™ question last night about the Kasowitz firm. He says Harris was a bit â€œominousâ€ when she said Kavanaugh had to â€œbe sureâ€ in his response. Lee says the firm has offices in nine cities and even Kasowitz probably does not know everyone who works in the firm that he founded. They both realized last night that Sen. Lieberman works at the firm and they did not that beforehand. Kavanaugh says he has not made any promises to anyone about how he would rule on cases that could come before him.

12:59 PM: Lee again goes back to Bookerâ€™s question last nightâ€“he asked Kavanaugh questions about emails from 18 years ago that Kavanaugh did not even have in front of him. Lee says that these emails deal with issues concerning affirmative action case Adarand. Lee says Kavanaugh was doing what a good lawyer should do in identifying five Supreme Court Justices who would not accept the governmentâ€™s argument (Department of Transportation) in Adarand and offered a remedy. Lee says that Booker should vote for him.

12:53: Durbin and Kavanaugh go back and forth about whether Kavanaugh was involved in some Bush administration programs re: torture and detention. Durbin keeps trying to make the case that Kavanaugh lied to him in 2006 when Kavanaugh has repeatedly said he was not â€œread intoâ€ those programs.

12:46: Durbin says books are being written about how â€œdemocracy diesâ€ in the age of Trump and he wants reassurances about his views on executive power/importance of democratic institutions in this â€œhistorical context.â€ Kavanaugh says his record shows his commitment to the independent judiciary as the â€œcrown jewelâ€ of the republic. He says a foundational principle is that â€œno one is above the law.â€ Kavanaugh says a court order requiring a president to do or not to do something is the â€œfinal word.â€

12:36: Durbin again makes it about Trump. He says we have to take Kavanaughâ€™s nomination in that context and uses his time to blast Trump for ridiculing the Justice Department and being an â€œun-indicted co-conspirator.â€ He mentions Woodwardâ€™s book and the anonymous NYT article. He wants to know his views on the authority of the president. Says America hasnâ€™t been this riveted by a SCOTUS nomination since Clarence Thomas because of Trumpâ€™s recent actions/statements. He is grilling Kavanaugh on the â€œunitary executiveâ€ theory. He says in the age of Trump, this view of presidential power takes on â€œadded significance.â€ Durbin gets in a line about â€œScalia decisisâ€ when speaking about Republican lawmakers who feel bound by Scaliaâ€™s dissents re: their opposition to the Mueller investigation.

12:32: Durbin now begins his questioning. He thanks Grassley for the fairness he has shown. Durbin again says protesters of the â€œcosts of democracy.â€ He claims he doesnâ€™t know who organized the protests.

11:55 AM: Graham asks Kavanaugh if there is anything written in the Constitution about abortion. Kavanaugh says Supreme Court recognized it in 1973 and it has been â€œreaffirmed many times.â€ He keeps pressing Kavanaugh about whether there is any phrase in the Constitution about abortion. Graham says â€œliberty doesnâ€™t equate to abortionâ€ after Kavanaugh speaks about the liberty clause. Graham wants to know what are the limits on the court re: finding â€œpenumbra of rights,â€ etc. He then questions Kavanaugh about whether terrorists will be incentivized to recruit American citizens if Americans canâ€™t be held as â€œenemy combatants.â€

11:48 AM: Graham says circuses are entertaining and you can take children to them. He says these hearings are neither entertaining nor appropriate for children. Graham blast Democrats for playing games and accusing Kavanaugh of stealing emails, etc. and flipping legal concepts upside down. He urges Democrats just to vote no.

11:47 AM:

As she entered the hearing room, Sen. Kamala Harris didnâ€™t provide more details about why she questioned Kavanaugh about a conversation he may have had with a Kasowitz lawyer on Mueller probe.

â€œI have a good reason to believe there was a conversation,â€ Harris said to us. â€” Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 6, 2018

Asked what she was basing it off of, she said: â€Information that Iâ€™ve received thatâ€™s pretty reliable and I asked him a clear question and he couldnâ€™t give a clear answer.â€ Has she seen any documentation of this? â€œI canâ€™t give you more than that.â€ â€” Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 6, 2018

11:46 AM: Kavanaugh says he will not comment on a potential case when Leahy asks about whether a gun made by a 3-D printer could be regulated.

11:32 AM: Leahy keeps trying to establish, getting frustrated more and more, that Kavanaugh was not truthful about the â€œstolenâ€ emails.

11:27 AM: Hirono releases confidential documents as well:

These are the docs Rs don't want you to seeâ€”because they show that Judge Kavanaugh wrongly believes that Native Hawaiian programs are Constitutionally questionable. I defy anyone reading this to be able to conclude that it should be deemed confidential in any way, shape, or form. pic.twitter.com/yj31vDNGia â€” Senator Mazie Hirono (@maziehirono) September 6, 2018

11:26 AM: Leahy begins by accusing Kavanaugh of receiving â€œstolen materialâ€ from Manny Miranda. â€œDigital Watergate,â€ Leahy says again, continuing his line of questioning from yesterday.

11:17 AM: Kavanaugh says he was talking about what various legal scholars could think on Roe when Hatch gives Kavanaugh an opportunity to address Feinsteinâ€™s previous questions re: previously confidential email.

11:16 AM: Kavanaugh says the warrant requirement ensures that the executive branch cannot invade someoneâ€™s liberty without probable cause.

11:13 AM: Kavanaugh says the judgeâ€™s jobs is to focus on the words of the statute passed by Congress when Hatch asks him about interpreting laws to cover situations that those who wrote the law could not have foreseen. Speaks about liberty vs. security issues becoming more important in the future.

11:11 AM: Kavanaugh says he has not had any â€œinappropriate conversationsâ€ with anyone about the Mueller investigation when Hatch gives him a chance to respond to Harrisâ€™ line of questioning from last night.

11: 10 AM: Booker releases confidential documents:

These are the 4 documents marked committee confidential that I brought up in my questioning of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last night â€“&gt; https://t.co/2RZkY2FS9a â€” Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) September 6, 2018

11:05 AM: Hatch commends Kavanaugh for his level-headedness. Hatch says he has never seen the types of interruptions and accuses the left of trying to turn this in to a â€œcircus.â€ He worries about precedent this could set. He blasts left for its â€œmob mentalityâ€ and the â€œsickâ€ leftists for attacking Kavanaughâ€™s allies who are attending the hearing.

11:03 AM: Feinstein now grilling Kavanaugh about Enron and how the fraud and market manipulation contributed to CAâ€™s energy crisis. She asks Kavanaugh about talking points he wrote about whether it was up to FERC to stop such conduct. Kavanaugh says FERC would have a role but he is not sure if it should have primary responsibility. Says he was not an expert in those type of cases at the time.

10:58 AM: Feinstein now asking Kavanaugh about the Sea World case in which a killer whale killed a trainer. Kavanaugh says he follows precedent when he ruled that the Labor Department did not have the authority to regulate employers in sporting/entertainment. He says state tort law (NFL concussions) exists to ensure safety. Says he pointed out Labor Dept. could change precedent or Congress could act but he was following precedentâ€“Dept. traditionally not been thought of as proper body to prohibit punt returns or mandate ear flaps on helmets, etc.

10:55 AM: Feinstein says, â€œWe have a president who said he could authorize worse than waterboarding. How would you feel about that?â€ Kavanaugh says he will not comment. Feinstein asks Kavanaugh if Bushâ€™s post-9/11 policies re: interrogations were legal. Kavanaugh talks about the need to give sound legal advice and â€œbackboneâ€ but also says itâ€™s important for lawyers to tell a president â€œno.â€

10:53 AM: Kavanaugh mentions that George W. Bush was a pro-life president and says his job was to assist him on policies related to that so some things may have crossed his desk. Feinstein said the Bush White House took steps to limit abortions.

10:43 AM: Feinstein starts off by going back to Roe. She says she now has a previously confidential document that is now public.

She asks if he believes Roe is settled law and if he believes it is correctly settled.

Kavanaugh, like he said yesterday, says Roe is an â€œimportant precedentâ€ that has been â€œreaffirmed many times.â€ Speaks about â€œprecedent on precedentâ€ like he did yesterday.

10:41 AM: Grassley now asking Kavanaugh, like Kennedy did last night, about keeping an open mind about cameras in the courtroom. He again says he may be more open to allowing cameras for the announcement of decisions than for oral arguments.

10:35 AM: Grassley finally begins his 20 minutes of questioning and says it is wrong to frame Kavanaugh as someone who does not rule for the â€œlittle guy.â€ He says Kavanaugh applies the law fairly to all. Agitator interrupts. Grassley gives Kavanaugh to discuss a case in which he rule for a woman who was denied Social Security benefits (â€œhall of mirrors for the woman). He reversed the denial for the woman with mental illness.

10:30 AM: Tillis, who has successfully thrown many jabs at Booker during his remarks, says it took him 17 years to get his college degree after attending five schools, none of which will be elevated to the Ivy League. He says he is not planning to run for president in 2020 or ever. He suggests Senators waive their rights to their documents and suggests they release all of the emails relating to the confirmation process.

10:22 AM: Grassley recognizes Booker and hopes that Booker wonâ€™t keep saying the same thing. Booker said he violated the rules so the public can know Kavanaughâ€™s views on the race. Booker says this is the closest he will have to an â€œI am Spartacus moment.â€ Booker proud that he has violated the rules and keeps mentioning how he knowingly â€œviolated the rulesâ€ over and over again.

10:20 AM: Coons arguing that the documents belong to the American people.

10:18 AM: Lee says if Democrats are frustrated, then they should review the Presidential Records Act.

â€œThese documents are not ours,â€ Lee says, adding the public is not entitled to documents that do not belong to them as Democrats have been trying to argue. â€œThey belong to someone else.â€

Lee says he understands that Democrats want to look for a â€œdemonâ€ and says, in this case, â€œthe demon is a law of our own creationâ€“the Presidential Records Act.â€

10:07 AM: Sen. Durbin (D-IL) says, like Sen. Whitehouse (D-RI), his silence should not be interpreted as consent. Durbin spoke after Feinstein said the public is entitled to all of the documents. Durbin claims Bill Burck doesnâ€™t have the authority to determine which documents should be marked â€œclassified.â€ He then blasts Cornyn for saying Bookerâ€™s conduct was â€œunbecoming of a Senator.â€

10:02 AM: Sen. Lee (R-UT), who first called out Booker last night and said Kavanaugh is entitled to see the emails he was being questioned about, says the process is not rigged and has worked.

9:57 AM: Sen. Kennedy (R-LA) says he was trying to be fair to Kavanaugh last night after Booker ambushed him with questions about an email that Kavanaugh did not have a copy of and he says he was trying to be fair to both sides. Sen. Blumenthal (D-CT) now using his time to mention Bob Woodwardâ€™s book and the New York Times anonymous op-ed to say the breakdown of the process on the Committee is reflective of the chaos in other parts of the government.

9:50 AM: Booker says he will violate rulesâ€“penalty is potential ouster from the Senateâ€“in an act of â€œcivil disobedienceâ€ and release one of the confidential emails about racial profiling.

â€œI understand the consequences of civil disobedience,â€ Booker said, admitting that he is â€œknowingly violatingâ€ the rules of the Senate.

Sen. Cory Booker says he is willing to risk ouster from Senate for releasing documents: ""If Sen. Cornyn believes I violated Senate rules, I openly invite and accept the consequences of my team releasing that email right now."" https://t.co/JUkIdZ4RJ2 pic.twitter.com/kSH16guTzV â€” CBS News (@CBSNews) September 6, 2018

Cornyn tells Booker that â€œrunning for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,â€ and says what Booker is doingâ€“flouting the Senate rules to release classified emailsâ€“is like releasing classified information.

â€œConduct unbecoming of a Senator,â€ Cornyn adds.

""Running for President is not a reason to release classified information""

9:42 AM: Booker now speaking about the â€œabsurdityâ€ of the process re: documents. Yesterday, Booker claimed the system was â€œrigged.â€ He now says the process â€œis a bit of sham.â€ Grassley asks â€œwas it a sham when we did it for Gorsuch?â€ He asks if it was a sham when Sen. Leahy did it?

9:40 AM: Grassley suggests Democrats all along wanted to play politics with documents. Like Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) did last night, he takes issue with Booker and Democrats for using confidential emails in their questioning.

9:35 AM: Grassley says that even Sen. Feinstein (D-CA) conceded that Kavanaugh was â€œforthcomingâ€ in his answers. Feinsteinâ€™s left-wing challenger Kevin de Leon was less than thrilled:

The protesters at the #KavanaughConfirmation are patriots trying to protect the rights of every American threatened by this nominee.

9:25 AM: Senators now entering the room as the third day of hearings is about to begin. Looks like there will be more protesters. But in a strange way, the protesters have helped Kavanaugh go relatively unscathed. They often interrupt when Democrats on the Committee are trying to build momentum, essentially giving Kavanaugh what can be considered numerous 20-second timeouts to regroup. The agitators have also made the left look terrible to regular Americans.",https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/09/06/live-updates-scotus-confirmation-hearings-brett-kavanaugh-faces-final-round-of-questions/,"['Republican', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic']","['1', '1', '3', '1', '2']"
3BJKPTD2QDU6EEFXGTXR49G84PZTRV,Hadiya Pendleton: Man found guilty of murder in shooting death of teen who performed at Obama inauguration,"A jury has found a suspected gang member guilty of murder in the death of a 15-year-old honor student who had just returned to Chicago from performing at then-President Barack Obama's second inauguration in 2013. Micheail Ward, 18 at the time, was found guilty Thursday of firing the fatal shot that struck Hadiya Pendleton.

A separate jury had found Kenneth Williams, the man accused of driving the getaway car, guilty on Wednesday of first-degree murder.

Ward testified that he was ordered to fire on a group of young people, including Pendleton, whom he believed were members of a rival gang.

According to prosecutors, Ward shot and killed Pendleton in January 2013 at Harsh Park as she and a group of friends were taking cover from the rain. He and Williams mistook them for rival gang members. Police and prosecutors have said the shooting was retaliation for a gang shooting that left Williams wounded six months earlier, CBS Chicago reports.

Prosecutors wrapped up their case against Ward on Wednesday by showing his jury several hours of his videotaped interrogation, which ended with him tearfully admitting to shooting Pendleton and two of her friends.

""I didn't want to do that s***, man. I liked that girl,"" Ward told detectives.

Ward later recanted, and his defense attorneys have argued detectives coerced and manipulated Ward into a false confession. Defense attorneys also argued there is no physical evidence linking either Ward or Williams to the crime.

Pendleton's death came to symbolize gun violence in Chicago because of the girl's own history and her connection to the president of the United States and the first lady.

3IVKZBIBJ1RSAKOFVOG7G0IGFBNHSP,Anger over Ed Dept mulling federal money for guns in schools,"WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Education Department said Thursday that it is weighing whether to allow states to use federal funds to purchase guns for schools, prompting a storm of criticism from Democratic lawmakers and educators.

If approved, the plan would likely generate a lot of controversy at a time when a string of especially deadly school shootings earlier this year led to the rise of a powerful student-led gun control movement.

A senior Trump administration official told The Associated Press on Thursday that the agency is reviewing legislation governing federal academic enrichment grants to see if the money can be used to procure firearms.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, said the bipartisan Every Student Success Act, passed in 2015, does not expressly prohibit or allow the use of Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants for the purchase of firearms. The official said the agency received several letters asking it to clarify what those funds could be used for and began researching the issue.

DeVos, who chairs a federal commission on school safety, has previously said that schools should have the option to arm teachers. The commission, formed in the aftermath of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people, has been criticized for omitting the topic of gun control.

The plan, first reported by The New York Times, prompted swift condemnation from Democratic lawmakers and many educators on Thursday, who accused the Trump administration of wanting to deprive students of much-needed mental health support and other resources in the interests of the National Rifle Association.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the idea â€œone of the most egregious, short-sighted and dangerous executive branch abuses of our education system in modern history.â€

â€œSecretary DeVos continues to lead an anti-student and anti-teacher campaign on behalf of special interests and the NRA that rejects proven and effective initiatives to ensure a safe, welcoming school climate for children.â€

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, which was the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting, swiftly introduced an amendment that would block the Education Department from using the funds to arm schools.

â€œThe Secretary of Education cares more about the firearms industryâ€™s bottom line than the safety of our kids, and that should scare parents to death,â€ he said.

Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, accused DeVos of trying â€œto do the bidding of the National Rifle Association and gun manufacturers.â€

â€œInstead of after-school programs or counselors, programs that are critical for creating safe and welcoming schools and addressing the mental health needs of kids, DeVos wants to turn schools into armed fortresses and make kids and educators less safe,â€ Weingarten said in a statement.

â€œShe wants to turn the U.S. government into an arms dealer for schools. Thatâ€™s insane,â€ she added.

Martin West, associate professor of education at Harvard University, expressed skepticism.

â€œIt seems very hard to imagine that members of Congress drafting Title IV envisioned that the funds would be used to arm teachers,â€ West said.",https://www.breitbart.com/news/anger-over-ed-dept-mulling-federal-money-for-guns-in-schools/,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['1', '5', '5', '5', '5']"

3LOJFQ4BOYXDAL654JOFYTC86G5DK1,Sex and schmoozing are Russian spy tactics. Publicity makes Maria Butina different,"CLOSE Alleged Russian spy Maria Butina offered sexual favors, wove elaborate backstories, and schmoozed with political operatives. And as it turns out, sheâ€™s only the most recent in a long line. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY

Russian spy tactics are aggressive but, to those who know them, familiar.

Offering sex for favors, schmoozing with political operatives, cultivating an elaborate backstory, using a fake name to mask Russian roots â€“ these are standard aspects of Russian espionage. They typically assume roles as professors, students, business owners â€“ anything that lets them gain information but not draw attention.

That's why accused Russian spy Maria Butina, 29, an unapologetically Russian gun-rights activist who gravitated toward publicity and the National Rifle Association, baffles some ex-intelligence officials with decades working counterintelligence for the FBI and CIA.

Butina faces a federal charge of conspiracy over the allegation she worked for Russia without informing the U.S. government, and a conviction could result in a five-year prison sentence. Her July 15 arrest came more than three years after the FBI claims she began her mission.

Butina pleaded not guilty, and her attorney, Bob Driscoll, maintains she committed no crime. Butina is currently in a Virginia jail. Her next court date is Sept. 10.

The four ex-intelligence officials who spoke to USA TODAY worked and oversaw countless Russian espionage investigations at home and abroad with careers dating to the 1960s through the modern day.

They analyzed Butinaâ€™s case using public information on the alleged spy operation and their institutional knowledge. They describe her as a variation of a â€œspotter,â€ a person who makes connections in the U.S. and passes information to more senior Russian espionage officials. Her â€œinfluenceâ€ campaign, they said, sought grassroots goodwill toward Russia.

But she was not working in the shadows. Butina gave interviews and speeches, published articles and posed for magazine photos.

â€œThat does not fit any spy that I can think of,â€ said Jack Devine, who ran all CIA operations worldwide in the mid-1990s, met with high-level KGB officers and served as the agency's acting and associate deputy director.

It's unclear if Butina's public image was a tactic, opportunity or mishap. Some officials suggest Butina recycled an old Russian routine: target the presidential administration through an affiliated political group â€“ no matter who resides in the White House.

â€œ(Trump) and his administration are the target and groups that are related to the administration, or seek to influence the administration, are the means"" to get access and information, said retired FBI special agent Ed Shaw, who worked several Russian espionage cases abroad during his career from 1989 to 2014. â€œTheyâ€™re following the bread crumbs.â€

If this is the case, the NRA made for a rich target of potential sources. Trump is an enthusiastic supporter of the organization. The NRA and other gun-rights organizations spent $55 million during the 2016 election. The NRA used $31 million in advertising money to back Trump.

Butina built a persona ripe for the NRA as the leader of her own Russian gun-rights group ""The Right to Bear Arms."" She attended NRA events, developed a relationship with NRA leadership and went to member meetings, including one where she met with a political candidate.

Gov. Scott Walker: I don't know accused Russian spy Maria Butina

Butina tagged the NRA as the need-to-know group well before the 2016 election, calling a GOP victory early.

In March 2015, the indictment states, she emailed her diplomatic goals to an American, who was not named but matches the description of GOP fixer Paul Erickson, 56. In the message, she describes how Republicans â€œwould likely obtain control over the U.S. government after the 2016 electionsâ€ and pegs the NRA as a place of conservative influence.

Butinaâ€™s goal to build a backchannel communication line between Russia and the U.S. appeared to show some success. Erickson provided contacts while a Russian official directed her.

She met Republican leaders, organized dinners in Washington, D.C., and attended two National Prayer Breakfasts, an annual D.C. event usually attended by the sitting president.

She'd gained access â€“ and in the spy game, access rules.

â€œShe was doing pretty well making pretty rapid progress and, in some respects, may have been doing too well too soon because her profile on the radar screen raised up too high,â€ Shaw said. â€œBut that shows in some respects sheâ€™s a natural at engaging with people â€” figuring out who the movers and shakers are.â€

""Ghost stories""

Butinaâ€™s case reminds ex-officials of a 2010 case in which federal authorities outed, arrested and expelled from the U.S. 10 Russian spies with fake names and years-long backstories.

The program, named ""Operation Ghost Stories,"" aimed to â€œsearch and develop ties in policymaking circlesâ€ and send intelligence reports to Moscow, according to a federal indictment. It involved Hollywood-level spy tactics, such as burying payments underground, sending encrypted messages on images and seamless cash hand-offs in train stations.

In that case, a couple working as spies targeted then-President Barack Obamaâ€™s young administration and his Cabinet. Just weeks into Obamaâ€™s first term, Moscow instructed Vladimir and Lydia Guryev â€“ who were living in the U.S. under the aliases Richard and Cynthia Murphy â€“ to gather information on U.S. international policy positions ahead of an Obama trip to Russia. The Murphys used fake birth certificates to back up their identities.

â€œThe Russians were heavily targeting the Democrats because they were in power,â€ said Eric Oâ€™Neill, a former FBI undercover operative from 1996 to 2001 who tracked numerous Russian spies in Washington, D.C., in hopes to uncover their information sources. â€œThey were trying to understand the policy decisions of the political party that is in power at that time and to hopefully influence them.â€

Butina's efforts with Republicans were less subtle. She used Twitter, Facebook and Instagram in Russian. She spoke with a thick Russian accent and even earned her own article in Russian GQ.

She also took opportunities to overtly connect Russia with the GOP. In 2015, a column she wrote for the foreign policy magazine The National Interest begins, ""It may take the election of a Republican to the White House in 2016 to improve relations between the Russian Federation and the United States.""

â€œTheyâ€™re trying to manage the perception of Russia in the United States,â€ said retired FBI special agent David Gomez, who worked a number of Russian espionage cases during his career from 1984 to 2011. â€œThey were trying to make friends of Russia.â€

Shun the sex â€˜honey trapâ€™

Butina burrowed into NRA and Republican spheres through Erickson, a South Dakotan with a spotty career in GOP politics.

The two met in Moscow in 2013 when Butina was leading â€œThe Right to Bear Arms."" Erickson reviewed her diplomatic goals and lent her contacts, according to the indictment. The couple later dated, lived together and started a company.

A 2006 photo of Paul Erickson (Photo: Argus Leader archives)

The U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office defined Butina's relationship with Erickson as â€œduplicitous,â€ claiming Butina used it for her spy effort. Prosecutors also allege Butina offered sex with another person in exchange for a job with a special interest group.

Driscoll denied Butina offered sex for a job, calling the allegation a ""sexist smear"" meant to paint Butina ""as some kind of James Bond spy character."" Driscoll confirmed Butina and Erickson were indeed ""an item,"" but any allegation she used him is ""unsupported.""

Either way, the allegation hints at an understood fact in the spy world: Sex is a well-worked method of coercion and blackmail. The Russians, in particular, are known for this, and FBI agents are trained to sidestep such â€œhoney traps.â€

July 25: Maria Butina's lawyer rejects claim she tried to trade sex for a job

Opinion: Maria Butina is the 'spy' the Trump administration asked for

â€œThe women are the most dangerous,â€ said O'Neill, who helped take down his boss Robert Hanssen, an FBI agent who was ultimately exposed as a Russian spy. â€œPart of that is because men are just way more susceptible to an attractive woman. Thatâ€™s just the way it is.â€

Sex can be used a few ways: for coercion, blackmail or as a way to get someone to divulge something they shouldnâ€™t. The gathered intel may provide insight on a targetâ€™s exploitable weaknesses â€“ a debt or affair, for example.

Relationships can be used similarly. Clayton Lonetree, a U.S. Marine who fell for a female KGB agent in the 1980s, ended up selling government documents to the Russian government.

â€œIf you can have a dinner with someone who knows important policy decisions, and youâ€™re an attractive woman, and that person feels flattered at the attention youâ€™re laying on them, they might slip and saying something,â€ said Oâ€™Neill, national security strategist for cybersecurity company Carbon Black.

Butina's 'new fame'

Among the more memorable spies nabbed in the 2010 spy case is Anna Chapman, who posed as the founder of the website nycrentals.com in New York City. The case revealed that Chapman covertly passed information to other Russians using closed internet connections, often at New York City coffee shops and bookstores. After her arrest, Chapman, who ultimately returned to Russia in a prisoner swap, became a model, media personality and celebrity in her home country.

O'Neill sees similarities between Butina and Chapman. Butina's own Russian contact made the same comparison.

â€œHow are you faring there in the rays of the new fame?â€ the Russian official wrote to Butina in 2017. â€œAre your admirers asking for your autographs yet? You have upstaged Anna Chapman.â€

The Russian official, described in the indictment only as a former member of the Russian legislature and a top official at the Russian Central Bank, fits the description of Russian politician Alexander Torshin.

The message came after a number of media articles mentioned Butina, whose prominence in American media bucks the norm for a Russian spy, the ex-officials agreed.

â€œUnlike Chapman and the rest of them, she comes over here as a Russian,â€ O'Neill said. â€œSheâ€™s hiding in plain sight. Thatâ€™s very bold.â€

Butina resided in the U.S. just a few months before the American press caught wind of her. In December 2017, her and Erickson's attempts to make connections with the Trump campaign and the NRA were reported by The New York Times.

Part of what differentiates Butina, Devine said, is how she blended covert political action, like cozying up to the NRA, and espionage, or gathering intelligence to send to Russia.

Driscoll said Butina simply wanted to be a member of the NRA.

""I don't think there's much evidence she did anything covert,"" he said. ""She ran a Russian gun-rights group, so she joined the NRA to help get ideas for that.""

While the ex-officials all agree that a public and prominent spy is unusual, they differ over whether that was by design or whether Butina's plan went awry.

This Friday, Aug. 17, 2018 photo provided by the Alexandria, Va., Detention Center shows Maria Butina, accused of being a Russian spy. (Photo: AP)

Oâ€™Neill suggested Butina's cover was the outward persona â€“ an idea so brash it wouldnâ€™t draw suspicion. There's also the belief she possessed a genuine interest in gun rights and the Russian government used her to its advantage. Shaw credits her inexperience.

â€œShe could have been unwitting in that sense,â€ he said. â€œShe could have gone rogue or things could have just gotten away from her.â€

There are more spies out there

Butinaâ€™s specific goal, even to the ex-officials, is unclear.

â€œThe long-term objective may have been something completely unrelated to the NRA or guns,â€ said Gomez, a retired FBI agent.

But her case â€“ and the Russian election meddling â€“ is evidence the Russians have grown bolder in their spy efforts, said Devine, the ex-CIA official, who over a 32-year career led the effort to drive the Russians out of Afghanistan. He suggests Americans have let their guard down.

â€œThereâ€™s a view in Russia, as demonstrated by the intervention in the election, that you can get away with this stuff today where you couldnâ€™t get away with it in the past,â€ he said. â€œThe level of threat is much different, itâ€™s not just meddling in the election, itâ€™s out there collecting sources of information.â€

Devine hinted the Russian election meddling should have driven home the point the Russians are a real threat â€“ still.

â€œThe emphasis is on collusion and the political piece,â€ he said. â€œWe donâ€™t have enough focus on the fact this is a big intelligence initiative, and it lays bare how aggressive they are.â€

Many of the officials agree other Russian espionage efforts are operating on U.S. soil. Shaw estimates the number of Russian spies in the U.S. could be somewhere between 10 and 20. While cyber warfare proved useful during the 2016 election, on-the-ground spying remains the most effective, and people, he said, ought to â€œabsolutelyâ€ be fearful.

â€œWhere (Russians) used to use people to spread disinformation, now theyâ€™re using social media and different electronic means to do the same things,â€ Oâ€™Neill said. â€œBut the old ways still work.â€

Florida cops who stayed outside Stoneman Douglas will live with their choices. They don't need judgments from a spineless peanut gallery.

I am a full-time law enforcement instructor teaching basic students as well as experienced officers in advanced training programs. Before this position, I was a sworn law enforcement officer. I have been in the law enforcement field for 10 years. In my career, I have responded to shots-fired calls and have been involved in shots-fired incidents. I have walked alone at night in pursuit of drug smugglers. I have responded and assisted county and state police officers on emergency calls ranging from high-speed pursuits with violent felons, to burglaries and assaults in progress, to violent domestic assaults. On some of these calls, I was by myself and the first on scene. I have attended multiple active shooter training programs. Luckily, I have never needed to fire my pistol or long arm at another human being. There is my career disclaimer.

I write this amid reports that the school resource officer in Parkland, Fla., failed to immediately enter Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and engage the shooter or shooters. He reportedly stayed outside for four minutes and never went inside the school while the shooting was going on. And now there are reports that up to four deputies were there and did not enter the school immediately.

A famous verse comes to mind, â€œLet him who is without sin cast the first stone.â€

For all of the knowledgeable news commentators and politicians whom I have heard speaking about this, do you have similar past experiences? For all of my law enforcement colleagues and the politiciansopenly criticizing this deputy and calling him a â€œcoward,â€ have you personally entered an active shooter situation during your career and made the split second decision, alone, to enter a school with only a pistol to confront an active shooter or shooters with rifles? Did you learn like I did, and teach trainees like I do, that you never go into a rifle fight with a pistol, only with equal or superior weaponry when possible?

This, of course, is the opposite of what we teach cops for an active shooter situation. According to current training curriculum, we go in immediately to neutralize the threat and minimize the loss of innocent life. Please fill me in so I make sure that I am not missing anything. Because, unlike all of you, Iâ€™d prefer not to disparage your words or your actions before I have the facts and before Iâ€™ve experienced a similar situation.

For all of the commentators and politicians to so easily refer to this man as a coward is sickening and should be condemned in the strongest terms. Maybe we should change the famous verse to, â€œLet him who has never been shot at criticize those making $40,000 a year who also choose not to be shot at.â€

I ask all of these â€œcourageousâ€ commentators and politicians to place themselves in this officerâ€™s shoes. Do you know how you would react when the rounds start flying near you? Have all of you been in a building while real shots are being fired at you? I have not, so please fill me in. Do you know how that incredible sound affects your brain and your body? Have you been trained in any way to understand the physiological effects on the human body during and after a shooting incident? Have you felt your heart pound out of your chest while someone is killing people around you, with a weapon that you canâ€™t possibly match in fire power?

Of course, the answer to all of these questions is no. And to all of those officers who speak as if they wouldnâ€™t hesitate in a similar situation, and so flippantly dismiss this manâ€™s actions, you better have the applicable warrior credentials.

This man is going to have to live with the decision he made. A lot of people, mostly children, died a terrible death, and this deputy will probably be deemed responsible for some of the tragic results of that day.

Iâ€™d like to think that I would have radioed for assistance, unholstered my pistol, and charged in like the gladiator I think I am. I know how I responded in my previous calls, and Iâ€™m proud of my actions. Iâ€™ve seen other colleagues freeze up under extreme stress and not be able to perform. You donâ€™t know until you are in that position, and the job isnâ€™t for everyone. And once you find that out, and hopefully you do before a mass shooting at a school, you should resign. But there is no reset on my life or re-spawning like a video game.

Often, we still end up charging in like the post-Columbine training teaches us. Effective and ongoing training teaches your mind and body to react more and think less.

Just like all of these children and teachers had families, so did this man. Let him live with his decision without hearing about it from the unqualified and spineless peanut gallery.

The hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts is not qualified at all to comment on President Trumpâ€™s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to be an associate justice on the Supreme Court. Iâ€™m a political scientist, not a lawyer, no matter what Raw Story says.

As a political scientist, however, it is impossible not to notice the role the Federalist Society played in Trumpâ€™s selection of Kavanaugh. And it isnâ€™t just him: This conservative legal organization has played an outsized role in all of Trumpâ€™s judicial appointments (though it might not want the credit for some of them).

David Brooks wrote about this earlier in the week for the New York Times:

Kavanaugh is the product of a community. He is the product of a conservative legal infrastructure that develops ideas, recruits talent, links rising stars, nurtures genius, molds and launches judicial nominees. It almost doesnâ€™t matter which Republican is president. The conservative legal infrastructure is the entity driving the whole project. It almost doesnâ€™t even matter if Kavanaugh is confirmed or shot down; there are dozens more who can fill the vacancy, just as smart and just as conservativeâ€¦. The conservative legal establishment is fully mature. Trump bucked the conservative foreign policy establishment and the conservative economic establishment, but heâ€™s given the conservative legal establishment more power than ever before, which is why there are so few never-Trumpers in legal circlesâ€¦. Itâ€™s a lesson for everybody. If you emphasize professional excellence first, if you gain a foothold in societyâ€™s mainstream institutions, if you build a cohesive band of brothers and sisters, you can transform the landscape of your field.

Thereâ€™s a slight tension within Brooksâ€™s column, however, and it comes through in that excerpt. The Federalist Society has clearly disciplined this most undisciplined of presidents. But conservative foreign policy analysts possess similarly stellar CVs. They created the John Hay Initiative precisely to act as a reservoir of expertise for GOP presidents. But as Jacob Levy noted, â€œThe disciplinary divide among academics here is strong. Conservative and libertarian law professors sound very different from conservative and libertarian political scientists.â€ Why, then, have conservative foreign policy analysts exerted less influence? Why are GOP lawyers the one group thatâ€™s retained its influence?

The best person to answer this might be Steven Teles, author of â€œThe Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement.â€ Fortunately for me, Iâ€™m a faster writer, so I can offer my provisional answer here and then let Teles clean up the mess.

The obvious place to start is to note that GOP foreign policy analysts have exerted influence in the past, and tried to exert influence during the 2016 campaign. In previous elections, most leading GOP candidates would draw from the GOP foreign policy bench, whether it was the Vulcans or not. Even early in the 2016 campaign, this group mattered, as questions about Scott Walkerâ€™s grasp of foreign policy hurt him in the early stages.

Then came Trump, and the GOP foreign policy community responded by saying, in essence, â€œhell no.â€ Multiple petitions were published, declaring â€œMr. Trumpâ€™s own statements lead us to conclude that as president, he would use the authority of his office to act in ways that make America less safe, and which would diminish our standing in the world.â€ It was not surprising that Trump reciprocated that rejection by not hiring anyone who signed those petitions.

Still, this only raises the question of why those petitions had such minimal effects, whereas Trump was quite solicitous of the Federalist Society throughout the campaign and his presidency. And I think the answer here is a variation of an argument I have made repeatedly in the past. The Federalist Society matters because a large segment of GOP voters care way more about the Supreme Court than they do about foreign policy.

This is not to say that foreign policy and national security are unimportant issues. Polls in 2016 suggest this is not the case. Rather, GOP voters who care about issues ranging from abortion to deregulation to gun control care about the court. The Federalist Society represents a powerful elite cue for those constituencies. While it is believable that there are single-issue voters who care about the court, the only single-issue voter who cares about foreign policy is, um, me.

Brooks is correct to note some of the reasons the Federalist Society has thrived even during the death of expertise. But I think the real reason Trump cares what it thinks isnâ€™t about expertise. Itâ€™s that he cannot afford to alienate social conservatives because there are a lot of them. Outside the Beltway, there are not that many national security conservatives.

So thatâ€™s my explanation. But I will be curious to see what others think about this.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/07/12/why-are-gop-lawyers-different/,"['Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Republican', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Republican']","['4', '1', '1', '2', '2']"

Ballistic hard plates could be added for higher levels of protection.

The company is reportedly scaling up production to keep up with demand from parents in the U.S. who are worried about their childrenâ€™s safety as the new school year begins.

â€œIn two months we have sold hundreds and are gearing up to increase production rates to 500 units per month,â€ chief executive Snir Koren told the AFP news agency.

The backpack is suitable for older teenagers, according to the Independent, due to its weight. But the Israeli firm is looking into developing a backpack for younger students.

U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has recently said that any decisions about arming teachers should be made by states and local districts.

Compared to most countries, Americans are much more likely to die from gun violence. According to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive, there have been 238 mass shootings so far in 2018 and a total of 9,837 gun deaths.

According to the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which compiles data on lives lost globally each year, the U.S. had 3.85 gun deaths per 100,000 people in 2016, the 31st highest rate in the world; in the U.K., that figure was 0.07, in Japan, it was 0.04, and in Germany it was 0.12.

The HuffPost asked the liberal icon about the project in an email interview. Moore's title of the film is a play on words of his prior film about George W. Bush called ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""

In the interview, Moore claims his film exposes what he calls the ""evil genius"" of Trump.

""How did this happen?"" is the question that opens the first trailer for the film, which is set to open in theaters Sept. 21. Then the words ""Can't take the insanity anymore?"" appear in big, bold letters.

Scenes from the trailer include Moore speaking to Parkland, Florida, student and gun control activist David Hogg, as well as rising Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

In another scene, dirty water from Flint, Michigan, is being sprayed into the front yard of Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder.

Republican political consultant Roger Stone also appears in the trailer, saying any attempts to impeach Trump will be met with ""a spasm of violence in this country.""

In the HuffPost interview, Moore claims that an insurgency is the works.

""The revolution is happening in the most unlikely of places,"" he said. ""The resistance -- the true resistance -- is not coming from the Democratic Party or from the liberal establishment. I can't reveal too much right now, but there is a real insurgency taking place. I don't know if it will succeed or not. It might be too late.""

Asked if he sees any hope, Moore replied: F*** hope. Seriously, f*** hope. F*** despair, too. But f*** hope.""

Hope is passive and what America needs is action, Moore said in the interview.

Moore also declares that most of America agrees with him on the issues.

""Our choir is much bigger than Trump's choir or Fox News' choir,"" Moore claimed.

""Unfortunately, our choir is out of tune, and it's hard to hear our voices through all the sobbing and despair. That all ends on Sept. 21. The choir needs a song to sing. Once we come together in beautiful harmony, the Trump crime family will be prosecuted, law and order will be restored, we'll have Medicare for All and we'll declare that 'Game of Thrones' must remain on the air for at least three more seasons.""

He goes on to assert that America is a ""liberal country.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/08/09/trailer-review-of-filmmaker-michael-moores-fahrenheit-11-9-fans-flames-of-division-in-nation,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic']","['1', '2', '2', '2', '1']"
3T6EIBTM9M6901U78IKOEE16GYCAA9,"Trump critic Sen. Sasse says he's considering leaving Republican Party, calls WH a â€˜reality showâ€™","Sen. Ben Sasse reiterated on Sunday that he frequently considers leaving the Republican Party and is tired of the partisan gridlock inside the Washington Beltway.

Sasse, R-Neb., a deeply conservative lawmaker who has been a frequent critic of the Trump White House, said that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have â€œa future for the countryâ€ and that both are more focused on stymieing the other than passing actual legislation.

â€œThe main thing the Democrats are for is being Anti-Republican and Anti-Trump,â€ Sasse said on NBC's â€œMeet the Press.â€ â€œThe main thing the Republicans are for is being Anti-Democrat.â€

When asked about how frequently he considers leaving the Republican Party, Sasse said he thinks â€œabout it every dayâ€ and added that the Republican Party today bears little resemblance to the â€œparty of Lincoln and Reagan.â€

Sasseâ€™s comments come a day after the Nebraska lawmaker responded to a question posed to him on Twitter.

The commenter said she believed changing her Democratic affiliation to ""no-party"" would be ""part of the solution"" and then asked the first-term senator whether he might follow suit.

His response: ""yep â€” regularly consider it (except the 'from Dem' part)""

Just before that, Sasse wrote of his fear that ""we're headed toward a place where hefty majorities of both sides of the electorate are going to regularly embrace unsupported and blatantly false assertions.""

Republicans hold a 51-49 edge in the Senate going into the November elections.

Sasse has been one of the most frequent and vocal critics of Trump policies â€“ calling out the president for his handling of issues ranging from gun control to tariffs. While admitting that the president has been successful in some respects - including the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court â€“ Sasse added that ""itâ€™s pretty obviousâ€ that the presidentâ€™s administration is â€œa reality show soap opera.â€

""What you'd like is the president to not worry so much about the short-term of staffing, but the long-term of vision-casting for America,"" he said.



Sasse also made news last week when he lashed out at Trump for complaining that his own Justice Department's indictments against two Republican congressmen were endangering the GOP's midterm election prospects.

""The United States is not some banana republic with a two-tiered system of justice â€” one for the majority party and one for the minority party,"" Sasse said in a statement.

â€¢ An official said there were five fatalities and two other people were injured.

â€¢ Police identified the suspect in custody as Jarrod Ramos of Laurel, Maryland.

SAUL LOEB via Getty Images Police respond to a shooting at the office building that houses the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland, on Thursday.

Five people died and two were injured in a â€œtargeted attackâ€ on the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland, on Thursday, according to city officials.

On Friday, police identified the suspect as Jarrod Ramos, 38, a resident of Laurel, Maryland. Court records show that Ramos has been charged with five counts of first-degree murder and is being held without bond. The Capital Gazette confirmed on Twitter that Ramos had filed a defamation lawsuit against the paper and a columnist in 2012.

Bill Krampf, deputy chief of the Anne Arundel County Police Department, declined to name the suspect during a news briefing on Thursday but said he was a white male in his late 30s. Krampf said the man used a shotgun and â€œlooked for his victims as he walked throughâ€ the newsroom. The shooter barricaded the exit door so employees couldnâ€™t escape, prosecutors said during Fridayâ€™s bail hearing.

Authorities identified the victims as Wendi Winters, Rebecca Smith, Robert Hiaasen, Gerald Fischman and John McNamara, noting that all worked in some capacity for the Capital Gazette.

Krampf noted Thursday that the news outlet had received social media threats that indicated violence â€œas early as today,â€ although investigators were still determining who sent them.

â€œThis person was prepared today to come in, this person was prepared to shoot people,â€ Krampf said. â€œHis intent was to cause harm, and as I stated before, the investigative part of this is going to be thorough and itâ€™s going to take some time.â€

He continued: â€œThe Capital newspaper is our local newspaper. We interact with the Capital newspaper daily. We have friends at the Capital newspaper, we speak with these men and women on a daily basis. Weâ€™re here. Weâ€™re invested. Weâ€™re going to get this investigation right.â€

This person was prepared today to come in, this person was prepared to shoot people. His intent was to cause harm. Bill Krampf, deputy chief of the Anne Arundel County Police Department

Updating reporters Friday morning, Anne Arundel County Police Chief Timothy Altomare said the weapon used in the shooting was a pump-action shotgun that was legally purchased â€œa year or so ago.â€

He confirmed that the attack was â€œplanned,â€ citing evidence found in the shooterâ€™s apartment.

Altomare declined to use the suspectâ€™s name.

â€œI will not say his name today,â€ he said. â€œI refuse to do it. I wish you wouldnâ€™t do it, but I know better. He doesnâ€™t deserve us to talk about him one more second.â€

Authorities said officers were at the scene within approximately a minute of receiving 911 calls and that they evacuated 170 people from the building. They quickly took the suspect into custody, although Anne Arundel County Executive Steve Schuh said the man â€œhas not been very forthcomingâ€ about his motive, according to The Associated Press.

Early media reports indicated that the suspect had mutilated his fingers to avoid identification, but spokesmen for both Anne Arundel County Police and the County Executiveâ€™s Office told HuffPost that those reports were incorrect.

Authorities told NBC that the suspect was identified using facial recognition technology and that a search warrant had been issued for his home, which Altomare confirmed on Friday.

Krampf noted earlier Thursday that officials had discovered what they â€œthought may have been an explosive device that has been taken care ofâ€ at the scene of the crime. He later clarified that theyâ€™d found a bag containing smoke grenades.

Lisa Clough, director of media relations for the University of Maryland Medical Center, confirmed to HuffPost that one patient from the shooting was at their facility but could not confirm the type of wound or condition of the patient. Authorities described the injuries as superficial wounds, not gunshots, and said they may have been caused by broken glass in the newsroom.

During the shooting, reporters covered the situation as it occurred.

â€œA single shooter shot multiple people at my office, some of whom are dead,â€ tweeted Phil Davis, a reporter at the paper. â€œThere is nothing more terrifying than hearing multiple people get shot while youâ€™re under your desk and then hear the gunman reload.â€

The New York City Police Department also sent officers to major New York media outlets, including HuffPost, following the attack.

â€œThese deployments are not based on specific threat information, but rather out of an abundance of caution until we learn more about the suspect and motives behind the Maryland shooting,â€ Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller said in a statement. â€œIt has become a standard practice to shift resources strategically during active shooter or terrorist events.â€

He continued: â€œThere is no place in our society for this kind of hatred and violence, and the individual responsible for this horrendous crime must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.â€

Maryland has some of the nationâ€™s most stringent gun laws. A 2013 law generally bars the sale of so-called assault weapons like the AR-15, the semi-automatic rifle used in many recent mass shootings. The state also restricts the sale of rifles or shotguns for buyers with a history of mental illness, violent behavior, criminal convictions or drug addictions. In April, Hogan banned bump stocks and expanded law enforcementâ€™s ability to confiscate guns from troubled individuals with a measure known as a â€œred flagâ€ law. He also approved $5 million in funding for gun violence prevention programs.

Pro Basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal, who has been sworn in as a member of multiple police departments and plans to run for Henry County (Ga.) sheriff in 2020, says a solution for gun violence in schools is an increased police presence.

""Two things that have never mixed are children and guns,"" O'Neal said during an interview on WABC Radio on Wednesday. "" ... Something has to be done. You hear a lot of people talking about getting these guns off the streets. Only problem with that is there's 15 million of them out there already on the streets. Another problem is, if you ban them, then you're going to create an underground market, and the gun collectors are going to become more valuable.

""I think the quick fix now, the government should give law enforcement more money. Give more money, recruit more people, and the guys that are not ready to go in the streets, you put them in front of the schools. You put them in front of the schools, you put them behind the schools, you put them inside the schools.""

O'Neal last week voiced his support on social media for March For Our Lives â€” marches on the streets of Washington, D.C. and throughout the world during which the participants will ""demand that their lives and safety become a priority, and that we end gun violence in our schools and communities.""

I am proud to support the incredible students behind #marchforourlives. Join us on March 24 as we march on Washington, DC and across the country to demand an end to gun violence and mass shootings in America https://t.co/dt8b5D3GRr â€” SHAQ (@SHAQ) March 8, 2018

The marches, set for later this month, were organized by students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as a response to last month's deadly shooting.

""Hopefully it sends a message to the powers that be,"" O'Neal said. ""We have to stop this. I mean, I would like to see tougher background checks. It was just a sad incident. I really feel for the parents. Imagine being a parent going to work and you get a call that your baby was gunned down for no reason. At all. ... The children are the future. We have to protect our children. And if you can't protect our children, in school, where are they safe?""

32CAVSKPCF7XLMV5I48M3EKXJJD1UR,Gunman 'clearly targeted other gamers' at Florida tournament,"A California man who played video games to earn money for college and a West Virginian whose e-sports winnings helped support his young family were slain at a Florida tournament where a gunman specifically targeted fellow gamers, authorities said Monday.

David Katz, 24, of Baltimore, fatally shot himself after killing the two men and wounding 10 others Sunday inside a pizzeria and bar hosting a ""Madden NFL 19"" tournament. Katz was among about 130 gamers attending the competition at a mall in Jacksonville.

Court records in Maryland reviewed by The Associated Press show Katz had previously been hospitalized for mental illness. Divorce filings from his parents say that as an adolescent he was twice hospitalized in psychiatric facilities and was prescribed antipsychotic and antidepressant medications.

Katz carried two handguns, including one equipped with a laser sight, into the tournament venue but only fired one of them, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams told a news conference Monday. Surveillance video revealed Katz was the only shooter, but his motive remains unknown.

""The suspect clearly targeted other gamers who were in the back room"" of the pizzeria, Williams said. ""The suspect walked past patrons who were in other parts of the business and focused his attention on the gamers.""

Investigators determined Katz bought both guns in Baltimore within the past month. But Williams said there's no indication he planned the shooting before Sunday.

In a statement Monday evening EA CEO Andrew Wilson said he is canceling the remaining qualifier events to focus on safety.

""We have made a decision to cancel our three remaining Madden Classic qualifier events while we run a comprehensive review of safety protocols for competitors and spectators.""

The sheriff had previously said nine people were wounded by gunfire, but told reporters Monday the total was 10. All were expected to recover, he said.

The sheriff's office identified the dead as 22-year-old Elijah Clayton of Woodland Hills, California, and 28-year-old Taylor Robertson of Giles, West Virginia.

Clayton's parents and other relatives gathered outside police headquarters Monday in Jacksonville. A cousin, Brandi Pettijohn, said the family is ""devastated by yet another senseless act of gun violence."" She said Clayton was a good, peaceful man who never had a fistfight.

""He loved football, and out of all the videogames he could play, he settled on and mastered 'Madden,'"" Pettijohn said. ""He made a good living gaming, and he saved his earnings so he could afford to go to college to continue his education.""

Robertson, who used the gamer tag ""Spotmeplzzz,"" won the Madden Classic tournament in 2016. In a YouTube interview published by EA Sports, Robertson said he had played Madden NFL since he was 10 and started playing competitively a few years ago.

""It's certainly possible for any player to do this,"" Robertson said in the video. ""You've just got to put in the time. You've got to grind. You've got to play a lot of games and just working on getting better.""

Fellow gamers described Robertson as a family man dedicated to his wife and children.

Gamer Derek Jones, who lost to Robertson in the 2016 tournament, said his onetime rival was ""one of the nicest people I ever met.""

""There's no way that guy did anything to deserve to get shot,"" said Jones, who traveled to the Florida tournament from Santa Fe, New Mexico. ""He's got a family at home, and he just came out here to try to win some money for this family.""

Gamer Shay Kivlen of Seattle said he met Clayton, whose gamer tag was Trueboy, about five years ago. They bonded because both of them played games on a PlayStation 4 â€” which put them at odds with many gamers who prefer Microsoft's Xbox.

The two friends would chat daily online and see each other about six times a year at gaming tournaments. About a week before the Florida shootings, Kivlen said, he was visiting San Diego and Clayton drove 2 Â½ hours in rush hour traffic to meet him.

""He was one of the kindest people, most genuine guys I've ever met,"" said Kivlen, 21. ""He was super real, and that's what I loved about him. If he was happy, you knew he was happy. He wore his emotions on his sleeve.""

Kivlen and Jones said they barely knew Katz, who seemed to avoid conversation with fellow players during tournaments. Katz's gameplay was often erratic, Kivlen said.

""He would do kind of weird stuff online that other people wouldn't do. He would catch a ball and just start jumping out of bounds and stuff when he could have gotten more yards, just hurting himself,"" Kivlen said. ""I don't know what he was doing.""

Kivlen, who said he had once beaten Katz for a coveted spot in a tournament, heard secondhand from a friend that Katz was asking for his whereabouts shortly before the shooting.

After losing his single-elimination game Sunday, Kivlen said, he left to take a nap at his hotel about 20 minutes before the attack. He was watching a live stream of the tournament online when the gunfire erupted.

A friend hiding in a bathroom at the venue answered his phone. When he said Kivlen may have been a target, Kivlen called police and an officer was sent to his hotel room for about 90 minutes until they received word that the gunman was dead.

""It just doesn't make sense why he would do it,"" Kivlen said. ""In 'Madden,' you never get so mad at a loss that you would want to do that.""

CHICAGO â€“ This year, Romell Young got into a fistfight on the street near his home on the cityâ€™s West Side, pummeling a man in a brawl that was spurred by an argument he canâ€™t even remember.

Young does, however, have a scar to remind him what happened after he gave his rival a whupping: The man returned with a gun and shot him in the leg.

At the hospital, police asked Young, 23, to tell them who shot him, but he said he declined to name the assailant. Weeks after the April incident, Young â€“ who has a long arrest record and a felony conviction for drug possession â€“ was charged with illegal possession of a firearm after police said they caught him on the street with a weapon.

â€œI believe karma is (vengeful), you feel me?â€ said Young, explaining to USA TODAY in a jailhouse interview in July why he didnâ€™t name the man who shot him. â€œOne day youâ€™re going to reap what you sow.â€

Youngâ€™s no-snitching outlook sheds light on the complicated dynamic in Chicagoâ€™s neighborhoods plagued by gun violence, one in which few residents are willing to help police and even fewer perpetrators are held accountable.

Over the weekend, at least 72 people were shot in the city, including 12 fatally, but police did not record a single arrest in any of the incidents.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

In an emotional response, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson called on residents to speak up and cooperate with police.

CLOSE After 72 people were shot within one weekend in Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel called for the city to work together. USA TODAY

â€œYou all know who these individuals are. They come into your homes every day, sleep with you every night,â€ Johnson said. â€œGrandparents, parents, siblings, significant others â€“ you know who they are.â€

Chicago recorded more than 1,400 homicides and 6,200 shooting incidents in 2016 and 2017. This year the city has tallied more than 325 murders â€“ 20 percent fewer killings than at the same point in 2017 â€“ and the death toll puts Chicago again on pace to tally more homicides than any other American city.

The police department in the nationâ€™s third-largest city has solved far fewer murders over the past several years compared with most other major departments around the country.

Chicagoâ€™s clearance rate â€“ the calculation of cases that end with an arrest or identification of a suspect who canâ€™t be apprehended â€“ dipped to 26 percent in 2016 from 46 percent in 2013, according to the University of Chicago Crime Lab. Most of the killings, largely fueled by gang violence, take place in a smattering of low-income, predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods on the South and West sides of the city.

Last year, as the city tallied 650 murders, the clearance rate plummeted to 17.5 percent, according to a Chicago Sun-Times analysis. The national homicide clearance rate stood at 59 percent in 2016, according to FBI estimates.

The numbers are even more dismal for nonfatal shootings. The department cleared only 5 percent of shootings in 2016, according to the Crime Lab.

The dip in Chicagoâ€™s homicide clearance rate coincided with a diminished view of the police department in the cityâ€™s African-American community after the release of a police video that showed a white police officer fire 16 shots at Laquan McDonald, 17, a black suspect wielding a small knife. The officer, Jason Van Dyke, is scheduled to go on trial next month, accused of first-degree murder.

Even before the McDonald shooting, the police departmentâ€™s relationship in the African-American community had been strained by a long history of police brutality and allegations of heavy-handed tactics in the cityâ€™s low-income and minority communities.

Chicago borrowed about $709 million to pay settlements for police misconduct cases from 2010 to 2017, according to a report from the Action Center on Race &amp; the Economy.

A Justice Department review last year also found Chicago officers used force nearly 10 times more in incidents involving black suspects than against white suspects. African-Americans were the subject of 80 percent of all police firearm uses and 81 percent of all Taser contact-stun uses from January 2011 to April 2016, the DOJ found.

""I recognize not just as the superintendent but as a black man who grew up in Chicago and has been a cop for 30 years ... the fact that we have some relationships to repair and to build in the minority communities,"" Johnson said. ""But the simple fact of it is, the police department can't do it alone.""

But another factor preventing more witnesses of gun violence to come forward is the street mantra that â€œsnitches get stitches,â€ said the Rev. Ira Acree, a West Side pastor and anti-violence activist.

â€œPeople donâ€™t speak out because of fear,â€ Acree said. â€œWhat if you speak out and there is a price to pay with your life? It would be nice if there was some significant funding for witness protection, but in real life you donâ€™t get that.â€

Emanuel, who is up for re-election in February, has faced a barrage of scrutiny from his political opponents who say he has done too little to address violent crime and win trust in the black community.

In recent weeks, anti-violence protesters have twice rallied, temporarily shutting down highways, to decry the violence and blast his administration for doing too little to help low-income, minority communities.

The mayor and his supporters have pushed back against the notion that he hasnâ€™t acted, noting that in the aftermath of the McDonald video his administration has made it department policy to release police video of shootings within 60 days of an incident, equipped every beat officer with body cameras and tightened use-of-force standards.

Emanuel has also pointed to the $55 million his administration has poured into grants to spur small-business growth and job opportunities in many of the same neighborhoods hit hardest by the violence. He also has touted academic growth in the cityâ€™s school system â€“ with a student body that is about 86% black and Latino â€“ and his administrationâ€™s effort to create 30,000 paid internships around Chicago for teens and young adults.

On Tuesday, Emanuel and Johnson announced plans to redeploy as many as 600 officers to five areas that were home to most of the weekend violence. Johnson said the additional officers will stay in the districts until he's satisfied the violence is under control.

""We're going to work together and be honest about what the challenges are, what the solutions are, and where everybody can play a role to solve these problems,"" Emanuel said.

Still, his opponents say Emanuelâ€™s efforts arenâ€™t enough.

Garry McCarthy, a former police superintendent who is running against Emanuel, has accused the mayor of eroding public trust in rank-and-file cops. McCarthy was fired by Emanuel in 2015 amid public outrage over the release of the McDonald tape.

â€œThe political manipulation of the police department and the political landscape that has been created in this city by Rahm Emanuel is whatâ€™s fueling all of this,â€ McCarthy told Fox News.

Paul Vallas, another candidate who had lined up to try to unseat Emanuel, says part of the clearance-rate problem is that the mayor has been too slow in replacing detectives who have retired in recent years. Vallas has vowed to add more than 400 investigators to the department if he is elected. The department now has about 700 detectives, down from 1,200.

â€œWhat you have is people in the community who are shooting, and shooting again and again and again,â€ Vallas said. â€œItâ€™s taken a toll on the community. What weâ€™ve seen the last seven years and longer than that ... is the police department attritted out of the critical forces they need to be effective.â€

But Acree, the West Side pastor, said it is going to take far more than increasing the detective pool to encourage more residents to improve the cityâ€™s clearance rate record.

Itâ€™s no coincidence, he noted, that the same neighborhoods that have some of the cityâ€™s highest poverty rates also have the highest homicide rates:

â€œUntil there is a change in political leadership and prioritizing investment in these communities, this is going to continue to happen.â€

NASHVILLE, Tenn. â€” The man suspected of killing four people in a mass shooting at a Waffle House here will be committed to a mental hospital for treatment until he is fit to stand trial, a judge ruled Wednesday.

Wearing a bright yellow jumpsuit, Travis Reinking, 29, appeared in court to face his charges for the first time. He sat quietly while a forensic psychologist said he had schizophrenia so severe he would be unable to go to trial without medication and therapy.

Defendants are constitutionally required to meet a series of requirements before a trial can proceed: They must be able to work with a lawyer to defend themselves, understand court proceedings and understand the consequences of a trial.

After a hearing of about half an hour, Judge Mark Fishburn of Nashville-Davidson County Criminal Court ruled that Reinking was ""in definite need of training and medical treatment for his mental illness.""

Fishburn said it appeared that Reinking was not taking any medicine for his schizophrenia.

""Obviously, that's the first step in getting him to become competent,"" Fishburn said. ""The court does commit Mr. Reinking to Middle Tennessee Mental Health Institution to take whatever measures are reasonably necessary to see that he becomes and retains competency so that the trial in this case can proceed.""

â€œThe court does commit Mr. Reinking ... to take whatever measures are reasonably necessary to see that he becomes and retains competency.â€ Judge Mark Fishburn, Nashville-Davidson County (Tenn.) Criminal Court

The court will check on Reinking's status every six months, but Fishburn said he wanted to be notified immediately when Reinking was ready for a trial.

Trials can be delayed for months while defendants are institutionalized.

Family members of the dead and injured Waffle House victims packed into the courtroom's small gallery to face Reinking for the first time since the April 22 shooting. They moaned and shook their heads during psychologist Rena Isen's testimony.

Reinking remained stoic for much of the hearing but began speaking toward the end, seemingly trying to address Fishburn . A court officer and Reinking's public defender huddled around him and told him to be quiet.

As Reinking got up to leave, he waved to his mother, seated in the front row. She left without talking to reporters.

Outside the courtroom, De'Angelo Groves, whose sister DeEbony Groves was one of the people killed at the Waffle House, told reporters that he accepted the results of the hearing.

""I'm at peace. I just wanted the opportunity to see him in person and I got that,"" De'Angelo Groves said. ""I'm going to trust that they know what they're doing.""

Prosecutors asked for a judge to commit Reinking for mental health treatment.

Deputy District Attorney Roger Moore last week asked the court to consider more intensive treatment after Reinking's court-ordered mental evaluation found that he wasn't able to be tried for the killings. Moore took pains in court Wednesday to explain that Reinking would not dodge a trial altogether.

An insanity defense is possible in this case, legal experts have said. While that argument focuses on Reinking's state of mind at the time of the shooting, the issue Wednesday was Reinking's current mental state.

Reinking is charged in the deaths of Akilah DaSilva, 23; DeEbony Groves, 21; Joe R. Perez, 20; and Taurean C. Sanderlin, 29. He also faces four counts of attempted homicide and one count of using a firearm while committing a dangerous felony.

The Perez and DaSilva families have filed civil lawsuits against Reinking and his family.

3Q7TKIAPOUSOURONPJ0GDTPNVGALDC,Trump questions whether 3D printed guns should be available: 'Doesn't seem to make much sense',"In a tweet on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said he didn't think allowing people to create their own guns on 3D printers made ""much sense.""

3D printers can build just about any shape using plastic polymers. Cody Wilson, a former University of Texas law student, decided that he would try to design a gun that could be printed this way.

In May 2013, the State Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance ordered Wilson's organization, Defense Distributed, to stop distributing plans to download 3D printed guns.

On July 10, the U.S. Department of Justice reached a settlement with the Second Amendment Foundation, which had filed a suit on behalf of Defense Distributed. Under the terms of the agreement, the plans for 3D printed guns would be permitted to be downloaded beginning Wednesday.

On Sunday, a federal court in Pennsylvania ruled that plans for 3D guns could not legally be downloaded in that state. Defense Distributed has agreed to block Pennsylvanians from accessing its website.

On Monday, attorneys general from eight states and Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit demanding that the Trump administration stop Defense Distributed from making the plans available for download. In a statement when the lawsuit was announced, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson slammed the concept of 3D printed guns:

These downloadable guns are unregistered and very difficult to detect, even with metal detectors, and will be available to anyone regardless of age, mental health or criminal history. If the Trump Administration won't keep us safe, we will.

On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that he was ""looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public."" He added that he had already talked to the National Rifle Association and that making these guns readily available to the public ""doesn't seem to make much sense!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/07/31/trump-questions-whether-3d-printed-guns-should-be-available-doesnt-seem-to-make-much-sense,"['Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Neutral']","['5', '5', '5', '5', '4']"
3O2Y2UIUCRCA85K1VPJ5MTFTI2XKFD,"Rana hits out at 'wrong decisions', Bindra defends","India may have won nine medals at the Palembang Complex shooting ranges, but pistol king Jaspal Rana feels they could have won many more had Indian great Abhinav Bindra had ""done his bit"" when he was International Shooting Sport Federation's (ISSF) Athletes' Committee chairman from 2014 till 2018.

""We were the people who elected him. Indian shooters, coaches and officials, who were part of the contingent for the ISSF World Championships in Granada, Spain, in September 2014, voted for Bindra because he was a fellow shooter. But he (as ISSF Athletes' Commission chairman) removed some key shooting events, such as free pistol and 50m rifle prone among others, where our shooters were really, really strong.

""Bindra headed the sevenmember Athletes' Commission for four years and now has been nominated in the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Athletes' Commission. When he was the ISSF Athletes' Commission chairman, he could have at least asked the members in the commission to keep free pistol in the mix. There was no opposition from the Indian side (Bindra) and the revised list of shooting events was cleared. We could easily have won 13-14 medals in shooting at the Asian Games here had free pistol and 50m rifle prone been there,"" said Rana.

Bindra, the 2008 Beijing Olympics gold medallist, countered the allegation, saying, ""Anyone who understands the matter knows that this was not a personal decision. Mr Rana must look at the holistic picture and not base his thinking on emotions and his relationship with industry.

""We have to remain part of the Olympic Movement and every international federation has had to alter its programme. The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) president also sits on the executive board of the ISSF. The decision was thoughtful, which involved a thorough process. ISSF's decision was completely validated when the IOC's event-based analysis ranked the dropped events last among shooting sports.

""Also, this was a unanimous decision of both the ISSF admin council and executive committee. An extraordinary general assembly was called for, which all federations attended and the matter was discussed and voted on by all member federations of ISSF. The vote was completely in favour of changes. If there was a problem with the ISSF decision, Mr Rana should have made sure the NRAI brought it up at the right forum.""

On the issue of certain mixed team events being included to bring gender equality as mandated by the IOC, Rana, winner of four Asian Games gold medals, said, ""This talk about bringing gender equality in the Olympic Movement is just fine, but at least a thought should have been given to what events were being added, retained or removed.

""The air pistol event has always been there and they added a mixed team air pistol event for gender equality in the curriculum, which I feel was wrong.

""Why didn't he (Bindra) think about free pistol - a slightly more expensive sport than air pistol as live .22 cartridges are used - as it is as popular in India as air pistol?

""We had such a great mix of players like Jitu Rai, PN Prakash and Amanpreet Singh in 50m pistol and today they are not part of the Asian Games contingent only because of one wrong decision (of the ISSF).

""The event that could have been axed was 50m rifle three-position, an expensive sport. I've seen three-position shooters coming for national level events in buses and second-class railway compartments just to save money to buy equipment. The 50m prone event could have been retained and three-position removed from international curriculum. The reverse happened. When we all voted for Abhinav, we didn't know this would happen,"" concluded Jaspal.

The West Virginia Senate race just got a little more interesting now that former coal mine tycoon Don Blankenship has re-entered the contest as a candidate for the Constitution Party. However, West Virginia's ""sour grapes"" law may bar him from appearing on the ballot.

On Tuesday, he filed his certificate of candidacy in person at the West Virginia secretary of state's office. Blankenship will challenge incumbent Joe Manchin (D) and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R) in November.

""Today, I officially filed my paperwork for the office of U.S. Senate as a member of the Constitution Party. As I have repeatedly said, I am the only candidate who cannot be bought by out of state billionaires and I will work hard to drain the swamp,"" Blankenship tweeted Tuesday afternoon.

-- Don Blankenship (@DonBlankenship) July 24, 2018

The failed GOP primary candidate, who lost to Morrisey in May, announced last week that he had gathered enough signatures in his petition drive to have his name added to the midterm ballot. He accepted the Constitution Party nomination shortly after his primary defeat.

The Cook Political Report has ranked the race as a toss-up between Manchin and Morrisey, but Blankenship's re-entry could be the factor that swings the race either way.

Some voters believe Blankenship could shake up the match enough to guarantee Manchin maintains his seat, but Blankenship said he's confident he'll clinch the win.

""I don't think so because I'm pretty well-known in southern West Virginia which is where Joe will have a big margin if I'm not in the race. But I expect to take enough votes from both of them to win the election,"" Blankenship told WOWK-TV.

The wealthy candidate said he's willing to spend an unlimited amount of money to seize the Senate seat.

""It's always that way,"" he told reporters Tuesday. ""Whatever it takes to win,""

""Voters won't be distracted by efforts to divert attention away from lying liberal Joe Manchin's record of supporting pro-abortion policies, gun control, and Hillary Clinton's campaign against coal miners,"" Morrisey said in a written statement to TheBlaze.

""You know I just think it offers folks another choice and I think it shows the chaos that's with the Republican Party that they are not satisfied with their candidate,"" WV Democratic Party chairperson Belinda Biafore said, according to WOWK.

The secretary of state told WOWK in a statement on Tuesday that a decision regarding Blankenship's eligibility would be made by the close of business Wednesday.

""Candidates affiliated with a recognized political party who run for election in a primary election and who lose the nomination cannot change her or his voter registration to a minor party organization/unaffiliated candidate to take advantage of the later filing deadlines and have their name on the subsequent general election ballot,"" according to West Virginia election laws.

Blankenship has called the sour grapes law unconstitutional.

If the secretary of state rules that he cannot run because of the law, Blankenship would likely contest the decision.

Controversy has surrounded Blankenship.

Ahead of May's GOP primary, the candidate launched political TV ads that attacked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his Chinese-American wife Elaine Chao who serves as U.S. secretary of transportation.

In the ad, Blankenship referred to McConnell as ""cocaine Mitch"" and used the terms ""China People"" and ""China family.""

""Swamp captain Mitch McConnell has created millions of jobs for China people. While doing so, Mitch has gotten rich,"" Blankenship said in the ad. ""In fact, his China family has given him tens of millions of dollars. Mitch's swamp people are now running false negative ads about me. They are also childishly calling me despicable and mentally ill. The war to drain the swamp and create jobs for West Virginia people has begun. I will beat Joe Manchin and ditch cocaine Mitch for the sake of the kids.""

Blankenship has denied that his China references were racist.

In 2016, a federal judge sentenced the former Massey CEO to a year in prison for conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards related to the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion in 2010 that left 29 miners dead.

Austin (AFP) - The US ""crypto-anarchist"" who caused panic this week by publishing online blueprints for 3D-printed firearms said Wednesday that whatever the outcome of a legal battle, he has already succeeded in his political goal of spreading the designs far and wide.

A federal court judge blocked Texan Cody Wilson's website on Tuesday by issuing a temporary injunction.

Eight states had sued, arguing the blueprints could allow anyone -- from a teen to a ""lone wolf"" gunman -- to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons.

Wilson complied with the judge's order and shut down his Defcad website, which he wanted to turn into the ""WikiLeaks of guns.""

But by then, the blueprints he had posted -- after President Donald Trump's administration granted him permission to publish in a settlement to end a five-year legal battle -- had been downloaded thousands of times.

""No matter how badly I win or lose, you can download a gun from the internet,"" Wilson told AFP at the headquarters of Defense Distributed, the company he runs out of a modest factory in Texas capital Austin.

""This attempt by these authorities to go into court and stifle this information drove more people to the website to download it and spread it deeper into the internet.""

Sporting a pair of gray jeans and a dark blue t-shirt, the 30-year-old with a close-cropped beard wouldn't appear out of place as a tech executive in Silicon Valley.

The ideology he says he is driven by is a defense of the US constitution's first and second amendments -- the rights to free speech and to bear arms.

Wilson believes the intense media attention he generated cemented one of his principal goals: to use technology and the spread of gun-making information as a permanent bulwark against any future attempts at gun control in the US.

""We believe that the firearm itself, this implement of violence, is an essential component of force, of sovereignty,"" he says.

He concedes that what he has done, and still wants to do, ""offends the conscience"" of some people, but he says ""it's never been illegal in this country to make a firearm -- and the way that you make it shouldn't affect that law.""

- Anarchist philosophy -

Wilson subscribes to an anarchist philosophy that the free exchange of ideas on the internet -- in its absolute form -- is a check on government.

""It's a politics that predicted WikiLeaks, predicted Bitcoin, predicted anonymous mail and anonymous communications online,"" he says.

The law school dropout has dedicated the last five years of his life to the cause of unfettered online access to gun-making information.

""I'm a publisher. At the end of the day, I do many things, but the main thing that I strive to do is to take my information and put it on the internet,"" he says.

Defense Distributed, the company Wilson co-founded in 2013 and currently heads, is more than a publishing firm -- it sells actual firearms products.

It has created a machine called the ""Ghost Gunner,"" priced at $2,000. Computer code operates the machine, which carves essential components of various firearms to create weapons without serial numbers.

- 'Ghost guns' -

Such weapons -- called ""ghost guns"" -- are already being made by those who can properly carve metal components.

The ""Ghost Gunner"" takes away the need for advanced skill and creates untraceable weapons.

The issue is far from academic. The Los Angeles Police Department last month showcased a trove of ""ghost"" weapons it recovered from gang members. Law enforcement cannot trace these weapons if they are used to commit crimes.

That is why lawmakers, law enforcement personnel, gun control groups and even Trump himself expressed everything from panic to skepticism this week when Wilson started distributing blueprints online.

Those blueprints included his company's own creation, the ""Liberator"" plastic gun -- a sidearm that resembles something seen on science fiction TV shows.

The potential impact of Wilson's publication was worldwide. Any country with uncensored access to the internet could see its gun control measures circumvented with a click of a mouse.

""It is immediately obvious to anyone who looks at this issue that 3D-printed guns are nothing short of a menace to society,"" said Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

""We will continue to do everything in our power to make sure that this temporary halt in publication becomes a permanent one,"" Gardiner said after the injunction.

Wilson also plans to fight, just as he unsuccessfully fought in the courts for five years.

The judge that ordered his website shut plans to hold a hearing on the states' lawsuit next week.

Wilson put out a call for donations to fund the legal challenge, but is aware that he may be facing a losing battle.

""I believe that duty demands that I continue to fight it,"" he said, while admitting that ""I think I'll waste a lot of money.""",https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-crypto-anarchist-sees-3d-printed-guns-fundamental-040318092.html,"['Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Republican', 'Neutral', 'Republican']","['5', '5', '5', '5', '5']"
3QXFBUZ4ZLYUP1L80NTPA1O3L8VUGJ,The entire Republican Party is becoming a Russian asset,"In the past few days, President Trump has given at least some Republicans reason to express displeasure over his relationship with Russia. First he performed a pathetic ritual of subservience before Vladimir Putin, standing beside the Russian leader â€” after a private meeting between the two, which no aides were permitted to attend â€” and dismissing the copious evidence of a Russian attack on the 2016 election in deference to Putinâ€™s word.

Then we learned that Putin had suggested that we make Americans available to the Kremlin for questioning, including Michael McFaul, the former U.S. ambassador to Russia, in exchange for allowing us to question some of the agents who carried out the cyberattack. Trump had called it â€œan incredible offer,â€ and the White House said he was considering it, before finally backing down after the Senate unanimously passed a resolution condemning the idea.

But look past the modest number of Republicans saying that Trump has gone a bit too far here or there, and you see a very different picture. The truth is that the entire GOP is well on its way to becoming a Russian asset.

Are there a few Republican dissenters? Sure. But perhaps weâ€™re having difficulty viewing that whole picture because whatâ€™s happening is so utterly bonkers that we canâ€™t quite bring ourselves to see it clearly. So letâ€™s review just some of the things we know:

In 2016, the campaign of the Republican nominee for president was approached multiple times by representatives of the Russian government offering to help them win the election. These offers were welcomed with enthusiasm. The campaign was also led for a time by a political consultant with deep financial and personal ties to a Russian oligarch and a Kremlin puppet in Ukraine.

Multiple members of the Trump team had contacts with the Russian government that they later lied to conceal.

As part of its attack on the American electoral system, Russian intelligence hacked into Democratic Party systems. Some of the information it found there was released publicly and promoted gleefully by Republicans at all levels in order to help the Trump campaign; information relating to down-ballot campaigns was passed to Republicans, who used it in order to maintain their hold on the House of Representatives.

Amid the insistence from the intelligence community that in 2018 Russia will likely attempt to once again penetrate the computer systems of state election agencies, Republicans this week killed an effort to provide funding to states to bolster the security of their election systems.

As part of a lengthy effort to infiltrate the National Rifle Association, an important Republican interest group, an alleged Russian spy began a romance with a Republican activist, met multiple Republican leaders and fostered a relationship between American gun advocates and Russians. On the night of Trumpâ€™s victory, she messaged â€œI am ready for further ordersâ€ to her handler, a Russian banker named Alexander Torshin who is close to Putin.

The NRA dramatically increased its spending on the 2016 presidential campaign from past years, pouring $30 million into their effort to elect Trump. The FBI is investigating whether that money may have illegally come from Russia, funneled to the organization by Torshin.

The Trump administration has announced a change to IRS rules so that groups like the NRA will no longer have to identify their donors on their tax forms, making such money almost impossible to trace in the future.

Over the last few years, the Christian right, another key part of the GOP coalition, has grown increasingly close to Putin, whom they see as an ally in a global clash of civilizations between Christianity and Islam.

In Congress, Republicans have undertaken an aggressive campaign to discredit and, many of them plainly hope, shut down the probe into the Russian attack on America. Though they mounted seven separate investigations of Benghazi, they are nearly united in their position that no further investigation into a hostile foreign powerâ€™s attempt to manipulate the American electoral system is necessary.

Fox News, which functions as the propaganda arm of the Republican Party, has aired relentless attacks on the Russia investigation and calls for it to be shut down.

Despite the mountain of unambiguous evidence of the Russian attack in 2016, the overwhelming majority of Republican voters continue to say no such attack occurred.

Hard-core Trump supporters are beginning to argue that even if Russia did attack the American electoral system, it was actually a good thing because it helped Donald Trump get elected.

That last argument has not yet filtered up to more mainstream Republican figures, but give it some time. When Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III closes his investigation and presents all his evidence (and more indictments, surely), no one will really be surprised to hear Republican members of Congress and prominent conservative media figures saying that it all worked out for the best because Hillary Clinton isnâ€™t president, and we should just move on.

The president himself has laid the groundwork for that argument to spread. Not only has he repeatedly cast doubt on whether the attack occurred, he insists that he himself didnâ€™t â€œcolludeâ€ with Russia, and no matter what, thereâ€™s no proof that the attack changed votes, as though that would somehow make the whole thing okay. And you may recall that when news broke that his son, son-in-law and campaign chairman met with a group of Russians in hopes of getting dirt on Clinton, an outreach that had been presented to them as â€œpart of Russia and its governmentâ€™s support for Mr. Trump,â€ the president claimed that â€œI think from a practical standpoint most people would have taken that meeting,â€ as though working with Russia to defeat his opponent was the most natural thing in the world.

We can speculate on exactly why Trump has been so eager to become Putinâ€™s flunky; itâ€™s obviously a complicated story with roots that go back decades. But what about the rest of the GOP? Some of them have embraced the annexation of their party with gusto, while others are clearly more reluctant. But letâ€™s not forget that they were reluctant to make peace with Trumpâ€™s takeover of the GOP, too. Eventually, they realized that since Trump had captured the hearts of the Republican base, they had no choice but to get on board if they wanted to survive.

The same has happened, and will likely continue to happen, with Russia. Had you told them 10 years ago that Russian intelligence was going to mount a comprehensive assault on an American election, theyâ€™d say that they would respond to such an attack with a furious rage and leave no stone unturned in learning every detail about it so that any collaborators could be mercilessly punished and no such attack could ever occur again. Today though, theyâ€™re mostly eager to get everyone to think about something else.

It may be because theyâ€™ve convinced themselves that no tactic is too repugnant, no alliance is too distasteful, and no moral compromise is too loathsome when youâ€™re serving the lofty goal of keeping Democrats from power. Or it may be that theyâ€™re terrified that their rabid base will decide that they are insufficiently devoted to the cult of Trump. Whatever the reasons, theyâ€™ve traveled a long way down this road already, and it doesnâ€™t look like theyâ€™re turning back.

On Friday, it was reported that the NRA is facing a serious financial obstacle after the State of New York used a regulatory office to levy a $7 million fine on the group over its insurance products.

After the news broke, Kerr jumped to Twitter to mock the NRA saying, â€œDonâ€™t send moneyâ€¦â€¦thoughts and prayers should suffice.â€

Don't send moneyâ€¦â€¦thoughts and prayers should suffice. https://t.co/uYIWvgK8CD â€” Steve Kerr (@SteveKerr) August 4, 2018

Kerrâ€™s Twitter assault was two-pronged. On the one hand, it was an attack on the NRA, but on the other, it could be viewed as a dig Christians who offer heartfelt prayers for those facing hard times.

For several years, left-wingers have been attacking Christians for offering â€œthoughts and prayersâ€ in times of strife. The attacks came to a head recently after the shootings in a Florida high school and the attack at an Annapolis, Maryland newspaper.

One who was attacked for offering hopeful prayers for a sufferer was actor Chris Pratt, an outspoken Christian, who was slammed for offering the â€œhealing power of prayerâ€ to director Kevin Smith after the latter announced that he had a heart attack.

In another case, the New York Daily News mocked Christians for offering prayers for shooting victims instead of working to implement gun control laws.

Also, Hollywood director Judd Apatow excoriated Christians for their â€œthoughts and prayersâ€ and said that offering prayers is just a way of saying â€œgo fu*k yourself.â€

The NRA filed a lawsuit against the State of New York warning that Gov. Andrew Cuomoâ€™s blacklisting campaign is driving the organization into financial ruin.

The NRAâ€™s suit comes two months after the stateâ€™s Department of Financial Services (DFS) declared the NRAâ€™s Carry Guard insurance â€œillegalâ€ and forced the cancellation of all such policies issued in New York. The state also fined the group $7 million even though the policies are actually underwritten in Kansas, not New York.

34HEO7RUG7C1ZIGOAT6A94QGGR6AR1,Parkland Victim's Father Slams Actress Blaming NRA for Shooting,"Actress Alyssa Milano rallied at a festival Sunday night to encourage young people to vote in the midterm elections, while also blaming the National Rifle Association (NRA) for the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, months ago.

The father of a victim who was killed when a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018, said Milano ""needs to learn her facts before she speaks.""

Andrew Pollack, the father of Meadow, slammed the actress for blaming the NRA for his daughter's death.

In a tweet, Pollack said it wasn't the NRA's fault, however, ""The FBI, Sherrif Israel, mental illness counselors, school administrators &amp; failed diversionary programs are to blame.""

At the Actions For Change festival in Parkland, the actress gave a speech where she claimed that in the mass shooting's aftermath, the U.S. government was too influenced by the NRA, WLRN-TV reported.

""We live in a nation where numbers are really no longer persuasive,"" Milano said. ""Numbers no longer persuade policy.""

Milano at Kavanaugh Hearing

Milano was a guest at the recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexually assaulting, testified.

Watch the video below:

Milano, a #MeToo activist, told CNN, ""It was a very hard day to be in that room, but I was proud to be a woman and I was proud to be a survivor, and I felt like I needed to be there for other survivors that couldn't be there.""

Released Tuesday, Milano wrote an opinion article for CNN, where she called Kavanaugh a ""sexual predator,"" while also attacking President Donald Trump and advocating for Ford.

She wrote:

""We cannot confirm Brett Kavanaugh. We cannot allow another generation of women and children to grow up knowing their government and those acting in its name see us as less than human. We cannot let Kavanaugh and Trump be the lasting.""

The father of the Parkland victim

Pollack has also previously been vocal in politics dealing with the Parkland shooting, when he tweeted, ""Stop weaponizing Parkland to advance a dangerous political agenda!""

Fred Guttenberg, a father to another Parkland victim, was invited to Kavanaugh's hearing in early September.

Guttenberg is an advocate for gun control and made headlines when he attempted to shake Kavanaugh's hand during the hearing, then claimed Kavanaugh ignored him, which Kavanaugh denied, saying he thought the man was another protestor.

Kavanaugh responded to the incident in a written response to the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying it was a ""chaotic"" morning and he ""did not recognize the man.""

""I assumed he was a protester,"" Kavanaugh explained. ""... If I had known who he was, I would have shaken his hand, talked to him, and expressed my sympathy. And I would have listened to him.""

Pollack addressed Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), once again stating, ""Please stop weaponizing the death of my daughter to push your radical agenda.""",https://ijr.com/parkland-victim-father-nra-actress/,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Republican', 'Democratic', 'Neutral']","['5', '5', '4', '5', '3']"
3OZ4VAIBEYX4TI09DJOX30I2RY9VJJ,"Virginia judge rules against Paul Manafort, will let fraud case continue","A federal judge in Virginia concluded Tuesday that special counsels are given too much latitude and that the current one is prosecuting Paul Manafort only so he will offer evidence against President Trump.

But those thoughts do little for the ex-lobbyist, because U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III ultimately ruled that Robert S. Mueller IIIâ€™s prosecution of Manafort on bank and tax fraud charges can go forward.

â€œAlthough this case will continue, those involved should be sensitive to the danger unleashed when political disagreements are transformed into partisan prosecutions,â€ the judge wrote.

If there are no further delays, the July 25 trial in U.S. District Court in Alexandria will be the first case brought by Muellerâ€™s team to come before a jury.

Ellis made waves when he grilled prosecutors from the special counselâ€™s office last month, questioning whether the crimes Manafort is accused of committing while working for a Russia-backed political party in the Ukraine were outside the scope of their investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

[Federal judge says special counsel wants Manafort to â€˜singâ€™ about Trump]

The judge concluded that while he is, in general, skeptical of special counsels, this one was legally created and followed its mandate in prosecuting Manafort, the presidentâ€™s onetime campaign chairman.

The May 2017 order appointing Mueller â€œplainly authorizes the investigation of indirect links between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government,â€ Ellis wrote, and â€œthe Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes that arise out of his authorized investigation.â€

That authorization was only made more clear, Ellis added, by an August 2017 memorandum explicitly stating that the Manafort investigation fell under the special counselâ€™s purview.

Manafort, 69, is accused in both Alexandria and D.C. federal courts of illegally obscuring his work for pro-Russian Ukrainian politician Viktor Yanukovychâ€™s Party of Regions. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases and argued that the charges against him have nothing to do with the 2016 election.

As he did in court last month, Ellis asserted in his opinion that Muellerâ€™s real interest in Manafort is as a cooperator against the president.

â€œEven a blind person can see that the true target of the Special Counselâ€™s investigation is President Trump, not defendant, and that defendantâ€™s prosecution is part of that larger plan,â€ he wrote in a footnote. â€œAlthough these kinds of high-pressure prosecutorial tactics are neither uncommon nor illegal, they are distasteful.â€

Ellis also reiterated his concern that the special counselâ€™s jurisdiction was too broad, calling it â€œa close question.â€ Special counsels generally, he wrote, are too similar to independent counsels of the past that could be seen as a â€œpolitical weapon.â€ He wrote that a â€œbipartisan commission with subpoena powerâ€ would be a better mechanism for investigating Russiaâ€™s role in the election.

Republicans have blocked efforts to establish such a commission.

Ellisâ€™s similarly skeptical comments at the May hearing cheered supporters of the president. At the time, Trump himself praised the judge from the stage of a National Rifle Association event in Dallas, calling him â€œsomething very special.â€

Ellis found that the Manafort investigation falls squarely within the realm of possible collusion between Trump officials and the Russian government and noted that the inquiry was approved by the deputy attorney general.

Even so, he questioned the breadth of the probe.

â€œThe wisdom of allowing all links between individuals associated with President Trumpâ€™s campaign and the Russian government to be subject to investigation, irrespective of how stale those connections might be, is seriously in doubt,â€ Ellis wrote in a footnote. â€œNevertheless, the grant of investigatory authority is written broadly, and does capture the connections at issue in this case.â€

Manafort, who in his career as a consultant advised both Republican presidents and foreign dictators, was struggling financially in 2005 when he was connected with Yanukovych, whose party was dominated by oligarchs who made their fortunes after the fall of the Soviet Union. Manafort burnished their image at home with sharp rhetoric and in the United States with talk of working together and supporting NATO.

The effort succeeded â€” YanuÂ­kovych was elected president in 2010. But he was ousted four years later amid widespread anti-

corruption protests.

In Virginia, Manafort is accused of illegally hiding millions of dollars that prosecutors say he made from that work in offshore bank accounts and failing to pay taxes on it. When Yanukovych was unseated and the money dried up, prosecutors say Manafort lied about his income and debt to secure millions in new loans against expensive real estate he had bought with the illegal income.

In the District, Manafort is accused of failing to register as a foreign agent when he lobbied for Yanukovych and lying about doing so, while conspiring to launder the money he made.

Manafort served as Trumpâ€™s campaign chairman for five months, resigning in the wake of reports that his work involving Ukraine may have been unlawful.

Manafort has put forward additional legal challenges, some of which will be aired at a hearing on Friday. He has disputed the constitutionality of searches of his Alexandria home and storage unit. He also wants Ellis to look into leaks to reporters of information about the case, alleging they were intended to bias jurors.

Ellisâ€™s decision echoes one reached last month by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who denied a similar motion to dismiss charges in the District. That case has grown heated, with the special counselâ€™s office accusing Manafort of pressuring witnesses to testify falsely and Jackson ordering he be held in jail pending a Sept. 17 trial.

33KGGVH24VZP2QP0N9J9NLJ1D1TX1E,2018 fall music preview: The albums we're most excited to hear,"Hey guys, remember albums? Music consumption habits have certainly changed dramatically in recent years due to the advent of streaming services. But when what is known in the biz as the ""fourth quarter"" comes around and the holiday shopping season approaches, record labels still attempt to entice music fans to give their full attention (and money) to a slew of exciting new releases -- like the ones listed here, ranging from indie darlings (the 1975, Christine and the Queens, Brockhampton) to classic rock heroes (Paul McCartney, Elvis Costello, Ann Wilson) to posthumous retrospectives (Prince, Tom Petty).

Keep in mind that in an era of surprise album drops, our seemingly exhaustive guide to this fall's most anticipated LPs could easily expand. And many artists (Madonna, Rihanna, Lil' Wayne, Janet Jackson, Frank Ocean, Jennifer Lopez, ScHoolboy Q, Anderson.Paak, the Struts, My Bloody Valentine, Greta Van Fleet, Liam Payne, Robyn, and Vampire Weekend, to name but a few) have rumored albums in works -- with no confirmed release dates. But these suggestions are surely enough to help get your shopping started.

Sept. 7

Paul McCartney, Egypt Station

Though parts of it were recorded at the famed Abbey Road studio, the 76-year-old Beatle's 17th solo album will boast a contemporary pop/rock sound, judging from the singles ""I Don't Know,"" ""Come on to Me,"" and the amusing titled (and surprisingly raunchy!) ""Fuh You."" Macca teamed with superstar pop producers Greg Kurstin (Adele, Beck, Sia, Foo Fighters) and Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic for the ""concept album,"" and he's been promoting it in a thoroughly modern manner, playing secret shows and indulging in a bit of delightful ""Carpool Karaoke"" with James Corden.

MNEK, Language

He's only 23, but the British pop prodigy has been in the business for a decade -- and, incredibly, he has already collaborated with BeyoncÃ©, Kylie Minogue, Madonna, Stormzy, Dua Lipa, and many others. Now it's time for him to make a name for himself on both sides of the pond with his effervescent solo debut.

Paul Simon, In the Blue Light

As the legendary troubadour, also age 76, retires from touring, he's in a nostalgic mood, revisiting some of his old favorites here. But this is no slapped-together greatest-hits collection. ""This album consists of songs that I thought were almost right, or were odd enough to be overlooked,"" Simon recently told Rolling Stone. ""Re-doing arrangements, harmonic structures, and lyrics that didn't make their meaning clear gave me time to clarify in my own head what I wanted to say, or realize what I was thinking and make it more easily understood."" We'll soon find out if songs like ""Can't Run But"" and ""RenÃ© and Georgette Magritte With Their Dog After the War"" are better the second time around.

Spiritualized, And Nothing Hurt

The heady head music of Jason Pierce's venerable shoegaze band's first album in six years -- and possibly their last -- is sure to have all you ladies and gentlemen floating in space once again. Swirling soundscapes like ""I'm Your Man"" and ""A Perfect Miracle"" are, well, just about perfect.

Macy Gray, Ruby

The cheeky lead single off the funky diva's 10th album, ""Sugar Daddy,"" was co-written by Meghan Trainor; it signals a return to Gray's upbeat signature groove after her 2016 release, the more low-key jazz covers collection Stripped. Other A-list collaborators include producers Johan Carlsson (Ariana Grande, Maroon 5), Tommy Brown (Jennifer Lopez, Fifth Harmony, Travis Scott), and Tommy Parker Lumpkins (Janet Jackson, Justin Bieber).

Lenny Kravitz, Raise Vibration

The rocker returns with his 11th album -- his first since 2014, after a struggle with writer's block. Playing most of the instruments himself, Kravitz seems to have gotten his mojo back, and Raise Vibration may be his most eclectic effort yet. One single, ""It's Enough,"" tackles hot topics like corporate greed, political corruption, and racism, while another, ""Low,"" explores his past sexual relationships. Let love rule, indeed.

Everlast, Whitey Ford's House of Pain

The veteran SoCal rapper is back with his first full-length studio album of since 2011, and he seems to have a lot on his mind. Lead single ""The Culling"" is a protest anthem (sample lyric: ""When politicians talk/Assume they're lying/Living on your knees/Much worse than dying""); ""The Climb"" and ""One of Us"" reference his 9-year-old child's battle with cystic fibrosis; and ""Don't Complain"" blasts materialism and and fame-worship within the hip-hop scene. Aloe Blacc also features on the bluesy ""Slow Your Roll.""

Sept. 14

Carrie Underwood, Cry Pretty

The country Idol has been in the headlines all year due to the media's obsession with her facial scar, her triumphant post-injury comeback at the Academy of Country Music Awards, and her recently announced second pregnancy. Now her sixth studio album, which is being hyped as her darkest and grittiest work to date, will keep her in the spotlight. Cry Pretty marks the first co-producing effort by Underwood, who teamed with Grammy-winning Florida Georgia Line producer David Garcia for the record.

Ann Wilson, Immortal

The Heart frontwoman, one of the greatest rock singers of all time, pays homage to dearly departed music legends like George Michael (""A Different Corner""), Leonard Cohen (""A Thousand Kisses Deep""), Amy Winehouse (""Back to Black""), David Bowie (""I'm Afraid of Americans""), Tom Petty (""Luna""), and her friend Chris Cornell (Audioslave's ""I Am the Highway""). Her rendition of Lesley Gore's ""You Don't Own Me"" is especially revelatory in this #MeToo era.

Dreams, No One Defeats Us

Australian rock royalty, Empire of the Sun's Luke Steele and Silverchair's Daniel Johns, comprise this electro-rock super-duo. The slinky vocoder workouts ""Movies"" and ""Silence"" and the rallying cry of the death-disco title track sound nothing like either band member's other projects, but sound thrilling nonetheless. The twosome recently made their worldwide live debut at Coachella.

Willie Nelson, My Way

The Red Headed Stranger honors Ol' Blue Eyes on this lovely collection of Frank Sinatra covers. It's not the first time that the country outlaw has dipped into the Great American Songbook: His 1978 album, Stardust, featured interpretations of standards like ""Summer Wind"" (revisited here). Sinatra reportedly called Nelson his favorite singer after hearing Stardust, and he'd surely approve of this record as well.

Good Charlotte, Generation Rx

Punk-pop's favorite twins are back, still young and hopeless after all these years. The album is said to be a return to their emo roots, as evidenced by the dark and heavy first single, ""Actual Pain,"" inspired by the opioid crisis and their experience performing at the memorial service last year for rapper/Good Charlotte fan Lil Peep, who died from a fentanyl/Xanax overdose.

Tony Bennett &amp; Diana Krall, Love Is Here to Stay

The 92-years-young crooner celebrates George Gershwin's 120th birthday by teaming with his onetime tour-mate and his friend of two decades, jazz chanteuse Krall, for this collection of Gershwin interpretations. Krall has previously appeared on two Bennett albums, Duets and Playin' With My Friends, but this is their first full joint album. The Grammy-winning Bill Charlap Trio provides backing.

Paul Weller, True Meanings

The Modfather says his seminal proto-Britpop band the Jam will never reunite, but he's releasing enough solo work at a steady clip to keep his fans happy. His 14th solo album, the follow-up to last year's A Kind Revolution, will include special guests such as the Zombies' Rod Argent and Oasis's Noel Gallagher.

Jungle, For Ever

The ""Busy Earnin'"" London soul collective and festival favorites follow up their 2014 Mercury Music Prize-nominated debut with an ambitious effort, recorded in Hollywood, that they liken to a ""post-apocalyptic radio station playing breakup songs.""

Sept. 21

Prince, Piano and a Microphone 1983

From the seemingly bottomless purple vaults comes this previously unheard cassette artifact recorded at Prince's Kiowa Trail home studio in Chanhassen, Minn. Raw, intimate recordings of ""17 Days,"" ""Purple Rain,"" ""Strange Relationship,"" Joni Mitchell's ""A Case of You,"" and the spiritual ""Mary Don't You Weep"" should provide a fascinating glimpse of the late genius at work.

Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators, Living the Dream

Somehow, while embarking on the fourth-highest-grossing concert tour of all time for the past two years with the reunited Guns N' Roses, the legendary GNR guitarist found time to record a new album, fronted by also-quite-busy Alter Bridge singer Kennedy. The anthemic instant classic ""Driving Rain"" is already the most successful single to ever be released under Slash's name.

The London Suede, The Blue Hour

The lavish eighth studio album by the criminally underrated '90s Britpop dandies traffics in the same grandiose glam that made them NME darlings 25 years ago. This one gets an extra symphonic/sonic boost from legendary producer Alan Moulder (Nine Inch Nails, the Killers, Arctic Monkeys, Interpol, Smashing Pumpkins, My Bloody Valentine).

Josh Groban, Bridges

The popera superstar teams with Andrea Bocelli, Sugarland's Jennifer Nettles, and Sarah McLachlan for his eighth studio album. Grab the deluxe version for a bonus track of Billy Joel's ""She's Always a Woman,"" a song that seems tailor-made for Groban's silky vocals.

Christine and the Queens, Chris

The gender-bending French art-pop provocateur (real name: HÃ©loÃ¯se Letissier) unveils her macho ""Chris"" persona on the much-anticipated follow-up to her 2016 debut, which landed on best-of lists at The Guardian, Mojo, and NME. The latter magazine reports that Chris will sport a ""sweaty"" and tougher, harder, sexier sound.

Metric, TITLE TBA

The venerable Canadian electro-rockers, currently on tour with Smashing Pumpkins, return with their as-yet-untitled seventh full-length. The singles ""Dark Saturday"" and ""Dressed to Suppress"" have already garnered acclaim from NPR, The New York Times, and Rolling Stone.

Sept. 28

Tom Petty, An American Treasure boxed set

Coming up on the one-year anniversary of the singer-songwriter's shocking death, this 60-track, four-disc collection of previously unreleased material -- curated by Petty's daughter Adria, wife Dana, Heartbreakers bandmates Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell, and longtime collaborator Ryan Ulyate -- is sure to be a bittersweet but exhilarating listen.

Cher, Dancing Queen

Mamma mia! The diva, inspired by her recent role in the Mamma Mia movie sequel, is turning back time by dipping into ABBA's classic catalog. She tackles camp favorites like ""Waterloo"" and ""Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight),"" of course, but we can't wait to hear her version of the heartstring-tugging breakup ballad ""The Winner Takes It All.""

Nile Rodgers &amp; Chic, It's About Time

Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Rodgers is one of the greatest producers and songwriters in pop history, having worked with Diana Ross, Madonna, David Bowie, Daft Punk, Duran Duran, Kylie Minogue, Keith Urban, and many other superstars. Finally he's back with his own aptly titled album -- Chic's first in 26 years! -- kicking off with the single ""Till the World Falls,"" featuring Mura Masa, Cosha, and Vic Mensa. Other album guests will reportedly include Lady Gaga, Elton John, Miguel, Janelle Monae, Disclosure, and Anderson.Paak. Freak out!

Cypress Hill, Elephants on Acid

The rap/rock pioneers' first album in eight years is an ambitious, psychedelic, 21-track affair. Group member Muggs, who produced the acid-rockin' LP, told Rolling Stone that it will give the listener a ""feeling like you're high on hallucinogenic drugs -- but you're not on no drugs."" So, say nope to dope and ugh to rugs, and say yes to this dope album instead, kids!

Rod Stewart, Blood Red Roses

Rod the Mod find himself in a reflective mood on his intimate, personal 30th studio album, which coincides with the 50th anniversary of now 73-year-old rock crooner signing his first solo record deal. For instance, the lead single ""Didn't I"" addresses drug abuse from the point of view of a parent -- an interesting and unexpected perspective from a man well known for crazy party antics back in his rock 'n' roll heyday.

Brockhampton, Iridescence (exact September date TBD)

The Pharrell-championed alternative hip-hop collective builds on the buzz of their 2016 mixtape All-American Trash and 2017 Saturation trilogy with their first full-length release for RCA. The group was supposed to drop records titled either Team Effort or Puppy earlier this year, but following allegations of sexual assault against former member Ameer Van, Puppy was delayed. With Van now ousted from the lineup, Iridescence marks a new beginning for Brockhampton.

Loretta Lynn, Wouldn't It Be Great

For her 41st studio album, the Coal Miner's Daughter enlists her own daughter, Patsy Lynn Russell, who co-produces with John Carter Cash (the son of Johnny and June). The album, which contains new material plus remakes of previously recorded Lynn tunes, is the third in a series of five albums recorded at Cash Cabin Studio in Tennessee.

Oct. 5

The 1975, A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships (exact October date TBD)

Following their Mercury Prize-nominated, nearly million-selling 2016 sophomore album, the Mancunian indie-poppers are pleasing their devoted and patient fans with two upcoming albums: first this one, led by the hyperactive singles ""Give Yourself a Try"" and ""TOOTIMETOOTIMETOOTIME,"" followed by Notes on a Conditional Form, which will likely end up on our ""most anticipated albums of spring 2019"" list.

Eric Church, Desperate Man

The country star recently made headlines, and possibly alienated many conservative fans, when he controversially spoke out against the NRA in the wake of the Route 91 Harvest festival shooting in Las Vegas. Now, as he releases his eighth album almost exactly one year after that tragedy, we will find out if the country community sticks with him, or if he gets the Dixie Chicks treatment.

twenty one pilots, Trench

Three years after their massive commercial breakthrough Blurryface, the masked men are back with 14 new hard-charging, alt-rock/hip-hop anthems. They nearly broke the internet in July when they broke their yearlong silence by posting the album announcement along with an updated band logo, so suffice to say, the anticipation is high for this one.

Steve Perry, Traces

Following a two-decade hiatus from recording, the reclusive ex-Journey singer is suddenly, surprisingly back with a 10-song album inspired by his girlfriend Kellie Nash, the love of his life, who died in 2012. On a happier note, judging from the strident, arena-ready power ballad ""No Erasin',"" it also sounds as if he's been inspired by Journey's classic Escape/Frontiers era.

Cat Power, Wanderer

The exquisite Chan Marshall returns with her self-produced 10th album (her first in six years), this time aided by another mysterious chanteuse, Lana Del Rey, on the single ""Woman."" The singer-songwriter, who recently celebrated the 20th anniversary of her classic album Moon Pix with a special show at the Sydney Opera House, explained the inspiration for the long-delayed album to Pitchfork: ""The course my life has taken in this journey -- going from town to town, with my guitar, telling my tale, with reverence to the people who did this generations before me. Folk singers, blues singers, and everything in between. They were all wanderers, and I am lucky to be among them.""

Coheed and Cambria, Vaxis -- Act 1: The Unheavenly Creatures

The much-worshipped prog-rockers continue their Amory Wars comic book concept on their ninth album. A deluxe boxed-set version will include a novella written by lead singer and guitarist Claudio Sanchez and his wife, Chondra Echert, with artwork by Chase Stone and a demo CD, The Crown Heights Demos -- the perfect holiday gift for the C&amp;C fan who has everything.

KT Tunstall, WAX

The Scottish singer-songwriter's sixth studio album (and second in her spiritual KIN trilogy) sees her joining forces with former Franz Ferdinand member Nick McCarthy, who produces. The album will explore complex themes of physicality. One track that's sure to be intense: ""The Night That Bowie Died.""

Oct. 12

Elvis Costello &amp; The Imposters, Look Now

It's been five years since his last album release, but a recent cancer scare doesn't seem to be slowing down Elvis the C, one of the greatest and most prolific singer-songwriters of all time. The 12-song record sees him pairing up with two other songwriting legends: his Painted From Memory collaborator, Burt Bacharach, and Carole King. ""I knew if we could make an album with the scope of Imperial Bedroom and some of the beauty and emotion of Painted From Memory, we would really have something,"" Costello says in a press release. Sounds like quite an understatement!

Oct. 19

Yoko Ono, Warzone

The multimedia artist/singer-songwriter/peace activist is still fearless at age 85. On her latest work, issued by her son Sean Ono Lennon's label Chimera Music, the Beatle wife is just as polarizing as ever as she reworks her late husband's beloved classic, ""Imagine."" The rest of the album comprises 12 reimagined tracks from her catalog. ""I like to create things in a new way,"" she said in a statement. ""Every day things change.""

Oct. 26

Boy George &amp; Culture Club, Life

After an aborted attempt at recording the comeback album Tribes in 2015 (a BBC documentary, Boy George and Culture Club: Karma to Calamity, detailed that disastrous experience, and the band even refunded PledgeMusic fans who had ordered the album), the gender-bending, genre-blending new wave pioneers are finally ready to release this reworked, retitled version. It remains to be seen if the new music will succeed, but fans will surely snatch up tickets to see Culture Club tour with the B-52's this fall.

Andrea Bocelli, SÃ¬

The Italian tenor, widely considered to be one of the greatest singers of all time, celebrates his 60th birthday by teaming up with legendary rock producer Bob Ezrin (Pink Floyd, KISS, Lou Reed). And it's likely that his recent collaboration with Ed Sheeran will draw in new rock fans who may have not even been alive when his last album of all-new material came out 14 long years ago.

Tom Odell, Jubilee Road

The BRITs Critics' Choice Award-winning troubadour returns with his most personal album to date, written in his home ""on a quiet terraced street in East London."" Along with all of Odell's critical acclaim, it seems Cher is a fan!

Nov. 2

The Prodigy, No Tourists

The seventh studio album by the electronica firestarters finds them in fierce, fine form, still making music that speaks to the jilted generation. Lead single ""Need Some1"" is a classic jittery '90s rave banger with a serrated metal edge.

Nov. 9

Muse, Simulation Theory

The proggy, stadium-packing Britrockers finally return with their eighth studio album, their first since 2015's Drones.

The 61-year-old woman ""was struck by a shot on Saturday morning inside a hospital in Niteroi,"" the police for the state of Rio said in a statement.

The woman's son told G1 news site that she had been a patient in the Santa Martha hospital for 18 days and was undergoing tests ahead of surgery.

The woman was struck in the face. Her condition was stable, she risked losing all or some of her eyesight, relatives were quoted as saying.

G1 ran a photo of what it said was the bullet hole in the frame of the hospital room window.

Parts of the greater Rio de Janeiro urban area are devastated by daily gun violence in which heavily armed police confront ruthless narcotics gangs. Bystanders -- often people far from the shooting -- are regularly hit by stray bullets.

This week, a report said that Brazil's overall murder rate continues to soar, reaching nearly 64,000 violent deaths in 2017. By far the most deadly areas are in the north of the country.

Overall, more than seven homicides occur every hour across Latin America's biggest nation, according to the report from the respected, non-profit Brazilian Forum for Public Security.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/stray-bullet-hits-woman-rio-janeiro-hospital-161717717.html,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['1', '1', '1', '1', '1']"
3K8CQCU3KFJDRXRZIRLLI9IX7RGNWP,Democrats Don't Want A Leader Like Andrew Cuomo  --  Do They?,"Last winter, a Democratic legislator who is often mentioned as a presidential candidate visited BuzzFeed's offices and talked frankly about how the party will approach the 2020 presidential election.

""There are two ways to run against Trump,"" he reflected. ""One is to say, Trump has opened this new kind of politics, and if we don't do what he does -- the battlefield has changed, we need to compete on his terms.

""And those are the people who say [that] your governor down here, Governor Cuomo, is the only Democrat who's unscrupulous enough to out-Trump Trump.""

The Democrat went on to say he preferred the other path, a unifying campaign on the model of Obama's in 2008. But he had spoken something bluntly that Democrats who are frankly afraid of the New York governor sometimes say in private: That what he has going for him is his utter ruthlessness. He is, at his best, Lyndon Johnson; at his worst, more like Nixon.

The legislator's blunt reflections on Cuomo's appeal came to mind this week because the New York governor is closing out his primary campaign with a kind of caricature of hamfisted machine politics: Sending a mailer out to Jewish voters smearing his progressive rival as an anti-semite, and rushing to open a bridge that wasn't quite ready to open.

I've covered Cuomo since his first campaign for governor in 2002, though never closely. He's actually very little like Trump when it comes to rules and to the system itself: He's never acted with disdain for the rules. When it comes to rules, he's literal-minded. My first encounters with him came when he was playing just on this side of the campaign finance line; his encounters with reformers and prosecutors and regulators have always kept him just this side of the limits, with his foes ranting that he's obviously violating the spirit of laws meant to prevent turning government into a political machine.

He was also, in that spirit, a pioneer in the sort of secure messaging that is now routine: In 2012, the Daily News revealed that he insisted on communicating with his staff via BlackBerry's BBMs, which had the advantage of sending data from one device to another with no backup left on a corporate server for nosy investigators to find.

And Cuomo isn't here to destroy the political system. He is, rather, the ultimate creature of the state's sclerotic political system and its true master. Where Trump has struggled to master the political machinery of his office, Cuomo lives to use his to bend the state to his will. For his allies, his control of the levers of power can be immensely satisfying -- even at times for the progressives and reformers now in rebellion against him.

I remember vividly when his hapless predecessor, David Paterson, was about to bring marriage to the floor of the Senate in 2009. I spoke the night before to a marriage equality campaigner who was preparing his victory speech. But Paterson hadn't counted the votes; and nobody was scared of crossing him; it wasn't even close when the measure failed.

Everyone is scared of Cuomo. A few years ago, I interviewed another powerful New York politician who, in passing, mentioned an earlier conflict with Cuomo. Half an hour after she left, she called to plead that a story not mention that she said anything about the conflict -- for fear of antagonizing him again. Mayor Bill de Blasio has stayed neutral in the governor's race because, as Nixon accurately said on AM2DM Monday, Cuomo is ""notoriously vindictive.""

And Cuomo knows how to count votes. When he brought marriage to the floor in 2011, he did so with the votes of several senators who had voted against it in 2009. When the bill passed, it played widely as a moving moment in the state's history; it was also a effective demonstration of raw political power. When other liberals deplored gun violence after the Newtown school shooting, Cuomo rammed through a bill a month later that expanded background checks and a ban on assault weapons. He banned fracking, and he raised the minimum wage to $15. There's something to marvel at there, shades of Caro's Johnson.

Unlike Johnson, though, he has reserved those progressive shows of force for social issues that don't require new taxes; his government has also sought to keep taxes down and avoid expensive projects that go beyond rewards to political allies, as in the case of the notorious Buffalo Billion. In an era of big progressive ambitions, there are limits to what you can do without raising taxes.

That's the core of Cynthia Nixon's critique: ""He slashed taxes on the wealthiest, and he's slashed services on everybody else. He's lost $25 billion from state revenue.""

People around Cuomo have always acknowledged he's thinking of running for president. No serious governor of New York doesn't. And even as he says the only reason he wouldn't serve a full third term as governor would be if ""God strikes me dead,"" it's not unreasonable to think that -- as ugly as this campaign looks for him now -- certain signals would push him toward an early exit. If wins against Nixon by an even greater margin than he did in 2014 -- when he got 62% of the vote against Zephyr Teachout -- that would be one signal. A big victory in November would be another.

And is that what the reform-minded, socialist-leaning Democratic Party of 2018 wants? A master operator of the system and dealmaker? Their own Trump -- only you could see him being pretty good, scary good, at being president? It is hard to imagine, but you see why Cuomo might be thinking it.",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/bensmith/andrew-cuomo-new-york-primary-2020,"['Republican', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic']","['1', '4', '2', '5', '2']"

Gun-toting West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (D) released a new ad Monday that shows him shooting at the Obamacare lawsuit backed by his Republican challenger, Patrick Morrisey.

The ad plays on Manchin's 2010 ad that showed him shooting at a climate change bill. Manchin has taken up the 20-state GOP lawsuit against Obamacare as a weapon against Morrisey, the state attorney general. Morrisey has said he would like to see the Affordable Care Act declared unconstitutional and overturned.

A judge in Fort Worth, Texas, began hearing oral arguments in the Republican-led lawsuit against Obamacare last week.

Manchin's ad begins with a flashback to his popular 2010 ad.

""Hey, I haven't changed. I might be a few years older but I'll still take on anyone who messes with West Virginia,"" Manchin said in the ad. ""Now, the threat is Patrick Morrisey's lawsuit to take away health care from people with pre-existing conditions.""

""He is just dead wrong and that ain't gonna happen,"" he continued.

Morrisey's campaign stated in a news release that the senator's new ad was an effort to cover up Manchin's ""liberal record of failing to protect the Second Amendment.""

""West Virginia has been hurt by lying liberal Joe Manchin putting the interest of Washington liberals ahead of the health care and gun rights of West Virginians,"" Nathan Brand, Morrisey campaign spokesman, said in a news release. ""Joe Manchin has a 'D' rating from the NRA, and voted against President Trump's efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. Lying liberal Joe has been wrong for West Virginia.""

The National Rifle Association recently released an ad that emphasized Manchin's D-rating with the organization. The group endorsed the senator in 2012, but his rating has slipped since 2012 based on his voting record.

""They want to take away your Second Amendment. You see what's going on. I don't think you want your Second Amendment played with,"" President Donald Trump said in the ad that was taken from last month's rally in West Virginia. ""Joe Manchin always voted for Obama. And I like Joe, but Joe doesn't vote for us.""

In recent polls, Manchin's double-digit lead has shrunk to single digits, according to FiveThirtyEight.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/09/10/wv-sen-gun-toting-joe-manchin-fires-off-pro-obamacare-ad-that-shoots-down-lawsuit,"['Republican', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Republican', 'Neutral', 'Republican']","['1', '4', '2', '2', '5']"
3THR0FZ95QBFYOFCFSEWON1MZRFLO1,How Mark Sanford met Maria Butina,"(CNN) Rep. Mark Sanford, the South Carolina Republican and frequent critic of President Donald Trump, had his own run-in with accused Russian spy Maria Butina at his family farm last year.

Butina and her boyfriend, Paul Erickson, were two of roughly 300 guests attending a post-Thanksgiving barbeque last year that Sanford holds annually at his farm roughly an hour outside of Charleston, South Carolina.

Butina was charged this week with acting as a covert Russian agent in the US, conspiring with a Russian official and allegedly using sex and deception to build her network and expand her influence. Her efforts, according to prosecutors, were aided by an American political operative who helped her gain access to US political organizations and politicians. That person is not identified in court filings but the activities and description match Erickson, who has been involved in a years-long romantic relationship with Butina. Erickson has not faced charges in relation to Butina's case.

Rep. Mark Sanford, at left, a South Carolina Republican, and Maria Butina, an accused Russian spy appears at right.

But to Sanford, Butina was the girlfriend of his business-school classmate who was trying to start the equivalent of the National Rifle Association in Russia.

""I did meet her, a few interactions were pleasant,"" Sanford told CNN in an interview. ""It's the girlfriend of a guy I've known for 30 years. She seemed nice enough.""

3DFYDSXB2XI4G3B98TES7EGJD0CUJN,Photographing the youngest face transplant in U.S. history,"The story behind photographing the youngest face transplant in US history

Lynn Johnson was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, when she got the call that a donor had been found for Katie Stubblefield, who survived a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the face at age 18.

Stubblefield, then 21 years old, received a full-face transplant in May 2017, making her the youngest recipient in United States history. She had previously undergone 22 surgeries for over two years to rebuild parts of her nose, mouth and forehead. Now Johnson would be there to see her receive an entirely new face.

Johnson wasn't supposed to document this medical marvel however. Maggie Steber had taken pictures of Stubblefeld and her family for over two years. But, when donor Adrea Schneider died of a drug overdose, Steber was on assignment in Dubai. So, Johnson was called in with her Leica camera to capture the 31-hour surgery.

USA TODAY caught up with Johnson about Stubblefield's surgery and the stunning images published on National Geographic's September cover: The Story of a Face.

What was it like being there for 31 hours?

On one hand it felt like three hours. On another hand it felt like three days. I was in the surgery photographing for most of that time with the exception of a couple of hours where I caught a nap.

It was completely fascinating because even though a lot of the time it was surgeons leaning over one young woman or another, doing their very delicate work, there always seemed to be something interesting going on. The configuration of people changed in the room all the time. The people with different kinds of expertise came in and out. Folks were there for the donor.

Once in a while I would go out and visit with the family to let them know that things were going well. It wasnâ€™t really my place to report on events, but they just had such concern, of course, for the process. I thought that was something that was just compassionate to do.

Iâ€™ve photographed in a lot of medical situations and O.R.s, and I will say I have never seen so many people in a surgical suite, particularly on the donorâ€™s side. At one point, there were probably 30 or more people in that room. I just kept going back and forth between the adjoining operating rooms to keep an eye on the main surgeons.

It was very interesting to see what everyoneâ€™s role was, not just surgically, but ethically, morally and spiritually. Everyone seemed to be bringing whoever they are to that table.

What's one example of morals being brought into the operating room?

There were a couple of times when the two lead surgeons were trying to decide whether to use the partial tissue for the transplant or the full face. It was a long discussion that took place over what felt like a few hours. I know a couple of times they came out to talk to the parents, to Robb and Alesia.

They actually put the face on Katieâ€™s body to show the parents what she would look like, and the big discussion was what would Katie want? Of course itâ€™s very difficult to know because along with the better cosmetic solution came a greater risk of infection, a greater risk of rejection, so it was a real toss-up. In the end, the parents decided Katie would want the more complete and beautiful face, so thatâ€™s what they did.

What were some of the biggest challenges on this assignment?

I think the biggest challenges of the day are always on the side of the people whose lives you are documenting. Theyâ€™re the ones who have the biggest challenge. This has been a multi-year journey for this family, and of course they were praying that their child comes through the surgery alive and as intact as possible. I was very aware of that.

As a photographer, the challenge was just to be there, to be attentive and be aware and never blink and listen to the conversations so you can anticipate what might happen at any given moment. Also, I tried to learn about the technology used and understand those moral quandaries that were very much a part of this surgery.

Were there specific moments that stand out for you?

The moment they removed the face tissue from the donor and put it on the tray to photograph was very memorable, and I think everyone just stopped. It was very clearly, in its own way, a sacred moment. We are not used to thinking of our identities as transferrable. The face belonging to one young woman, and then moving into the next room to become the identity of another. There isnâ€™t much in our lives that prepares us. We donâ€™t have a map that prepares us for that event.

How did you prepare?

I donâ€™t know if you can really prepare for it. Iâ€™ve prepared by photographing for 40 years. Iâ€™ve been doing this for a while. I think all the experiences Iâ€™ve been fortunate to gather in my skills and psyche and emotional strength served me in this situation. You have to be able to concentrate and put a lot of things aside while you focus on whatâ€™s in front of you.

There was not time to prepare basically. I just pitched some stuff in the car and drove to Cleveland. I have this practice where I try not to think about what Iâ€™m going to do, not to have preconceived notions but just to faithfully gather visually what is in front of me. So the challenge is being in the right place and being attentive and being respectful.

Can I say one more thing? I think itâ€™s very easy to look at the spectacle of this, and both Maggie and I are adamant about this, that itâ€™s not about us. This is about this extraordinary young lady and family, and all the issues of organ donation and gun violence.

Thereâ€™s so many deeper issues here. Photographs are an opportunity to talk about those things and create conversations about those emotionally-charged topics that we seem less and less able to discuss in this country. My hope is that the images can be a catalyst for a deeper discussion, especially around access to weapons and teenage depression and suicide.

3RZS0FBRWLS4GKX7HFYCA4GPFZBPC8,Donald Trump Jr. Just Defended Alex Jones and InfoWars on Twitter,"Monday evening, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones begged Donald Trump to come to his rescue, after a slew of large tech companies began to ban the personality from their platforms based on their hate speech policies. Directly appealing to Trump, Jones asked him on air to ""make the censorship the big issue"" before the midterms, or risk losing the country.

For a noted proponent of fake news and wild conspiracies, it normally would have been a far-cry, but a tweet from Donald Trump Jr. Tuesday morning showed that Jones' ask didn't fall on deaf ears in the Trump family. Using Jones' own rhetoric, of a ""purge"" and ""censorship,"" Trump Jr. rushed to InfoWars' defense, framing the moves against it as part of a larger campaign of censorship that Jones himself posited in an address last night.

A Democrat Senator openly admitting that Big Tech's censorship campaign is really about purging all conservative media.

How long before Big Tech and their Democrat friends move to censor and purge @BreitbartNews, @DailyCaller and other conservatives voices from their platforms? https://t.co/sFS7mr8Pco

-- Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr)

August 7, 2018

Trump Jr.'s tweet echoed Jones' monologue from Monday, where he suggested that big technology companies, at the behest of the Chinese government, were ""beta-testing"" new means of censorship on Jones, which they planned to role out across conservative media in the future.

The nod to Jones' conspiracy theory isn't the first time Trump Jr. has hopped on InfoWars' train to jumped conclusions. In February, Trump Jr. liked two conspiratorial tweets about the Parkland, Florida school shooting, one of which suggested that Parkland activist David Hogg was some sort of government plant because his dad is a former FBI agent.

In April, Trump Jr. tweeted that a shooter at YouTube headquarters had her videos pulled down more quickly because she held certain progressive viewpoints.

You think there's any chance whatsoever that a mass shooters hateful Instagram and YouTube channels would be pulled immediately if they were NRA members as opposed to liberal Vegan PETA activists? Asking for a few million friends in the @NRA -- Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr)

April 4, 2018

During the 2016 election, Trump Jr. quickly turned into his father's ambassador to the alt-right fringe, tweeting and supporting statements and theories that might be too toxic for his father, but that resonated with some member's of Trump's base. Perhaps most famously, Trump Jr. posted a photoshopped image of himself, Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Pepe the Frog (who has become a mascot for the alt-right and white nationalists), and other key members from his father's campaign.

Given Trump Jr.'s history and role as his father's fringe liaison, it may not be surprising that Trump Jr. is speaking out about big tech's decision to finally silence InfoWars, but it's no less disturbing. Alex Jones and InfoWars have consistently peddled racist (birtherism), homophobic (gay chemical warfare), and disgusting (Sandy Hook was staged) conspiracy theories that have basis in almost zero fact. The idea that the president's son, who played an active role in Trump's campaign and continues to engage in the conservative movement, supports such ideas should terrify us.

On Sunday Breitbart News reported that the Jacksonville Landing, the location of Sundayâ€™s shooting, was a gun-free zone.

In other words, the attack occurred in a gun-free climate just as the Parkland high school shooting (Feb. 14, 2018), the Orlando Pulse shooting (June 12, 2016), the Umpqua Community College shooting (October 1, 2015), the Ft.

Following news of Sundayâ€™s shooting in Jacksonville, Pelosi tweeted, â€œMy thoughts are with everyone impacted by the shooting today at the Jacksonville Landing â€” but thoughts are not enough. As we continue to track developments, itâ€™s clear Congress must stop stalling &amp; act to protect Americans from the daily tragedy of gun violence. #NeverAgain.â€

375VMB7D4K1M4QGH4G33LDXVEYKDI2,"More links revealed between accused spy, NRA and Russian billionaire","More ties have emerged between accused Russian spy Maria Butina and the National Rifle Association -- and now a Russian billionaire, according to a new report.

Leaders with the powerful gun rights lobby met with Svetlana Nikolaeva, the wife of a Russian billionaire who allegedly funded Butina's gun rights group, the Guardian reported.

In December 2015, the NRA delegation -- including then-first vice president Pete Brownell and former President David Keene - were in Moscow for an expedition party funded by Butina's organization, Right to Bear Arms.

During the trip, they met with Nikolaeva at the headquarters of Orsis, the parent company of her Promtechnologies - which provides sniper rifles to the Russian military and intelligence services.

Also in attendance was David Clarke, the former Milwaukee county sheriff and staunch Trump supporter.

The Americans enjoyed meals and meetings with influential Russians like Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, whose son was an executive as Orsis.

Last week, it was revealed that Butina's Right to Bear Arms funded $6,000 of Clarke's meal, hotel and transportation expenses, according to his financial disclosure form, Fox 6 reported.

Butina was charged in the US last week with infiltrating political circles to send information back to the Kremlin.

At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in April, Butina said Nikolaeva's husband, Konstantin Nikolaev, provided funding for her pro-gun group, the Washington Post reported.

To do so, the feds said the 29-year-old dated a 56-year-old American man and used him for his connections to the Republican party and NRA.

His identity has not been made public but he is believed to be South Dakota GOP strategist Paul Erickson.

Butina also allegedly offered sex in exchange for a job within a ""special interest organization,"" the feds said.

3RKHNXPHGXEZRNHRQEE48TGWSPCUKM,"With a Friend in the White House, Gun Sales Sag","DALLAS â€” President Trump spoke to a cheering crowd at the National Rifle Associationâ€™s annual conference in May, saying gun owners had no stronger ally than the president and the Republican majority in Congress.

Quotes in the article Sturm Ruger &amp; Co Inc RGR â–¼ 69.05 -0.25 -0.36%

For gun makers, it turns out, this is a mixed blessing.

Since Mr. Trumpâ€™s 2016 victory, sales have slowed, particularly for the top-selling AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, so much that gun executives have termed it the â€œTrump slump.â€ An industry that capitalized on fear of gun control to drive sales during Democratic administrations is finding it is hard to turn out buyers when those concerns dissipate.

â€œSales have normalized because you donâ€™t have the fear-based market,â€ said Mark Eliason, vice president of sales and marketing at Windham Weaponry, a Maine gun maker.

Mark Kresser, former chief executive of gun maker Taurus Holdings Inc., said the AR-15 boom probably wonâ€™t return absent another political shift. â€œThe shine is coming off the nickel,â€ he said.

Smith &amp; Wesson parent company American Outdoor Brands Corp. said falling demand for its AR-style rifles caused revenue from long guns to fall 50% to $90 million for the year ended April 30, compared with the previous fiscal year.

Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. Inc. reported a 13.5% drop in firearms net sales for the first six months of the year compared with a year earlier. The company doesnâ€™t break down sales by type of firearms, but it sells AR-15-style rifles.

With no available industrywide sales data, background checks provide a rough measure of the decline in overall firearm sales. The checks fell 11% in 2017 from a record in 2016, according to an analysis of data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry group. That excludes checks for concealed weapons and other permits not related to gun purchases.

Remington Outdoor Co. filed for bankruptcy in March and emerged two months later. It is the oldest U.S. gun maker, founded in 1816, and makes AR-style rifles under its Bushmaster and DPMS Panther Arms brands.

Gun makers are now seeking to counter slumping sales of the rapid-fire weapon, which played a big part in reviving the U.S. gun industry. At the NRAâ€™s spring convention in Dallas, they offered new colors, sizes and models. Windham Weaponry offered two AR-style rifles in new calibers, one designed for hunting and another for long-range sharpshooting.

For decades, the AR-15 attracted little interest from gun owners, gun companies or gun-control advocates. Colt introduced the rifle to the civilian market in 1964 as the semiautomatic version of the M16 rifle used by the U.S. military. It was marketed as the â€œsuperb hunting partner,â€ but sales never took off. Colt was the only maker of the model until it came off patent in 1977.

Randy Luth, founder of DPMS Panther Arms, said some traditional gun owners accustomed to bolt-action hunting rifles and shotguns shied away from the military-style weapon when he first began selling them in the early 1990s.

Legislative opposition to such rifles began after a 1989 schoolyard shooting in Stockton, Calif., where a gunman armed with a semiautomatic AK-47 killed five people and injured 32. President Bill Clinton signed the Federal Assault Weapons Ban in 1994 that restricted the manufacture of various types of semiautomatic guns and limited sales to older models.

The ban expired in 2004 and the industry quickly ramped up production: U.S. companies made one million AR-style rifles in the following four years, according to the shooting sports foundationâ€™s estimates.

The timing was fortuitous for gun makers. Thousands of American veterans who had used the military version of the rifle in Iraq and Afghanistan were returning home. â€œThe Army was actually educating future customers,â€ Mr. Luth said, about â€œthe success and fun of an AR-15.â€ He now runs a gun-parts company Luth-AR after selling DPMS in 2007.

The weaponâ€™s designâ€”lightweight and easy to shootâ€”broadened its appeal. Gun owners easily swapped out parts and added accessories. Fans called them Legos for adults.

â€œThereâ€™s a â€˜wannabeâ€™ factor as well,â€ said Bill Silver, a former sales executive at Kalashnikov USA and former head of commercial sales at SIG Sauer. â€œPeople want to be a special-forces guy.â€

More significantly, periodic government calls for restricting or banning the AR-15, which has been used in some of the deadliest mass killings, sparked waves of panic gun-buying during President Barack Obamaâ€™s two terms.

â€œObama was the best AR-15 salesman there was,â€ said Chris Waltz, a 54-year-old gun dealer and Army veteran in Warner Robins, Ga.

Similarly, the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency drove sales in the months leading to the November 2016 presidential election.

Mark Westrom, former owner and CEO of AR-rifle maker Armalite, recalled the buyer panic after Mr. Obama called for an assault-weapons ban after the December 2012 killing of 20 children and six adults at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., by a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle. The legislation failed.

â€œThe structure of the market was massively expanded by various panics,â€ said Mr. Westrom, who ran Armalite from 1994 to 2013. He said the company ramped up production during these periods, carefully calculating their duration.

â€œThis is an odd market that is stimulated by Democratic administrations,â€ Mr. Westrom said.

The â€œanxious buyerâ€ was considered the largest group of potential first-time gun buyers, according to a 2017 marketing report produced by Southwick Associates Inc. for the shooting sports foundation.

Â© Provided by The Wall Street Journal. For years, AR-15-style semi-automatic rifles have been one of the biggest drivers of growth for the gun industry. But President Donald Trump's election triggered an unexpected response: A slump in demand.

â€œDrawing attention to the concern that firearm sales could be further restricted will have a great impact on Anxious Buyers,â€ the report said, citing AR-style weapons as â€œbest betsâ€ for these prospects.

Buyer demand pushed AR-style rifles from a niche product to more than a quarter of the $10 billion U.S. firearm market last year, according to analysts. At least 143 companies, from small gun makers to publicly traded giants, make the rifles, according to the 2016 Shooterâ€™s Bible Guide to AR-15s, more than double the number of manufacturers from five years earlier.

Companies made 9.3 million AR-style and similar rifles in the U.S. for domestic sales from 2009 through 2016, compared with 2.1 million in the previous 19 years, according to the shooting sports industry group.

Mr. Waltz, the Georgia veteran, wasnâ€™t planning to build a gun business when he began making his Facebook posts complaining about calls for an assault-rifle ban after the Sandy Hook killings.

He trademarked the name â€œAR-15 Gun Owners of America,â€ and then set up an online store selling T-shirts and badges. Soon he started selling complete rifles, scopes, parts and ammunition. Business got so good he hired seven employees and bought a boat and RV.

Every time an official raised the idea of restricting sales of AR-15s, sales jumped. When Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Waltz said, things changed: â€œThere was a visible dip in sales. We saw it right away.â€

Mr. Waltz is a committed supporter of the president, and he keeps a signed photograph from Mr. Trump in his office. He sells T-shirts with an AR-15 and words in ancient Greek that roughly translate to â€œcome and take them,â€ a reference to the purported reply of a Spartan king when told to lay down his weapons before a larger Persian army.

Demands for stricter gun laws grew again this year after the fatal shooting of 17 people by a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who introduced an assault weapons ban after the Las Vegas massacre last October, renewed her push after Februaryâ€™s campus attack.

Unlike past years, the efforts havenâ€™t spurred a big spike in firearm sales.

Pierce Sweeney, a 32-year-old chiropractor in San Antonio, Texas, said calls for bans or restrictions at one time prompted gun owners to buy more. Now, he said, many people have grown numb to such news.

Mr. Sweeney owns two AR-15s and seven other guns that he and his wife use for shooting targets and feral pigs. If he buys a new firearm, Mr. Sweeney said, he will sell one he already owns.

About 8% of all gun owners own 39% of the firearms in the U.S., according to a recent Harvard study. Many say they have enough for now, prompting gun makers to come up with new offerings.

At the NRA convention this spring, Springfield Armory introduced the sixth model in its two-year-old line of Saint AR-15-style rifles. The new â€œSaint AR-15 Pistolâ€ is a black pistol with an arm brace that looks like an AR-15. â€œIn any business, when it starts to slow down, people come out with new products,â€ said Steve McKelvain, president of Springfield Armory in Geneseo, Ill.

Palmetto State Armory showed off an AK-47-style rifle design that uses the same ammunition as an AR-15. â€œYouâ€™ve got to make it fresh because everyoneâ€™s already got an AR,â€ said Kris Vermillion, e-commerce content creator at the South Carolina-based manufacturer.

Springfield Armory has tried to appeal to younger and more diverse buyers. The company describes its AR-15s as â€œbuilt for the free and independentâ€ and â€œrepresents the next generation of Americaâ€™s personal defense rifle.â€

The companyâ€™s video has a hard-rock soundtrack and shows younger adultsâ€”men, women, white, African-Americanâ€”firing the gun in slow motion.

â€œIt appealed to a broader base,â€ said Mr. McKelvain, the Springfield president. â€œBut you run a fine line alienating the hard-core types.â€

""We are starting a flash mob in her support,"" read a Tweet from the agency's official Twitter account asking users to change their social-media profile pictures to a photo of Butina and tweet using the hashtag #FreeMariaButina.

The ministry also changed its profile image to a photo of the red-headed 29-year-old Butina.

Butina, who sits behind bars without bail in a federal holding facility, was a ""celebrity in Russia,"" according to US prosecutors.

A year after she moved to Moscow in 2010, she founded the pro-gun-rights group, The Right to Bear Arms, and quickly gained notoriety as an up-and-coming political influencer.

Just before she began showing up at National Rifle Association events in the US starting in 2014, she was featured in a splashy spread for GQ Russia. The magazine made her up to look like a stereotypical spy from a Hollywood movie. She posed in leather trench coats and spiked heels with slicked back hair and sultry black eyeliner while holding chrome-painted handguns.

373L46LKP8OQD76XEFAQ1R7LBX0JKD,Bank employees back in fatal shooting aftermath,"The husband of a bank executive who was shot at least 12 times publicly thanked police and emergency medical caregivers Monday for saving her life.

With yellow crime tape still sealing off the lobby entrance, employees returned to work at the downtown high-rise that is Fifth Third Bancorp's headquarters building, where four people, including the gunman, were killed last week. One gunshot victim was released from the hospital Monday, while the other remained hospitalized in fair condition.

The husband of Whitney Austin, a Fifth Third vice president and 37-year-old mother of two young children, offered public praise for police, first responders and hospital staffers.

""We are still unpacking how she survived the initial assault, especially after the shooter returned to fire more rounds into her body,"" Waller Austin said in a statement. He praised the bravery of the four Cincinnati Police officers â€” Jennifer Chilton, Gregory Toyeas, Antonio Etter, and Eric Kaminsky â€” who stopped the gunman.

""My wife is alive today because you refused to allow the shooter to continue his rampage â€” you are my heroes, and my children will know that they will have their mother and hold her, too, because of YOUR actions,"" he wrote. He said another officer, Al Staples, carried her to safety, comforting her and helping her call him before she was taken to the hospital.

He also thanked Fifth Third and co-workers for all their support and the community for prayers.

""I am not a religious man, and often question my faith or what God is, but I believe in prayer and 'miracle' is the only word I know that could accurately describe what happened to Whitney,"" Austin wrote. ""We are blessed. Thank you so much ... ""

A Cincinnati hospital said one of two people who survived gunshot wounds was released Monday afternoon.

University of Cincinnati Medical Center wouldn't identify the released patient, citing privacy restrictions. However, Austin's husband said earlier in the day that he had met with Fifth Third contractor Brian Sarver and his family and that Sarver was expected to be ready to go home soon.

Whitney Austin had arrived last week in critical condition. Waller Austin said she still has ""a long road ahead in her recovery.""

Some downtown workers took breaks to donate blood to the Hoxworth Blood Center of University of Cincinnati. The center regularly holds blood drives at the Fountain Square area that includes the building, but brought a second bus and extra staffers to respond to unusually strong response.

""It's such a cathartic thing for people to do,"" said Jim Tinker, a recruitment director for Hoxworth. He said supervisors in several nearby businesses were giving employees time off to give blood.

Some Fifth Third employees were signing up to donate, but they declined to comment.

Stacie Haas, a spokeswoman for the Cincinnati-based regional bank, said counselors were available for employees. She said Fifth Third has some 1,900 employees and contractors in the 30-story building, which hosts other businesses including food shops.

A Fifth Third finance manager and two contractors were killed Thursday .

Omar Enrique Santa Perez, 29, was shooting randomly in the lobby until quick-responding police shot him. Police said he had some 250 rounds of ammunition for his legally purchased 9 mm handgun.

Austin said he and his wife, a native of Louisville, Kentucky, are committed to doing what they can to ""protect innocent folks from senseless gun violence.""

Police said Santa Perez never worked at the building and searches of his apartment and vehicle haven't unveiled a motive.

""Nothing is really standing out,"" Cincinnati Police Lt. Steve Saunders said Monday. He said investigators ""have a lot of things"" remaining to study.

""Cincy Strong"" messages and bouquets of flowers were placed along the square's namesake fountain. The square often hosts a variety of community gatherings including concerts and food trucks.

Melissa and Ernie Bornstein, Los Angeles Dodgers fans from South Lake Tahoe, California, were in town to see baseball's Dodgers play the Cincinnati Reds. They were drawn to the fountain.

""We thought this has to be where what we heard about happened,"" she said. ""It's tragic.""

The appeal by the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, was made in a phone call, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. The Department of Justice has charged the woman, Maria Butina, with acting as an unregistered agent of Russia while attending conventions of the National Rifle Association and gaining access to conservative circles in an effort to influence powerful Republicans.

Moscow has mounted a vigorous effort on behalf of Ms. Butina. On Thursday, the Foreign Ministry began a social media campaign on its Twitter account, declaring that it was mobilizing a digital â€œflash mobâ€ to demand her release.

3QTFNPMJC70HLSW4TE5SHDCFO2WZNL,Nolte -- WATCH: David Hogg Asks Canadians to Interfere in U.S. Elections,"Anti-gun activist David Hogg made a fool of himself last week as he urged Canadians to donate to American political campaigns, which is against the law.

The 18-year-old Parkland student and anti-Second Amendment extremist was attending a rally with Michael Moore and apparently forgot which country he was in:

He launched his rant by asking an audience of Canadians, â€œWhoâ€™s ready to save America?â€ After some polite applause, the still oblivious Hogg mustered on.

â€œWhoâ€™s ready to make America the country that we say it is on paper and make it the actual country that it wants to be?â€

More politely awkward applause.

At this point, Hogg seems confused, like he cannot figure out why his usual applause lines are getting such a tepid response. Still apparently unaware of where he is, Hogg continued.

â€œI think the most important thing to realize, however, is the problems that we face in a country.â€

Hogg struggled on, talking about American problems, like the water in Flint, Michigan, and â€œmass incarceration.â€

Seated next to him during this whole time, Michael Moore tried not to look embarrassed.

After listing a bunch of American â€œproblems,â€ Hogg then summoned up the gusto to tell a room full of Canadians, â€œTurn that shame into your vote!â€

After an awkward silence, the porch lights finally came on, and Hogg added, â€œIf youâ€™re not Canadian!â€

Stumbling around embarrassed, Hogg then turned to Moore and said, â€œI think Canadians can donate to political campaigns in the United States.â€

Moore shook his head â€œno.â€

â€œThey canâ€™t?â€ a disappointed Hogg said before things got really awkward. â€œWell, uh, vote here!â€

After some more awkwardness, after it became clear Hogg was not going to dig his own way out of this, Moore took away his microphone.

Later at the rally, Hogg again tried to recover his dignity but did so by telling a lie about the NRA. Whatâ€™s more, after urging Canadians to interfere in American elections, Hogg resurrected the Russian Collusion Hoax.

â€œThe IRS, if youâ€™re watching on Facebook, why arenâ€™t you auditing the President of the United States, who likely got $30 million from Russia via the NRA.â€

This is Hogg again spreading fake news and flat-out conspiracy theories. There is no allegation the NRA received $30 million from Russia. Hogg is pulling this out of thin air, out of his hat.

There were reports the NRA received no more than $2,500 from a few people with Russian addresses, but those donations were completely legal.

This is not the first time Hogg spread conspiracy theories in public. In February, while appearing with fellow conspiracy theorist Brian Stelter on the far-left CNN, Hogg spewed a bunch of wild-eyed nonsense about the NRA and firearms.

Naturally, Stelter, who knew that none of this was true, said nothing.",https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/09/10/watch-david-hogg-asks-canadians-interfere-us-elections/,"['Democratic', 'Republican', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Republican']","['2', '4', '1', '1', '1']"

10:50 a.m.

The family of a West Virginia man killed in the shooting at video game tournament in Florida says he was a dedicated family man with ""big dreams.""

A statement posted on Facebook by relatives of 28-year-old Taylor Robertson of Giles, West Virginia, says he was an ""extraordinary man"" whose world revolved around his wife and their young son. The statement says Robertson's goal as a professional gamer ""was always to better himself for his family.""

Robertson was a gaming champion who competed in ""Madden NFL"" football franchise tournaments under the gamer tag Spotmeplzzz. He won the Madden Classic tournament in 2016.

Authorities say Robertson and 22-year-old Elijah Clayton of Woodland Hills, California, were killed Sunday when a fellow gamer opened fire at the ""Madden"" tournament in Jacksonville.

___

9:20 a.m.

Experts in Maryland say the video gaming gunman's history of mental illness apparently wouldn't have stopped him from buying guns before he killed two people and wounded 10 and then killed himself at a tournament in Florida.

Maryland law prevents someone from passing a background check to buy guns if they were either involuntarily committed for any period of time or voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility for at least 30 consecutive days. David Katz was hospitalized at least twice, but Daniel Webster, who directs the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, says his treatment wasn't enough to disqualify him.

Maryland State troopers are responsible for investigating gun purchases in Katz's home state, but they're not talking for now to avoid interfering with the investigation in Jacksonville.

___

12:45 a.m.

Court records show that a gunman specifically targeted fellow gamers at a Florida tournament.

Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams told a news conference Monday that 24-year-old David Katz, of Baltimore, ""walked past patrons who were in other parts of the business and focused his attention on the gamers.""

Katz fatally shot himself after killing the two men and wounding 10 others Sunday inside a pizzeria and bar that were hosting a ""Madden NFL 19"" tournament.

Williams said that Katz carried two handguns, including one equipped with a laser sight, into the tournament venue but only fired one of them.

The sheriff's office identified the dead as 22-year-old Elijah Clayton of Woodland Hills, California, and 28-year-old Taylor Robertson of Giles, West Virginia.",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/28/latest-victim-remembered-as-dedicated-family-man.html,"['Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['5', '2', '5', '4', '3']"

In this advertisement, the narrator says Vukmir ""wrote a letter seeking leniency for a fellow state legislator convicted of sexual assault"" and also accuses her of some other, less sensational misdeeds. More on that letter here.

Gubernatorial

â— MI-Gov: Uh â€¦ okay. In his latest campaign ad, GOP Lt. Gov. Brian Calley bangs away on the piano as he and a band play for an enthralled audience, including outgoing Gov. Rick Snyder himself. Calley explains, ""It wasn't long ago that Michigan was singing the blues""â€”but thanks to the efforts of the Snyder-Calley team, the economy is zipping and, apparently, everyone's humming a happier tune now. Well, it's different, at least.

â— MN-Gov: Well, this isn't a good sign for Tim Pawlenty. Though he holds huge advantages in money and name recognition, the former governor apparently feels the need to go negative on his opponent in next month's GOP primary, Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson, in his first TV spot of the race, accusing him of supporting tax hikes and Obamacare. The only poll we've seen, taken for a conservative website, found Pawlenty with a giant 54-20 lead on Johnson last month, so either Pawlenty is playing it super-safe or is worried that grassroots enthusiasm on the right could propel Johnson to an upset.

â— TN-Gov: State House Speaker Beth Harwell's newest ad features a trio of kids, dressed up as her GOP primary rivals, all squabbling over a kitchen table (as kids, of course, are wont to do). Harwell then touts her accomplishments in the legislatureâ€”a rare instance of a Republican office-holder actually acknowledging that they, well, hold officeâ€”saying she lowered taxes and ""outlawed sanctuary cities,"" with a narrator concluding by calling her the ""adult in the room."" It doesn't seem like voters in this primary are all that interested in Harwell's message of maturity, though, as every recent poll has shown her in fourth place.

â— WY-Gov: On behalf of Wyoming PBS and the state's public radio network, the University of Wyoming has conducted a new poll of the Aug. 21 GOP primary for the state's open gubernatorial race. The survey finds state Treasurer Mark Gordon in front with 19 percent, while businessman Sam Galeotos takes 14, attorney Harriet Hageman is at 11, and physician Taylor Haynes is at 10. As for billionaire megadonor Foster Friess, he's in fifth place with just 7 percent, even though he's been on the airwaves since May.

Niermann concludes, ""No matter what Trump, the Republicans, and the NRA say, we need common-sense gun reform, and we need it now.""

â— OH-12: Like his allies at the Congressional Leadership Fund, Republican Troy Balderson is now also airing TV ads attacking his Democratic opponent in next month's special election, Danny O'Connor, by trying to link him with Nancy Pelosi. This time, though, Balderson also throws in a local bogeyman, former Gov. Ted Strickland, calling O'Connor a ""Strickland protÃ©gÃ©"" and claiming he wants to ""eliminate the middle class tax cut and ruin our economy again."" As we've noted previously, O'Connor says he would not support Pelosi for House speaker, and similar attacks on Democrat Conor Lamb (who took the same tack) failed to stop him in the special election for Pennsylvania's 18th District earlier this year.

Meanwhile, Politico reports that CLF is headed back into the fray with a new $203,000 television buy this week, though there's no copy of any ad available yet. The NRCC has also added $254,000 to its own TV reservations for the final two weeks of the race, which takes place Aug. 7.

â— WI-01: For some reason, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC closely associated with retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan, decided to poll next month's Democratic primary in the race to fill Ryan's seat. Somewhat unexpectedly, the survey, which was conducted by Republican pollster Remington Research, finds Janesville School Board member Cathy Myers with a slight 34-33 edge on ironworker Randy Bryce, who has achieved national attention thanks to his blue-collar appeal and landed a spot on the DCCC's ""Red to Blue"" list highlighting top-tier candidates.

But while Bryce has raised many millions of dollars by smartly capitalizing on the man who was his opponent for most of the cycle, women candidates have performed extremely well in Democratic primaries this year, and Myers herself has raised credible sums of money that would be sizable in any other race. An upset therefore is not unimaginable. However, we have no other surveys to compare this one to, and it's also possible the CLF is just trying to screw with the DCCC.",https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/7/13/1780058/-Morning-Digest-GOP-congressman-bought-a-yacht-on-day-he-voted-to-give-himself-2-million-tax-cut,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['2', '2', '1', '1', '3']"
34R0BODSP2HFK8Z2TRVT2MBB9OF5ED,"Ten Years after Heller decision, gun rights continue trend toward more freedom, not more gun control","The cornerstone gun-rights decision, Heller v. D.C., the case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Bill of Rights is indeed an individual right, has reached its 10th anniversary.

Over the last decade this decision has helped to propel a cultural shift on how guns are viewed in America. Its ramifications have boosted freedom in too many states and in too many ways to list. Nevertheless, its affects are misunderstood.

Given the way that much of the media treats issues related to guns, and given that Heller and the subsequent McDonald decisions were 5-4 votes by the high court (a divide the court likely still holds today), it might seem like common sense to think America is closely divided on this issue.

This is the view CNN, The Washington Post and more are pushing. The left sees the publicâ€™s acceptance of gun bans and other gun controls as slow but inevitable social change. They think it will follow the same type of public opinion shift that the gay-marriage issue went through.

They are wrong because in this case they are doing the illiberal thing; they are trying to reduce rights and to undo long-held American freedom.

If the left was right about even some of their talking points on guns and violence they might have a chance of deceiving a majority of Americans into voting away their freedom, but they arenâ€™t.

The number of homicides in the U.S. has fallen precipitously in America over the last half century as the number of firearms in civilian hands has risen. Most murders today occur in the areas with the strictest gun-control laws.

The left has also gone way off the factual rails in its quest to ban so-called â€œassault weapons.â€ (I say so-called because there is no definition for â€œassault weaponâ€ outside of how a particular law defines them.)

In 2000 Al Gore found he miscalculated when he made gun control a central plank in his push for the presidency. It was a position that arguably cost him his home state and with it the election. Hillary Clinton made the same mistake, costing her votes in Pennsylvania and the Upper Midwest.

As they demonize â€œscary lookingâ€ semiautomatic rifles they miss the basic fact that year after year the FBIâ€™s Uniform Crime Reporting finds that rifles of all types are used in less than 3 percent of murders.

The anti-gun left also avoids addressing the basic fact that AR-15-type rifles have been sold to U.S. citizens since 1963, the same year the U.S. military adopted the M16. Meanwhile, â€œmainstream newsâ€ reporters donâ€™t know or they wonâ€™t report the fact that semiautomatic rifles have been sold to sportsmen and more since the very early 20th century by companies like Remington and Winchester.

Clearly the problem that a few terrorists and some mentally ill people are attempting, and at times succeeding, to accomplish mass murder isnâ€™t the fault of riflesâ€”or of vans and trucks for that matterâ€”but is a more complex problem we need to focus in on to solve as best we can.

The left isnâ€™t even right about the so-called â€œgun lobby.â€

The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the trade association for firearms manufacturers (full disclosure: Iâ€™ve done some contract work for the NSSF), spends a lot of time and resources advocating for gun-safety programs. (Iâ€™m not using the term â€œgun safetyâ€ as loosely as gun-control proponents do today, as they use it as a synonym for â€œgun controlâ€; instead, I am using it as the dictionary defines the terms.)

The NSSF has joined the National Safety Councilâ€™s designation of June as â€œNational Safety Month,â€ for example, by promoting its â€œProject Childsafe,â€ its â€œOwn It? Respect it. Secure it.â€ program and other initiatives to try to further reduce accidents and other deaths related to firearms. Such efforts have been working, as the number of accidental deaths is a fraction of what it once was.

People have noticed all this and vote accordingly.

In 2000 Al Gore found he miscalculated when he made gun control a central plank in his push for the presidency. It was a position that arguably cost him his home state and with it the election. Hillary Clinton made the same mistake, which cost her blue collar votes in Pennsylvania and the Upper Midwest.

Now a decade after the Heller decision pro-gun laws have swept through many states. A dozen states now even have â€œconstitutionalâ€ or â€œpermitlessâ€ carry for handguns. There are over 100 million gun owners in America and more than 16 million people have permits to carry concealed handguns (up from about 1 million in the mid-1980s). A recent United Nationsâ€™ Small Arms Survey found that American civilians now have 393 million firearms (46 percent of all of the guns in civilian hands in the world).

Clearly more and more Americans are taking their Second Amendment rights into their own hands.

So no, the cultural shift isnâ€™t toward gun control. It is clearly moving toward greater freedom.",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/06/26/ten-years-after-heller-decision-gun-rights-continue-trend-toward-more-freedom-not-more-gun-control.html,"['Republican', 'Neutral', 'Republican', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Republican']","['5', '5', '5', '5', '5']"
3XD2A6FGFOCZVE6WXCSF3JKSWYFS9A,Andrew Cuomo is now at war with the Bill of Rights,"Gov. Cuomo's lawyers will be in federal court in Albany next month, when they'll try to get a judge to dismiss the lawsuit against him by America's largest civil-rights organization.

The group is the National Rifle Association, which is asking a federal court to halt the governor's efforts to use financial regulations to drive the gun-rights group out of business here. Think of it as the first court test of what could be called the ""Cuomo doctrine"": the governor's vow that ""extreme conservatives"" have ""no place in the state of New York.""

Cuomo first declared his doctrine in a radio interview in January 2014. He railed against ""extreme conservatives who are 'right to life,' 'pro assault weapon,' 'anti-gay.'â€Š"" Cuomo didn't say whether he meant to include in his list of deplorables all Catholics, say, or Muslims, or Orthodox Jews.

What had really set Cuomo off was Republican opposition to his gun-control measures. He was infuriated that, after Sandy Hook, some objected to tightening already-strict New York gun laws.

Fair enough, one might say. The governor of New York is entitled to have a view on guns, to differ with the NRA and to join robustly in the debate over what to do about gun violence.

In April of this year, though, state regulators told insurers and banks they oversee to look at their relationships with gun-rights groups. They warned of ""reputational risks"" in their ""dealings"" with the NRA.

""Nice little business you have here,"" the state seemed to be saying to banks and insurers. ""It'd be a shame if something happened to it."" The state has left little doubt that it was loaded for bear.

In May, regulators extracted fines of $1.3 million from Chubb and $7 million from Lockton Affinity, both involved with the NRA's ""Carry Guard"" insurance for lawful gun-owners. A Carry Guard Web site says the insurance offers ""protection against civil liability, the cost to defend against civil and criminal legal actions and immediate access to attorney referrals.""

It also covers bail, some legal fees, ""lawful firearm replacement"" and compensation while in court, among other costs ""resulting from the use of a legally possessed firearm -- including an act of self-defense.""

Cuomo claims Carry Guard covers ""intentional wrongdoing."" In May, he was sued by the NRA for ""viewpoint discrimination"" against it and the law-abiding gun-owners it represents.

The NRA accuses Cuomo of running a campaign of ""selective prosecution, backroom exhortations and public threats."" It claims the government seeks to halt its defense of the Second Amendment.

""Simply put,"" the NRA alleges, Cuomo and New York regulators ""made it clear to banks and insurers that it is bad business in New York to do business with the NRA.""

What's particularly shocking is that state regulators have failed to confine themselves to financial matters. New York's financial regulators are lecturing financial institutions on politics.

""Passionate, courageous and articulate young people,"" the state Department of Financial Services wrote to insurers after Parkland, ""can no longer be ignored.""

What's next -- David Hogg for state superintendent of financial services?

No wonder the NRA is arguing that it's being subjected to viewpoint discrimination. And no wonder Cuomo &amp; Co. want the NRA's lawsuit to be dismissed without being heard.

Cuomo last week filed a motion to have the case dismissed on the ground that it fails to state a claim. It certainly poses a risk to his hope to seize the high ground as he preps a run for president.

Which gets back to the Cuomo doctrine. If Cuomo can cripple a 147-year-old civil-rights organization in New York, what would he be prepared to do as president?

Could he someday deploy financial regulators against ""extreme conservatives"" who hold religious views on same-sex marriage and abortion -- and shelter under the same Bill of Rights as the NRA?",https://nypost.com/2018/08/08/andrew-cuomo-is-now-at-war-with-the-bill-of-rights/,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Republican', 'Democratic', 'Neutral']","['5', '5', '4', '5', '3']"

3DWGDA5POGMXY1K5NUIRZ0MGXQM1VG,ATF: Jacksonville Gunman Acquired His Firearms 'Legally',"On Monday the ATF revealed that Jacksonville gunman David Katz had two handguns at the time of his attack and he acquired both of those legally in Baltimore, Maryland.

ABC News reports that Jacksonville Sheriff Michael Williams said Katz was armed with two handguns â€” a .45 caliber and a 9mm, when he opened fire on fellow gamers at the Madden Tournament. However, Williams added that Katz only used one of the guns in the attack.

The ATF revealed that Katz bought both guns â€œwithin the month of August in Baltimore from a licensed dealer.â€ This means Katz passed a background check to acquire his firearms, and it also means he complied with pre-purchase requirements for would-be handgun purchasers in Maryland.

Katz now joins a growing list of public attackers who have acquired their guns via background checks. That list includes:

Parkland high school attacker (February 14, 2018)

Texas church attacker (November 5, 2017)

Las Vegas attacker (October 1, 2017)

the Alexandria attacker (June 14, 2017))

Orlando attacker (June 12, 2016)

the UCLA gunman (June 1, 2016))

the San Bernardino attackers (December 2, 2015)

the Colorado Springs attacker (October 31, 2015)

the Umpqua Community College attacker (October 1, 2015)

Alison Parkerâ€™s attacker (August 26, 2015)

the Lafayette movie theater attacker (July 23, 2015)

the Chattanooga attacker (July 16, 2015)

the alleged Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal attacker (Jun 17, 2015)

the Muhammad Carton Contest attackers (May 3, 2014)

the Las Vegas cop killers (June 9, 2015)

the Santa Barbara attacker (May 23, 2014)

the Fort Hood attacker (April 2, 2014)

the Arapahoe High School attacker (December 13, 2013)

the D.C. Navy Yard attacker (September 16, 2013)

the Aurora movie theater attacker (July 20, 2012)

Gabby Giffordsâ€™ attacker (January 8, 2011)

the Fort Hood attacker (November 5, 2009)

the Virginia Tech attacker (April 16, 2007), and many others.

Following news of the Jacksonville shooting, but before all the facts were in, gun control proponent David Hogg took to Twitter to urge Congress to require background checks on all gun sales:

Hey @SpeakerRyan â€“ Just a reminder that 97% of Americans support universal background checks for all gun purchases. Why won't you #AllowTheVote? â€” Andrew Weinstein (@Weinsteinlaw) August 27, 2018

Jacksonville is a yet another reason to oppose expanding background checks, inasmuch as it is demonstrable that such checks pose no hindrance to would-be criminals. They simply create more red tape for law-abiding citizens to wade through in order to acquire guns for self-defense.

375VSR8FVXR20QOWMLM9QXHPPZLRZ1,The Fox News employees hired by Trump,"President Trump has long been a Fox News fan and is a loyal consumer of the network's programming -- as president, he's given over 20 interviews to the cable news network, which the New York Times pointed out is two-thirds of his television interviews since he's been in office. Amid the sea of ""fake news"" the president complains about, Mr. Trump praises Fox News for its ""amazing reporting."" It should also come as no surprise that he has even mined the ranks of Fox News to hire talent for his administration. In fact, he's likely to announce soon that his new communications director will be a former co-president of Fox News, Bill Shine.

Here's a look at some notable former Fox News employees and contributors the Trump administration has hired:

John Bolton

National security adviser



Former Fox News contributor



Bolton took his position as national security adviser on March 22, replacing H.R. McMaster. He previously served as ambassador to the United Nations under former President George W. Bush and served in the Reagan administration.

Heather Nauert

Under secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs/State Department spokesperson



Former correspondent and co-anchor on ""The Big Story""

Nauert began her career with Fox News in 1998, where she worked until 2005 before leaving and hopping around other news organizations. She returned to the network in 2007. While she's worked in journalism and has some acting experience, she had never worked in politics until the Trump administration tapped her to be State Department spokesperson.

Mercedes Schlapp

White House strategic communications director

Former Fox News contributor

Schlapp began contributing to Fox News after her work as director of specialty media during the Bush administration. She worked on both his 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns, founded lobbying firm Cove Strategies and served as a board member of the National Rifle Association.

Tony Sayegh

Treasury Department spokesman



Former Fox News commentator



Sayegh has been both a regular contributor and guest of multiple shows airing on Fox News. Although he now represents the Treasury Department under the Trump administration, he still appears on the network.

K.T. McFarland

Former deputy national security adviser; nominated



Former Fox News contributor



During her time with Fox News, McFarland wrote a weekly column for the network's website and appeared on-air as a national security commentator. She was deputy national security adviser while Michael Flynn was national security adviser, before being forced out by his successor, H.R. McMaster. President Trump also nominated her to be ambassador to Singapore, but McFarland withdrew when questions arose about her knowledge of Flynn's conversations with then-Russian envoy Sergey Kislyak. In the Reagan administration, McFarland was a speechwriter for the Defense Department and later a Pentagon spokesperson.

Scott Brown

Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa

Former Fox News contributor

Brown joined Fox News in 2013, after he lost his Massachusetts Senate seat to Elizabeth Warren. He was hired as an on-air contributor and was also an on-call host for ""Fox and Friends.""

President Trump named him ambassador to New Zealand in April 2017.

Richard Grenell

Ambassador to Germany

Former Fox News contributor



Grenell, nominated to be ambassador to Germany in Sept. 2017, commented on media and foreign affairs on Fox News as a contributor in 2009. Grenell also served as spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the U.N. for seven years, and he served as the foreign affairs spokesman for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign for a short time, but reportedly resigned after social conservatives questioned whether someone who was openly gay could work for a Republican presidential campaign.

John D. McEntee

Former special assistant to the president and personal aide to the president



Former Fox News production assistant



McEntee was Mr. Trump's personal aide and body man during the campaign and for a year in the White House. McEntee, 28, started his job as a production assistant for Fox News in 2015, focusing on the network's social media presence.

Georgette Mosbacher

Awaiting confirmation as ambassador to Poland



Former Fox News contributor



Mosbacher was a Fox News contributor before she was nominated to be ambassador to Poland in February. Mosbacher has a long history as a prominent Republican donor, socialite and cosmetics businesswoman, and she has been a friend of Mr. Trump's for decades.

Anthony Scaramucci

Former White House communications director



Former Fox Business Network contributor



Scaramucci's time in the White House was very brief -- he served at the White House communications director for just 10 days before Mr. Trump fired him. Scaramucci appeared on Fox Business Network as a contributor and hosted a show called ""Wall Street Week.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fox-news-employees-hired-by-trump/,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Republican', 'Strongly Democratic']","['1', '1', '1', '1', '1']"
3Q7TKIAPOUSOURONPJ0GDTPNVGADL4,Gun rights activists hand out high-capacity magazines at Vermont rally,"Gun rights activists were handing out high-capacity magazines at a rally outside the Vermont State House on Saturday to protest new legislation that would ban them and increase gun control in the state.

Hundreds of protesters gathered to urge Republican Gov. Phil Scott not to sign a new bill that would ban high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, expand background checks for private gun sales and raise the legal age for gun purchases.

The measure was approved by the State House earlier this week and then again by the Senate on Friday in a 17-13 vote.

Protesters were handed nearly 1,200 high-capacity magazines, which hold up to 30 rounds of ammunition. Standard capacity magazines are those that are sold with, and designed to operate in, firearms as sold from the manufacturer, according to an email from Congressionalsportsmen.org.

The email said these magazines ""can far exceed 10 rounds - up to and including 30 round magazines that are typically sold with many popular semi-automatic rifles. In reality, the same magazines that are branded as â€œhigh capacityâ€ by some, are in fact standard on many firearm platforms.""

OUTCRY FROM GUN ADVOCATES AFTER YOUTUBE BLOCKS VIDEOS ON FIREARMS ASSEMBLY, SALE

If the bill is signed by Scott, those who already own high-capacity magazines will be allowed to keep them.

Scott has indicated that he intends to sign the bill, and though he understands the disappointment of some in Vermont, he has faith that they will â€œget accustomed to the new normal.â€

â€œI think at the end of the day,"" he said, ""theyâ€™ll soon learn that what we have proposed, whatâ€™s being passed at this time, doesnâ€™t intrude upon the Second Amendment. It doesnâ€™t take away guns, and I believe that we will get accustomed to the new normal, which is trying to address this underlying violence that we are seeing across the nation.â€

The extensive gun legislation package came after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting on Feb. 14, in which 17 people were killed by a young gunman.

Airbnb's policy includes bans for certain criminal convictions. (Photo: Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images)

Airbnb doesnâ€™t care about people like me.

I learned this the hard way a few months ago when I tried to find accommodation in Washington, D.C.

After chaperoning two busloads of youth from New York City for the March for Our Lives, I decided to stay a couple more days. The other chaperones agreed to ride the bus back to New York City with the kids, and I logged into my new Airbnb account for the first time to find a place to spend the night. Soon after locating and booking a suitable place, I received an email from Airbnb stating:

""Upon review, and given information uncovered pursuant to online public records, we have determined that it is in the best interest of Airbnb, and for the users on our site, to deactivate your account.""

COLUMN: Best way to respond to foolish 911 calls â€” stop sending armed cops

COLUMN: Syrian refugees like me don't want to depend on government. We want to contribute to society.

Airbnb confirmed what I already knew: The reason for the company deactivating my account was my conviction for attempted robbery, and first- and second-degree assault, 16 years ago.

Airbnbâ€™s website identifies certain criminal convictions as a reason to disqualify people from using its service. Now, after years of healing and loving work, I am confronted, yet again, with the cruel reality that society makes people like me keep paying for mistakes far beyond our prison term.

I am exhausted fighting this battle, but I know that if this injustice goes unchallenged, the approximately 20 million un-incarcerated people in the United States with felony convictions will continue to live in the shadows â€” punished eternally for the mistakes of our youth.

In 1999, when I was 19, I was one of several people who participated in the armed robbery of a bakery. The heist ended with two men (the owner and manager) getting killed and others getting injured. I was the lookout. But my conviction carried the full weight of all the crimes committed that day.

One 2012 Bureau of Justice Statistics survey indicated that as many as 100 million adults in the United States and some of its territories â€” or nearly a third of the total population â€” have a criminal record of some sort. For many, as The Atlantic notes, we are also being perpetually punished for what amounts to existing in the wrong skin or community.

Since my arrest, I have wholly dedicated myself to a life of service and love.

While in prison, I co-founded How Our Lives Link Altogether, a youth mentoring program. Once on the outside, I helped run Youth Organizing to Save Our Streets, a group that specializes in ending gun violence and using mediation. My podcast, Decarcerated, highlights the journeys, successes and struggles of people with criminal convictions. Ebony magazine named me one of the 100 most inspiring leaders in the black community in 2015.

Yet, I am still denied the simple ability to host or book a room with Airbnb.

I can certainly understand the apprehension. If I were renting out a space, I would want to know everything about my tenant as well. But I would also take into account how they've changed their lives. How long should people pay for mistakes of their past? When is enough enough?

Does Airbnb or Trooly, the background check company purchased by Airbnb, have an algorithm to account for people like me who have paid their debt to society?

Apparently, Airbnb does not want to share its share service with some people who have had criminal convictions, regardless of how long ago the conviction occurred or what people have done since their release.

This policy is not just morally wrong, it also conflicts with an April 2016 federal guidance of the Fair Housing Act, which articulates that a housing provider violates the FHA if its policy â€œimposes a blanket prohibition on any person with any conviction record â€” no matter when the conviction occurred, what the underlying conduct entailed, or what the convicted person has done since then.â€

Airbnb's policy choices could be turning back the clock on discrimination, especially when it comes to people of color. A Harvard field experiment called Racial Discrimination in the Sharing Economy found that â€œwhile rental markets have achieved significant reductions in discrimination in recent decades, our results suggest that Airbnbâ€™s current design choices facilitate discrimination and raise the possibility of erasing some of these civil rights gains.â€

In a world where discrimination along color lines has long since been outlawed, people with criminal convictions have become the easiest demographic to dismiss with one brush. With African-Americans incarcerated disproportionately to the overall population, Airbnb is implying that there are certain people it is willing to quickly eliminate from its franchise.

Our economy is moving steadily toward sharing. Itâ€™s high time that we do away with any policies or technologies that effectively impose blanket bans on people with criminal convictions. We must overhaul these policies and build transparency into information-gathering processes so that marginalized people do not experience indefinite social exclusion.

Letâ€™s start with Airbnb, whose practices are antithetical to its own stated mission.

The second paragraph of the Airbnb nondiscrimination policy reads: â€œThe Airbnb community is committed to building a world where people from every background feel welcomed and respected, no matter how far they have traveled from home.â€

That policy seems to apply to everyone except people like me and millions of others living with certain convictions in America.

I call on Airbnb to change this wrong and immoral policy today, and for others to join me in urging the company to change course.

Marlon Peterson is a writer, social justice advocate and host of the podcast Decarcerated, which highlights the successful journeys of people who have been incarcerated.

Editor's Note: Airbnb has confirmed that Marlon Peterson was banned for life because of his criminal record. While the company has stated that it will not publish or disclose its full policy, representatives did explain that the policy does not include bans for minor drug offenses, including marijuana possession. The policy includes bans from seven years to a lifetime for other criminal convictions.

Greg is here to champion this administration... NOT! Greg even uses the word â€œTreasonâ€, and so can you! We are getting a clearer idea of what â€œKompromatâ€ means as well. The West Wing revolts, James Comey says â€œVote Democraticâ€, thoughts and prayers go out to the Gop, but will any of them really do anything? Probably... not! Joan offers a simple test for Republican patriotism. Supporter of Russian 2A rights, NRA shill, Russian Spy Maria Butina, enjoys taking Americaâ€™s backdoor to power, the same way Evangelical Christians like to go. Republicans want a little privacy with their dark money exchanges. Donaldâ€™s and Tucker Carlsonâ€™s heel spurs act up at even the thought of protecting NATO member Montenegro were they to decide to step under Russiaâ€™s boot again. Trump is Russiaâ€™s, and therefore so are Trumpâ€™s assets, for instance, Brett Kavanaugh. Russian operatives have already quoted Kavanaugh to defend against the Mueller investigation. Kavanaugh is set to put the final nail in Congressâ€™ power to investigate Trump. What can we do about all of this? Well, voting will help. Voting is not enough, though.

On March 23, 2018, Breitbart News reported Citibankâ€™s new corporate gun controls which bar gun store customers from selling â€œhigh-capacityâ€ magazines and require those same stores to refuse long gun sales to 18 to 20-year-old Americans, even though it is legal to sell long guns to 18 to 20-year-olds.

On March 30, 2018, Breitbart News reported that Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), which has $634 billion in assets, joined the gun control push by urging investors to cut ties with the NRA.

On June 26, 2018, Breitbart News reported that Stripe and Inuit were refusing to process payments from gun makers and NBC Los Angeles reported that Bank of America has chosen to refuse â€œfinancing to companies that make AR-style guns.â€

Additionally, over a dozen corporations completely severed relations with the NRA following the February 14, 2018, Parkland high school shooting, and on April 21, 2018, Breitbart News reported that YETI coolers cut ties with the NRA Foundation.

In this climate of anti-Second Amendment hysteria, we now have Facebook seeking financial information on bank customers. Breitbart News reports that the information sought includes account balances and transactions.

What happens if Facebook learns that certain Facebook users do business with gun manufacturers or ammunition makers?

What if Facebook learns that certain users invest in 3D printersâ€“which could be used to print firearm partsâ€“or they invest in major firearm companies like Smith &amp; Wesson or Sturm, Ruger, and Co.?

What if Facebook learns that certain users manufacture â€œhigh capacityâ€ magazines?

Facebook has not said it will sever ties over any these things, but they have not spoken against severing ties either. So these questions must be asked in the climate of corporate gun control.

3LOJFQ4BOYXDAL654JOFYTC86PHKD2,Maria Butina makes Trump's Russia utterances impossible to stomach,"The yawning gap between the world as it exists and the world as President Trump sees it was on vivid display Wednesday.

A few minutes after noon, reporters in the White House were being ushered out of a Cabinet meeting they had been allowed to witness. One called out a question: â€œIs Russia still targeting the U.S., Mr. President?â€

Trump replied with a shake of the head: â€œThank you very much. No.â€

â€œNo? You donâ€™t believe that to be the case?â€

â€œNo,â€ Trump repeated (though his spokeswoman would try her best later to undo it).

Just over an hour later, a striking young woman, with orange hair and a matching prison jumpsuit, was led, scowling, into Courtroom Four of the U.S. District Courthouse at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. According to the Justice Department â€” Trumpâ€™s Justice Department â€” this woman, Maria Butina, is a Russian national who, until her arrest Sunday, â€œengaged in a years-long conspiracy to work covertly in the United States as an undeclared agent of the Russian Federation.â€ Her â€œcovert influence campaign,â€ directed by a senior Russian government official to advance Russiaâ€™s interests, involved international coordination, planning and deceit.

How is it possible that Trump can assert that Russia is not targeting the United States â€” two days after he suggested it didnâ€™t interfere with the 2016 election â€” while just a few blocks away, his own administration is prosecuting a Russian for targeting the United States?

Butina did not speak but ran her hands through her long hair as her lawyer said she would be pleading not guilty. She sat, conferring quietly with lawyers, as prosecutors expanded on a written court filing packed with allegations right out of â€œThe Americansâ€: a duplicitous romantic relationship, an offer of sex for employment, a wire transfer to Russia and a possible plan to flee the country or be â€œexfiltratedâ€ by Russian intelligence.

Butina isnâ€™t part of special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIâ€™s portfolio (regular Justice Department prosecutors are handling the case), and her alleged activities, trying to gain access to American leaders through the National Rifle Association, Conservative Political Action Conference and National Prayer Breakfast, were relatively anodyne. But unlike the Russians indicted by Mueller for hacking the Democratic National Committee and for running a troll farm, Butina is in U.S. custody. Here is possible Russian political meddling â€” in the flesh.

In court, DOJ prosecutor Erik Kenerson claimed Butina has ties to the Russian intelligence services and oligarchs and was considered a covert Russian agent by a senior Russian official, believed based on descriptions in the complaint to be Alexander Torshin, deputy director of Russiaâ€™s central bank.

The 29-year-old Russian, attending classes at American University, was in a relationship with â€œU.S. Person 1â€ â€” a person who matches the description of Paul Erickson, a 56-year-old Republican political operative â€” but prosecutors said Butina, in documents seized by the FBI, complained about living with him. They said she offered another person â€œsex in exchange for a position within a special interest organization.â€

Kenerson described her as an extreme flight risk, painting a spy-novel scenario of a Russian diplomatic car driving her to the border. (Butinaâ€™s lawyer, Robert Driscoll, conceding this theoretical possibility, asked the judge if he could consult with Russian consular officials in the courtroom.)

Kenerson displayed an FBI surveillance photo of her at a D.C. restaurant with a â€œsuspected Russian intelligence operative.â€ He also displayed a photo of Butina at the Capitol on Trumpâ€™s Inauguration Day, and described an exchange between the two: â€œYouâ€™re a daredevil girl,â€ Torshin said in response to the photo.

Replied Butina: â€œGood teachers!â€

Kenerson said Butina had told the Russian official she was â€œready for further orders.â€

With about 100 people â€” several speaking Russian â€” packing the courtroom, Driscoll argued that there were â€œcompletely innocent explanationsâ€ for Butinaâ€™s behavior and that â€œMs. Butina is not a proxy for any of the serious and substantial issues our country has with Russia now.â€

Whatever else Butina was, she was a savvy political actor. She believed in March 2015 that Republicans would win the White House, and that, to build â€œconstructive relationsâ€ with Republicans, she would use the NRA, which she described as the â€œcentral place and influenceâ€ in the GOP and â€œthe largest sponsor of the elections to the U.S. Congress.â€ She got to ask Trump about Russia during a 2015 town hall and meet Donald Trump Jr. at an NRA convention.

This is what makes Trumpâ€™s utterances about Russia impossible to stomach. On Wednesday, even before he claimed Russia isnâ€™t targeting America, Trump tweeted that people who â€œHATE the fact that I got along well with President Putinâ€ suffer from â€œTrump Derangement Syndrome.â€

No, what they hate is seeing Russia â€” still â€” infiltrating and undermining the American political process, and an American president who is willfully blind to it as he cozies up to the man responsible.

'Infowars followers will be pushed deeper down the conspiracy rabbit hole, and this controversy has just given Jones millions in free advertising.'

Social media companies (Facebook, YouTube, Apple and Spotify) removed Alex Jones' shows or pages from their platforms, citing breaches of policies against hate speech or graphic content. A roundup of opinion:

Making a martyr of Alex Jones

Social media companies targeted right-wing provocateur and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on Monday, removing his content from their platforms in what they call a crackdown on ""hate speech."" YouTube shut down The Alex Jones Channel, an account with nearly 2.5 million subscribers. Facebook removed four pages affiliated with Infowars, Jonesâ€™ media company, and also banned his personal page. Apple topped off the social media shutdown, scrubbing its iTunes platform of Jones' podcasts, as well.

This might sound like good news â€” after all, Jones is a reprehensible commentator who peddles in conspiracy theories, ranging from the ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy, which alleged Hillary Clinton ran a pedophilia ring out of a pizza shop, to the blatantly false idea that the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was faked.

But no matter how despicable Jones' commentary is, we should all be dismayed to see him censored on social media. Facebook, YouTube and others are private companies, so they arenâ€™t violating Jones' First Amendment rights. Nonetheless, they are stifling the spirit of free speech and â€” perhaps most important â€” censorship will only make Alex Jones a martyr among his fan base.

Jones is already encouraging his followers to stream his content directly from his website. Stripping his videos from other websites will only reinforce his conspiratorial narrative. Infowars followers will be pushed deeper down the conspiracy rabbit hole, and this controversy has just given Jones millions in free advertising. The objective was to lessen Jones' influence, but this censorship will prove to be self-defeating.

When a similar right-wing provocateur, Milo Yiannopoulos, visited the campus of the University of Massachusetts, he was set to speak to an audience of a few hundred college students. But after left-wing protests shut down his speech, more than 2.5 million watched the video online. When the white nationalist Richard Spencer visited the University of Florida, campus censorship turned his rally into national news.

Censorship doesnâ€™t work; it boomerangs back to bite us all. Even beyond that, we should be concerned to see social media companies wading into this murky territory. When internet monoliths start deciding which thought is acceptable in the name of ""hate speech,"" it puts us down a problematic path thatâ€™s sure to be abused. Anyone can call anything they disagree with hateful â€” will Facebook start banning pages for the National Rifle Association or Planned Parenthood?

A free and open internet is one where people get to decide for themselves whatâ€™s offensive, hateful or otherwise beyond the pale. If social media companies really want to rid the world of hateful hacks such as Alex Jones, the best thing they can do is ignore them.

What our readers are saying

Professional news media and social media have an obligation to remove trash like Alex Jones. They should not give a platform to inaccurate, amateur and hate-based trash.

Americans aren't forced to live in a cesspool infested by the likes of Jones and other people who don't have what it takes to produce accurate stories.

â€” Gary Frank

Wow, liberals coming out of the woodwork! It's funny how most liberals slander Jones when a great deal of what he does is backed by facts. I'm blown away by people who are so gullible.

â€” Daniel Mason

No regulated speech on phones, the internet or on the street between people ... yet. But that will be the next step. That is what desperate leftists do.

â€” Art DeMartini

To all you people crying, ""This is censorship,"" you need to look up the definition of the word. Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication or other information, on the basis that such material is considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive or inconvenient as determined by a ruling authority. Last time I checked, Apple, Facebook et al are no ""ruling authority.""

â€” Theodore Farkas

What others are saying

David French, The New York Times: ""The good news is that tech companies donâ€™t have to rely on vague, malleable and hotly contested definitions of hate speech to deal with conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones. The far better option would be to prohibit libel or slander on their platforms. To be sure, this would tie their hands more: Unlike 'hate speech,' libel and slander have legal meanings. There is a long history of using libel and slander laws to protect especially private figures from false claims. Itâ€™s properly more difficult to use those laws to punish allegations directed at public figures, but even then there are limits on intentionally false factual claims. Itâ€™s a high bar. But itâ€™s a bar that respects the marketplace of ideas, avoids the politically charged battle over ever shifting norms in language and culture, and provides protection for aggrieved parties.""

Timothy B. Lee, Ars Technica: ""Booting someone like Jones from Facebook or YouTube altogether could easily turn him into a martyr among his paranoid fans. And policing content for factual accuracy could suck platforms into endless controversies over hot-button political issues. So as unsatisfying as Facebook's approach is, it might be the best of some bad options.""

Ruth Ben-Ghiat, CNN.com: ""Twitter's silence so far on this matter is deafening, considering that the platform hosts one of the main sources of lies, threats and racist slurs against individuals and causes that don't support the right's alternate reality: Trump's personal Twitter account, with 53.5 million followers. ... Jones may be partly silenced, but only a concerted and bipartisan effort will stop a crusade against truth that's unparalleled in American history and of the utmost gravity, given the support it enjoys from the apex of power. Those companies who don't step up to the plate now should re-examine their priorities.""

3QTFNPMJC70HLSW4TE5SHDCFOTKNZF,University Coach Tells Player to Choose Between Posting Firearm Photos or Playing Lacrosse,"Floridaâ€™s Palm Beach Atlantic University lacrosse coach sent text messages to one of his players warning him that he had to choose between posting online photos of firearms or playing lacrosse.

The NRA-ILA reports that the playerâ€”on Instagram as @Duckmanschollâ€”had been posting photos of game he hunted and guns he liked to carry.

Here is an example of the playerâ€™s posts:

The lacrosse coach responded to the photos by texting, â€œYou want to play lacrosse for PBA [Palm Beach Atlantic University], you wonâ€™t post pics of your guns and stuff. Thatâ€™s simple. You want to continue to post thisâ€”you donâ€™t play.â€

The player made clear that forced to choose between exercising his Second Amendment rights and playing lacrosse, he would stick with his guns. He then filed a complaint with the university and the school said â€œthe studentâ€™s pictures did not violate school policy and that they had spoken to the coach about the issue.â€

On August 8, Breitbart News reported that a student wearing an NRA shirt was removed from a high school history class in Californiaâ€™s Lodi Unified School District. The history teacher who removed the student gave an anti-gun lecture to a second student, who was also wearing an NRA shirt.

The district says the shirts did not violate the school dress code and made clear they will be working with staff on â€œdress code policies.â€

Could you imagine DUMP saying this about an opponent?

I disagreed with John McCain on everything, but I recognized he was a veteran, a former POW and served our country. Unlike the occupant in the White House. Two things he did that I admired was him correcting the voter in the audience who said Obama was not an American while he was campaigning in 2008 and then his â€œthumbs downâ€ on ACA repeal to join the all the Democrats and 2 other GOPers. Although, that vote lost a bit of itâ€™s luster when he voted for the tax scam that ended individual mandates.

Next topic: What do we do about the un-indicted co-conspirator in the White House? We need to keep the pressure up on Congress until they have to relent. Unfortunately, I have a bad feeling they will be able to push Kavanaugh through to the SCOTUS. Well, weâ€™re just going to have to fight back by electing Democrats up and down the ballot from dog catcher all the way up to Governor in as many states as we can. We need to take the House and hopefully, in 2020 the Senate and presidency too. We will pass an iron clad Voting Rights Act, we will pass more fixes to the ACA to strengthen it, we will pummel them with progressive laws all over the country. Only so many cases can get to the SCOTUS. We ARE NOT GOING TO LET THE 20% EXTREME RELIGIOUS RIGHT RULE US.

VOTE, VOTE, VOTE! Drive someone to the polls after you have voted. Get people out to vote that donâ€™t normally vote. Lets turn this around. Itâ€™s time for the over 70% liberal to progressive population of this country to be heard.

3YLTXLH3DGOVXS8N37CDLVD5SRGPHH,Fury as feminist activist says she's 'confused' seeing black man with pro-NRA and Tea Party bumper stickers,"An activist author ignited a social media firestorm on Thursday after saying she was left â€œvery confusedâ€ seeing a black man with a pro-NRA and Tea Party bumper sticker on his car.

Kimberley Johnson, a feminist contributor to HuffPost and the spokeswoman for the national advocacy group We Are Woman, was slammed for questioning why a black person would not embrace progressive politics.

â€œOut on the road the other day I saw an affluent black man driving a BMW with two bumper-stickers. One was pro-NRA and the other one was a Tea Party sticker that read, â€˜Don't tread on me,â€™â€ she wrote in a now-deleted tweet. â€œThis left me very confused.â€

She was immediately condemned, with most social media users accusing her of racism. â€œIt's not confusing to people who don't judge others based on their skin tone. You should try it,â€ wrote user.

â€œOne of the most racist things ever are people who think black people MUST all think alike and vote for the same party,â€ tweeted journalist Jason Howerton.

Johnson attempted to defend her tweet, saying she was merely â€œconfusedâ€ and didnâ€™t mean to tell black Americans who they should support. â€œIt's not about skin tone. It's about people voting against their own interests. The same can be said for anyone who isn't rich and white,â€ she wrote in one tweet.

She also accused the Tea Party movement and the GOP of not representing everyone and helping only â€œwhite, rich men.â€

Amid the turmoil, the author erased the controversial tweet and explained the reason for the deletion. â€œI deleted a tweet that questioned why African Americans would support the Tea Party, and people saw that as racist. I do not see the GOP working in the best interests of people of color or women. I never said anyone should vote any particular way. I said it confused me,â€ Johnson tweeted.

â€œI deleted it because people were putting words in my mouth and changing my original intent. FOR THE RECORD: I do not believe everyone should vote the way I do. However, I am free to wonder what motivates people to vote,â€ she added.",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/07/06/fury-as-feminist-activist-says-shes-confused-seeing-black-man-with-pro-nra-and-tea-party-bumper-stickers.html,"['Neutral', 'Republican', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Neutral']","['1', '3', '1', '1', '2']"

The gun control survey includes the opinions of 772 teens who were asked their thoughts between July 2017 and January 2018 -- before the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Seventeen students and staff members were killed in that shooting on Feb. 14 and the March for Our Lives movement was born in its aftermath.

In the survey, 62% of US teens said gun control laws could be used to decrease mass shootings, while 33% said they thought there would be no impact if access to guns was more strictly controlled. Only 2% felt that gun control laws could increase mass shootings, while 3% were unsure, according to a report published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.

The survey was done with the National MyVoice Text Message Cohort, a survey system that polls teen using text messages. Rather than picking from a list of options, teens can send their raw opinion -- emojis and all -- to researchers, who then sort the responses into types to be analyzed.

""Yes!! They would make it harder to get guns right away, or at all if u have a record of crime or instability,"" said one teen who thought gun control would reduce mass shootings.

""Yes. Less guns, less deaths. Basic logic,"" said another.

3GKAWYFRAQBELC3LHBTNUAY70ZNPD8,"On the travel ban, the Supreme Court just made a historic mistake â€” again","Qasim Rashid is an attorney, author, and national spokesman for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community USA and a Truman National Security Fellow. Follow him on Twitter @MuslimIQ.

In a 5-to-4 decision on Tuesday, the Supreme Court exercised its power to uphold President Trumpâ€™s travel ban â€” now often referred to as a â€œMuslim ban.â€

And itâ€™s called that for good reason.

Then-candidate Trump issued a formal declaration in December 2015 calling for â€œa complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.â€ He followed up this news release with repeated statements calling for a ban on Muslims, that â€œIslam hates us,â€ and by fabricating stories of American generals mass executing Muslims.

The Trump campaign maintained that a Muslim ban is necessary to maintain national security. The fact is, this was never about national security. The travel ban was always about anti-Muslim religious animus â€” animus that has resulted in record highs in the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes.

As if it wasnâ€™t already obvious enough to anyone who has read the First Amendment, once it became clear that religious discrimination was not a viable reason to ban immigrants or refugees, the narrative shifted to banning people based on country of citizenship. But even this claim, on its face, fell flat. A Department of Homeland Security memo concluded that, â€œcitizenship is an unlikely indicator for terror threats within the [United States].â€

Additionally, the White House conducted a study to demonstrate that refugees have a negative economic impact on America. However, when the study backfired and concluded that refugees contribute $63 billion more to America than they receive, the White House buried the study and focused only on the costs associated with refugee resettlement.

The Trump administration is on pace to admit the fewest refugees since 1980 â€” only about 21,000, which is far below the cap of 110,000 established by the Obama administration. Historically, refugees have never posed a threat to national security in America. The conservative-leaning Cato Institute warned from the beginning, â€œa rational evaluation of national security threats is not the basis for Trumpâ€™s orders, as the risk is fairly small but the cost is great. The measures taken here will have virtually no effect on improving U.S. national security.â€ The instituteâ€™s analysis is based in fact â€” for instance, no refugee over the past 45 years has killed an American citizen. Not one. In another prominent analysis, Americans have only a 1-in-3.64 billion chance of being killed by a refugee. Thatâ€™s 5,200 times more unlikely than the chance of being struck by lightning.

Indeed, if national security were Trumpâ€™s priority, where is the attention to Americaâ€™s gun-violence epidemic? While refugees have never killed an American in fatal terror attack in the last 45 years, let alone during the 523 days since Trump took office, gun violence tells a different tale. According to GunViolenceArchive.org, since the beginning of 2017, there have been at least 89,782 shootings and 497 mass shootings. These shootings have resulted in the deaths of 22,591 Americans. In response, the president has enacted exactly zero bills to improve legislation to protect Americans from gun violence.

Just weeks ago, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in MasÂ­terpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which applied the bedÂ­rock principles of religious neutrality and tolerance in considering a First Amendment challenge to government action, and that â€œstate actors cannot show hostility to religious views; rather, they must give those views â€˜neutral and respectful consideration.â€™ â€ Those principles should apply equally here.

Unfortunately, the majority appears to have forgotten its own decision in the Masterpiece Cakeshop piece. Instead, this ruling echoes historical Supreme Court failures such as Dred Scott vs. Sandford decision which ruled that black people are aliens with no entitlement to citizenship; or Plessy v. Ferguson, which ruled that black people are alien and, therefore, racial segregation is constitutional; or Cherokee Nation v. Georgia which ruled that Native Americans are alien to America and therefore cannot bring suit for their grievances; or Korematsu v. United States, which ruled that U.S. citizens of Japanese descent were alien and, because of national security, could be thrown into internment camps.

Just as the majority of Americans and the president turned away the SS St. Louis, a german ocean liner carrying Jewish refugees escaping Nazi Germany, today the majority of the Court and the president turn away refugees escaping war and famine.

Ultimately the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision to uphold the Trump travel ban is a reminder that legality is indeed a function of power â€” it is not a function of morality. Though initially hailed as legal and backed by power, Dred Scott, Plessy, Cherokee Nation and Korematsu have all been overturned.

It may take years or even decades, but when the day comes that morality does overcome power, Hawaii v. Trump will join that list.

CEO Edward W. Stack of DICK'S Sporting Goods decided to end the sale of assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines at stores. (Photo by Scott Dalton/Invision for DICK'S Sporting Goods/AP Images)

The #BoycottNRA social media movement has prompted a fast-growing list of companies -- from the First National Bank of Omaha to Enterprise rental cars -- to end partnerships with the gun lobby group. But amid all the talk of avoiding purchases from companies affiliated with the National Rifle Association in the aftermath of the massacre in Parkland, Fla., plenty of consumers are also planning to do a lot of buying.

For instance, conservative commentator Michelle Malkin tweeted â€œGun-owners &amp; #2A activists: Time to BUYcott,"" while gun control advocates cheered Dick's Sporting Goods' decision to stop selling assault-style firearms and ban high-capacity magazines from its stores, saying they planned to shop more there as a result.

The term â€œbuycottâ€ is hardly new â€” itâ€™s been used over the years to explain efforts by conservative and liberal consumers to spend money in support of companies with which they agree, especially as a counter-protest to those boycotting the same brands. But new research from the global public relations firm Weber Shandwick suggests the tactic of ""buycotting"" iss gaining steam â€” and may overtake boycotts as the most prevalent way consumers vote with their dollars.

""I feel strongly that weâ€™re seeing the infancy of this whole 'buycotting' movement,"" said Leslie Gaines-Ross, chief reputation strategist at Weber Shandwick. ""Boycotts are not going away, but people are really making choices about the brands and the companies they want to support and a lot of it has to do with politics or social issues.""

In a report released Jan. 30, the firm surveyed 2,000 U.S. and British consumers who had taken at least one of nine actions in response to something that a company or brand did. Fifty-nine percent of these more activist-minded consumers said it was more important than ever to participate in consumer boycotts, while far more â€” 83 percent â€” said it was more important now to support companies they believe â€œdo the right thingâ€ and buy from them.

Even among those who had taken part in some kind of boycotting, a greater share said supporting companies with purchases (or â€œbuycotting,â€ at 79 percent) was what mattered most rather than boycotting (62 percent).

The shooting took place in front of congregants during a service at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints meetinghouse, Kaitlin Ritchie, a spokeswoman for the City of Fallon, told Fox 13.

Fallon Police Chief Kevin Gehman identified the suspect as 48-year-old John Kelley Oâ€™Connor. Gehman said Oâ€™Connor fired multiple shots, then left the church and walked to his home, which is right across the street, according to The Nevada Appeal.

Gehman said Oâ€™Connor surrendered to police officers and sheriffâ€™s deputies after authorities called the home and asked him to do so, KOLO-TV reported.

Investigators said it was too early to understand the motive, but added the attack appeared to be directed at an individual rather than the church.

Police said Oâ€™Connor was a member of the church and had been attending services prior to the shooting.

The second victim has a non-life-threatening leg injury and has been hospitalized. The victimsâ€™ identities were not immediately revealed because of pending next-of-kin identification.

Sunday afternoon, Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., sent a tweet of condolence, acknowledging heâ€™s in contact with officials investigating the shooting: â€œDeeply saddened by the act of senseless violence in Fallon today at the LDS church.â€

He added, â€œMy family and I are praying for all loved ones, churchgoers, and community members impacted by this tragedy.â€

WASHINGTON â€“ Federal authorities unsealed charges Monday against a 29-year-old Russian national who is accused of seeking to infiltrate American political organizations, including the National Rifle Association, on behalf of the Kremlin.

Mariia Butina appeared in federal court late Monday following her weekend arrest in Washington. She is being held in custody pending a detention hearing.

The charges are not related to Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. Rather, the case was announced by the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, where federal investigators asserted Butina has been operating as a covert Russian agent since her arrival in August 2016.

The timing of the charging announcement, however, comes on the same day that a summit in Helsinki between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin put a spotlight on accusations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. After meeting with Putin, Trump accepted Putin's denials that Russia had interfered in the U.S. election. The president's comments prompted lawmaker outrage and the release of a rare statement from Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats underscoring Russia's role.

""The FBI's investigation has revealed that Butina was working in the United States at the direction (of a Russian government official),"" the court documents state, adding that both operatives sought to establish ""back channel lines of communications.""

""These lines could be used by the Russian Federation to penetrate the U.S. national decision making apparatus to advance the agenda of the Russian Federation.""

Before Monday's action by federal authorities, Butina's activities in the U.S. â€“ along with those of Alexander Torshin, a Russian politician and a top official of Russia's central bank â€“ have been the subject of several media reports about their attempts to cultivate political influence in the U.S.

Torshin is not named in the court documents made public Monday, but the ""Russian official"" described as Butina's co-conspirator matches Torshin's public profile as a former member of the Russian legislature who later became a top official at the Russian bank.

A March report issued by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee referred to the public reporting about the Butina and Torshin, claiming that Butina ""sought to facilitate meetings with Trump campaign officials and between President Putin and candidate Trump during the election.""

""Ms. Butina, who appears to have been active with the NRA in recent years within the U.S., reportedly has founded a Russian counterpart gun advocacy organization,"" the congressional report stated. ""She may be able to clarify for the committee the origin and purpose of alleged Russian-directed efforts to approach U.S. organizations and persons connected to the Trump campaign throughout and prior to 2016. (The Democrat) minority believes that it is important to request as a matter of record Ms. Butinaâ€™s cooperation even if she is not a U.S. citizen ...""

Butina's attorney, Robert Driscoll, denied the government's claim of her work as an agent of the Russian government. Since her home was searched by the FBI in April, Driscoll said Butina has ""repeatedly"" offered to cooperate with federal investigators.

Separately, Driscoll said Butina has testified privately before the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.

""The substance of the charge...is overblown,"" Driscoll said. ""While styled as some sort of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agent Registration Act, in actuality it describes a conspiracy to have a 'friendship dinner' at (restaurant) Bistro Bis with a group of Americans and Russians to discuss foreign relations between the two countries â€“ hardly a shocking development for (a) Russian international relations student living in Washington.""

The NRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

In court documents released Monday, prosecutors alleged that the two Russians ""planned to advance Moscow's long-term strategic objectives in the United States, in part, by establishing relationships with American political organizations, including the gun rights organization.""

As part of the alleged ""influence operations,"" Butina was directed by the Russian official to meet with U.S. politicians and candidates, attend meetings by special interest groups, and report back to Moscow.

In a March 24, 2015, email obtained by investigators Butina referred to the gun rights group as ""central"" to conservative politics, noting that the group has been a sponsor of the Conservative Political Action Conference or CPAC.

Trump was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the NRAâ€™s spending in the 2016 election. The group spent more than $30 million to boost his candidacy and attack his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. The spending was remarkable at the time because few established conservative groups supported Trumpâ€™s unorthodox candidacy for the White House.

3ZZAYRN1I793H1NHO1GNAEB3T2FOTH,The Maria Butina Case Was Never About The Sex Life Of A Russian Spy,"That year, the two broke their four-year streak of attending the annual NRA convention.

The FBI has reportedly been investigating whether Torshin illegally funneled money to the NRA to help Donald Trump win the election.

US District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington on Monday rejected Butina's request that she be released on bond ahead of her trial, agreeing with a previous decision that the alleged Russian agent posed a flight risk. But Chutkan also slammed US prosecutors for their ""rather salacious"" claim earlier this summer that Butina had offered sex for a job, only to walk it back when her lawyers accused them of misinterpreting an innocent joke between friends.

The insistence of news organizations -- and to some extent, federal prosecutors -- to cast Butina as some sort of ""Red Sparrow"" seductress misses the larger story unfolding in court documents, of an influence campaign that set its sights on influencing Republican politicians' attitudes toward Russia through the National Rifle Association, the National Prayer Breakfast, and other conservative political events and organizations long before the 2016 election.

Former counterintelligence officials have pointed out that the case is larger than Butina or the Trump campaign. It shows that even before Trump was a candidate, Russia had identified gun rights and religion as two easy access points to connect with powerful US groups and politicians.

The court filings indicate that it was often Erickson, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, who adopted the more incriminating language.

In asking an acquaintance for tickets to the National Prayer Breakfast for a delegation of Russians in 2017, he wrote, ""if we can accommodate them, we can empower rational insiders that have been cultivated for three years.""

He referred to Torshin as ""Putin's emissary,"" and told a contact to pitch the Kremlin's involvement when asking members of Congress and other influential Americans to meet with them -- ""reaction to the delegation's presence in America will be relayed DIRECTLY to President Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.""

The message went on to note parenthetically that both Putin and Lavrov had had to ""personally approve the delegation's travel to this event.""

In a previous message to Erickson, Butina wrote that the purpose of the Russians attending the event was to ""establish a back channel of communication.""

Butina's lawyer argued that she just ""believes and desires peace and better US-Russia relations,"" and that what prosecutors describe as her ""reports"" to Torshin were just due to her being ""energized by the excitement of witnessing history and charmed by American culture and politics,"" which she wanted to tell people back home about.

""For all of the government insinuation and media coverage of Hollywood style, spy-novel allegations, in reality this case is bereft of any tradecraft or covert activity whatsoever,"" he said last week. ""There are no dead drops, no brush passes, no secret communication devices, no bags of cash or payoffs, no bribes, no confidential secret information gathering, no espionage type activity, and no agency or agreement to commit crime.""

US prosecutors countered that no one is accusing her of Cold War-era spycraft.

""Stealing 'national secrets' is not an element of any of the offenses with which the defendant is charged,"" they wrote.

But they also made clear that they believe the Russian government's actions show that Butina was no average Russian caught up in an American court case. Since her arrest, the prosecutors said, Butina has been visited in jail six times by Russian officials, her detention has been the subject of four notes from the Russian government to the State Department and two conversations between Foreign Minister Lavrov and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and the Russian Foreign Ministry has changed the avatar on its Twitter account to an image of Butina.

Police Chief Kevin Gehman of Fallon, Nevada, identified the suspected shooter as 48-year-old John Kelley O'Connor and said the man surrendered to authorities at his home.

""City of Fallon Police Officers and Churchill County Sheriff's Deputies surrounded the home while a hostage negotiator was called to the scene. After placing phone calls to the home, O'Connor agreed to exit the property and surrender to officers,"" a statement from police read.

Mr O'Connor is being held, but has not been formally charged as yet for the death of Charles E ""Burt"" Miller, a fellow member of the Church of Latter Day Saints in the small city, 60 miles southeast of Reno. The second victim was treated and released from hospital. Mr O'Connor has not yet commented.

Approximately 50 churchgoers witnessed the shooting, which took place just as the Sunday morning service was ending. Fallon city spokesperson Kaitlin Ritchie confirmed Mr O'Connor had been in attendance at the service before the 1pm shooting occurred.

Mr Gehman pointed out it was ""too early"" to determine the motive of the shooter but he said ""it does not appear to have been directed at the church, but an individual victim"".

He also noted the shooter used a medium-size calibre handgun.

It is unclear at this time what, if any, Mr O'Connor and Mr Miller may have had and if Mr O'Connor had a permit to carry the type of firearm used in the crime.

Fallon police have not immediately responded to a request for comment.

Mr Gehman also said local police had ""contacts"" with Mr O'Connor in the past, but did not elaborate on the nature of those incidents, only saying they were ""nothing that would rise to this level"".

Latter-Day Saints Church spokesperson Eric Hawkins said in a statement: ""We express our love to those in this congregation and our prayers for the victims and their families. Local leaders are ministering to them at this time"".

US Senator Catherine Cortez Masto from Nevada tweeted: ""My heart goes out to all of those impacted. Places of worship should be a safe haven. The gun violence across this country must end.""

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) ORG XMIT: NJCK112 (Photo: AP)

WASHINGTON â€“ President Donald Trump slammed political leaders in Chicago on Thursday, blaming city officials for the weekend violence that left 12 people dead.

â€œI guess you have to take it from the leadership,â€ Trump said in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he was holding a meeting on prison reform. â€œIt's called bad leadership.â€

Trump has frequently criticized city leaders in Chicago over violence there. A month after taking office, Trump said crime in the city was â€œtotally out of control."" He threatened to ""send in the feds,"" which some interpreted as a reference to the National Guard.

Trump instead deployed agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

In his remarks Thursday, the president did not name Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who served as President Barack Obamaâ€™s first chief of staff. Trump instead spoke broadly about the ""bad stuff"" happening in the city, and blamed its leaders.

At least 72 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend, including 12 fatally.

â€œThereâ€™s no reason in a million years something like that should be happening,â€ Trump said.

The Emanuel administration, which has been repeatedly attacked by Trump during his nearly 20 months in the White House, chaffed at the barb from Trump.

â€œBob Mueller's investigation and Paul Manafort's criminal trial must be getting to the president,â€ said Adam Collins, a spokesman for Emanuel. â€œWe're too busy working to continue reducing crime with police, community leaders, ministers and federal prosecutors to pay attention to his musings.â€

The mayor said this week that ""we as a city, in every corner, have an accountability and responsibility.""

""If you know who did this, be a neighbor,"" Emmanuel said. ""Speak up.""

Trump, who frequently discussed reducing crime in U.S. cities during his 2016 campaign, was speaking from his New Jersey golf resort, where he is on a working vacation. In a meeting with governors and members of his cabinet, the president said his administration wants to ensure former inmates can find employment.

He said the low unemployment rate is helping all Americans find work and also noted that he met with Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, to discuss legislation to help former inmates reenter the workforce.

â€œWe want to treat Americans fairly,â€ Trump said.

Former Chicago Police Garry McCarthy, who is running against Emanuel, said in an interview that the department lost â€œan incredible amount of talentâ€ because of Emanuelâ€™s decision to fire or push into retirement police department leaders during the fallout of the controversial Laquan McDonald shooting in 2014.

The city was forced by a 2015 court order to publicly release video of the officer-involved shooting of the black teen who was shot 16 times by a white police officer.

McCarthy was fired by Emmanuel days after the release of the video. The former Chicago top cop pointed to the ouster of two chiefs of the departments detectiveâ€™s division in the fallout of the controversy as having a negative impact on the police department.

Chicago has tallied more than 1,400 murders and 6,200 shootings in 2016 and 2017, and more than 325 shootings thus far in 2018.

â€œHereâ€™s a fact that people donâ€™t recognize,â€ McCarthy said. â€œIf you compare the murder rates in Chicago to 2013, 2014, and 2015 â€“ my last three years as superintendent â€“ to 2016, 2017, and 2018, there are almost 400 murders in the city of Chicago.

""That is mass murder, and itâ€™s been facilitated by the political environment thatâ€™s been created and the anti-police environment,"" McCarthy said.

Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, in a phone call Saturday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said U.S. charges against a Russian woman as a Moscow government agent were ""fabricated"" and demanded her immediate release.

Maria Butina, a 29-year-old Russian citizen, was arrested last weekend and charged with infiltrating American political organizations, including the National Rifle Association.

Lavrov discussed the issue by phone with Pompeo in a follow-up conversation to the summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a statement by the Russian foreign ministry on its Facebook page.

In the phone call, Lavrov stressed ""the unacceptability of the actions of the U.S. authorities, who have arrested Russian citizen Maria Butina in the United States on the basis of fabricated charges, and the need for her early release,"" according to Interfax.

Prosecutors say Butina engaged in a years-long campaign as a covert agent for the Kremlin in an attempt to ""advance the interests of her home country.""

""The defendant's covert influence campaign involved substantial planning, international coordination and preparation,"" prosecutors wrote in a court filing. ""The plan for Butina also required, and she demonstrated, a willingness to use deceit in a visa application to move to the United States and bring the plan to fruition.""

Butina pleaded not guilty.

The two men also discussed Syria as well as efforts to promote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

Russia has been steadily beating the drum on Butina's behalf. On Thursday, the Russian foreign ministry announced a #FreeMariaButina campaign. A tweet by the foreign ministry called on supporters to add a photo of Butina to their Twitter avatars.

Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to the U.S., told a conference in Moscow on Friday that the allegations are groundless and that American authorities tried to â€œbreak herâ€ and refused her consular visits for the first few days after her arrest, The Associated Press reported.

In jailing Butina pending her trial, Magistrate Deborah Robinson sided with federal prosecutors who argued that the Russian represented an â€œextremeâ€ flight risk. Federal agents said that at the time of Butina's arrest, her apartment was packed with boxes ""consistent with a move."" Butina's attorney, Robert Driscoll, said the packing boxes were in preparation for a move to South Dakota â€“ not back to Russia â€“ where Driscoll said she intended to live with her boyfriend.

The charges are not related to Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. Rather, the case was announced by the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, where federal investigators asserted Butina has been operating as a covert Russian agent since her arrival in August 2016.

The timing of the charging announcement, however, came on the same day that a summit in Helsinki between Trump and Putin put a spotlight on accusations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

3MIVREZQVIG7ZUAA95UZYSJ7PHYKQP,"Russian woman linked to gun-rights groups is indicted, charged with acting as foreign agent","A Russian woman accused of conspiring to infiltrate U.S. political organizations â€” possibly including the National Rifle Association â€” at the direction of an unnamed senior Kremlin official was indicted by a federal grand jury and charged additionally Tuesday.

Maria Butina, 29, who accompanied Republican activist Paul Erickson to President Trumpâ€™s inauguration, was charged with a second offense of acting as a foreign agent, which has its own 10-year-maximum prison sentence, as Politico reported; she had been arrested Sunday on a charge of conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of the Russian government.

Butina, a Russian national who has been living in the U.S., will be jailed until a hearing set for Wednesday, officials said.

Butina, a former Siberian furniture owner, is also a board member and founder of the Russian gun-rights group, â€œThe Right to Bear Arms,â€ The Washington Post reported. Her earlier work reportedly included assisting Russian central banker and politician Alexander Torshin, who is a lifetime member of the NRA.

According to court papers, Butina met with U.S. politicians and candidates, attended events sponsored by special interest groups â€” including two National Prayer Breakfast events â€” and organized Russian-American â€œfriendship and dialogueâ€ dinners in Washington with the goal of â€œreporting back to Moscowâ€ what she had learned.

The affidavit also stated she started reaching out to NRA members and other American gun enthusiasts in 2013, on several occasions hosting NRA executives and gun activists in Moscow, including one delegation that included former Sheriff David Clarke of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin.

She and Torshin also attended a series of NRA events in the United States starting in 2014.

In a statement, Butina's attorney, Robert Driscoll, called the allegations ""overblown"" and said prosecutors had criminalized mundane networking opportunities. Driscoll said Butina was not an agent of the Russian Federation but was instead in the U.S. on a student visa, graduating from American University with a master's degree in international relations.

""There is simply no indication of Ms. Butina seeking to influence or undermine any specific policy or law or the United States â€” only at most to promote a better relationship between the two nations,"" Driscoll said in a statement. ""The complaint is simply a misuse of the Foreign Agent statute, which is designed to punish covert propaganda, not open and public networking by foreign students.""

CHEERS to razzmatazz in the land of OKFLAZ. All eyeballs not riveted to porn tonight will be glued south of the mason-Dixon Line as primary results roll in from Oklahoma, Florida and Arizona. Here are some of the big races being decided ahead of the midterms, which are a mere 69 days away:

Florida: Rick Scott's reign of error is blissfully coming to an end, so tonight's action will decide the November contenders, one of whom will have the task of fumigating his office in January. For Democrats: Gwen Graham and Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum. For Republicans: Rep.Ron DeSantis and state agriculture commissioner Adam Putnam. Remember: if you take more than one â€œI Votedâ€ sticker, itâ€™s eighteen years in jail and a $200,000 fine, bub. Arizona: Governor's primaries will pit incumbent Republican Doug Ducey against Secretary of State Ken Bennett, and Democrats David Garcia and Kelly Fryer are duking it out for the chance to boot the winner. Also: Jeff Flake's senate seat is open, so there's action on both sides: Rep. Martha McSally vs. Trumpbot conspiracy wackos Dr. Kelli Ward and the freshly-pardoned crook Joe Arpaio on the Republican side, and Rep. Kyrsten Sinema vs. Deedra Abboud for Team D. It'll be fun watching Sheriff Joe get kicked to the curb one more time. Oklahoma: Just a Republican runoff for governor. The winner faces former Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson on November 6th.

There are also several House races in Florida and Arizona, and you can read the tea leaf readers' tea leaf readings via Daily Kos Elections here and Vox here. The DK Elections Team---""The Best in the Business!""---will be on duty tonight to liveblog all the action, and Steve Kornacki will be unleashed for another frenetic act of his one-man performance of The Ballot Ballet. Words of wisdom to his on-set tech crew: give him a wide berth when you see him in front of his interactive map screen or he'll swipe you into the next county.

JEERS to Captain Smallthinker. Neil Simon, eat yer Heaven-bound heart out. Yesterday the Trump Comedy Hour performed a guaranteed-to-become-a-classic sketch from the Oval Office, where a futzy speakerphone, a hapless assistant, and the ramblings of Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto and his translator provided enough hilarity for straight man Donald Trump to fume over that he's virtually assured the Emmy nomination that he's coveted so bigly for decades. The skit revolved around the Preliminary And Tentative Hypothetical Exploratory Trade Interrelation Concurrence (PATHETIC). David Frum gives the performance two thumbs up:

x Congratulations to the Trump administration on reaching a preliminary agreement in principle to begin negotiations with half of America's NAFTA counterparties with a view to revising one section of the trade agreement! David Frum (@davidfrum) August 27, 2018

He only makes the best deals. Unfortunately, these days it takes a magnifying glass to see them.

CHEERS to happy coincidences. Fifty-five years ago today, on August 28, 1963, an intimate gathering of 200,000 people watched as Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech (watch it here) from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. And ten years ago tonight Barack Obama echoed the words of King (among them: ""The fierce urgency of now"") when he spoke to a packed stadium in Denver as the first African-American presidential nominee in the history of the universe. This for me is still King's money quote:

""I have a dream my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but the content of their character.""

Or as modern day Republicans call it: a nightmare.

Emmett with his mom.

JEERS to the good dying much too young. Speaking of civil rights, today is the 63rd anniversary of the abduction and murder of 14 year-old Emmett Till---a shocking and disgraceful act that helped spark the civil rights movement in 1955. Till's original glass-topped casket (his remains were exhumed and re-buried in 2005) was restored and went on display at the Smithsonian's Museum of African American History and Culture. We hope his killers---who confessed after they were acquitted and never showed remorse before they died in 1980 and 1994---are currently in the process of feeling a certain burning sensation for eternity.

JEERS to America: land of the guns, home of the gun nuts. Speaking of senseless murders: what happens in the wake of the massacre in Newtown Aurora Binghamton Tucson Santa Barbara Charleston Lafayette Roseburg Kalamazoo Orlando Alexandria Las Vegas Benton Parkland etcetera etcetera etcetera Jacksonville, Florida during what was supposed to be a happy day of videogaming (3 dead, 11 wounded by an angry white guy, which is why Trump hasn't said a word about it) is depressingly predictable:

The community will grieve as the victims are buried. Gun control advocates, led by the Stoneman Douglas activists, will wisely suggest that this might be a good time to review our federal and state firearms policies so that our nation's shameful record of gun violence might be improved upon. The president and his minions will blame Democrats for the carnage and urge every living soul and their pets to arm themselves to the teeth, but not before insincerely offering their â€œthoughts and prayers.â€ And, this being Florida, aka Gun Carnage central, Marco Rubio will tweet out worthless Bible passages and Governor Rick Scott will again vow to â€œdo everything in my power to prevent this from happening againâ€ and then do nothing because snakes canâ€™t do much but eat and sun themselves on a rock. And the NRA will continue scaring Republican politicians into looking the other way by informing them that, ""We'll be scoring you on your response."" And it will all happen again sooner rather than later. Like I said, predictable. Depressingly.

CHEERS to history not repeating itself. On August 28, 1968, police and anti-war demonstrators made a giant clusterfuck of things in the streets of Chicago as the Democratic National Convention nominated Hubert Humphrey. In the wake of the fracas all the parties came together and instituted a new rule that has served conventions well ever since: Decaf, Decaf, Decaf.

On the other other hand, looking at it makes me realize how small and insignificant I am---a pimple on a gnat's ass's pimple on a gnat's ass after being zapped by a sub-atomic miniaturization ray gun. So, yeah, like I said: bow ties---not a fan.

Have a tolerable Tuesday. Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering about today?

3D1TUISJWJI8LSR3QBTSVD1J0CBIU5,Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sees both sides on hot issues,"CLOSE Heâ€™s up for a seat on our highest court. Here's what you need to know about Brett Kavanaugh. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON â€“ Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sought to strike down the District of Columbia's gun registration requirement and ban on semi-automatic rifles in 2011. But he said, ""I greatly respect the motivation"" behind the laws.

The following year, he opposed a ruling that allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases, though he acknowledged that ""EPA issued these regulations to help address global warming, a policy issue of major long-term significance to the United States.""

Later that year, Kavanaugh upheld South Carolina's photo identification law because it allowed for exceptions. ""In some states ... minorities disproportionately lack photo IDs,"" he wrote for a three-judge panel. ""That racial gap has exacerbated concerns about voter ID laws.""

And in 2015, he sided in part with a religious nonprofit seeking to avoid a federal mandate that it provide insurance coverage for birth control. At the same time, he said, ""the government has a compelling interest in facilitating access to contraception.""

""It is commonly accepted that reducing the number of unintended pregnancies would further women's health, advance women's personal and professional opportunities, reduce the number of abortions, and help break a cycle of poverty,"" Kavanaugh wrote.

From gun control to birth control, environmental protection to voting rights, President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court has been a reliable conservative vote on its steppingstone, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

At the same time, Kavanaugh has displayed a degree of understanding that often borders on empathy for the policy goals of those he rules against.

""As one who was born here, grew up in this community in the late 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and has lived and worked in this area almost all of his life, I am acutely aware of the gun, drug, and gang violence that has plagued all of us,"" he wrote in the Washington, D.C., gun control case. ""My view on how to analyze the constitutional question here under the relevant Supreme Court precedents is not to say that I think certain gun registration laws or laws regulating semi-automatic guns are necessarily a bad idea as a matter of policy.""

That ability to see issues from other points of view has given some liberals hope that if he wins confirmation, Kavanaugh could be an honest broker on the court and not a knee-jerk addition to the conservative majority.

Akhil Reed Amar, a liberal constitutional scholar who taught Kavanaugh at Yale Law School, says the 53-year-old judge's â€œcombination of smarts, constitutional knowledge and openness make him clearly superior.â€

""He goes out of his way to make sure heâ€™s hearing both sides,â€ Amar says.

Abortion and health care

To be sure, most of Kavanaugh's roughly 300 opinions, concurrences and dissents came out as conservatives hoped. That's why he was nominated to succeed retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose own brand of conservatism veered left on key social issues such as abortion and gay rights.

But unlike the late Justice Antonin Scalia, he often seeks to appease rather than aggravate the other side.

Kavanaugh's dissent last year in a case involving an undocumented teenager in federal custody who wanted an abortion is a case in point. He could have joined Judge Karen Henderson, who argued that the 17-year-old lacked any right to an abortion because of the ""fundamental difference between citizenship and illegal presence in our country.""

Instead, he merely argued that more time should have been allowed for a sponsor to come forward, so that the girl could get an abortion without government involvement.

""If transfer does not work, given existing Supreme Court precedent and the position the government has so far advanced in this litigation, it could turn out that the government will be required by existing Supreme Court precedent to allow the abortion,"" he said.

Neal Devins, a professor at William &amp; Mary Law School and author of a book on the abortion debate, says Kavanaugh's reasoning shows he does not want to ""rock the boat.""

""He doesnâ€™t want to be seen as someone who is an advocate for the cause,"" Devins says. ""Heâ€™s not going to push the court further than necessary, particularly on socially divisive issues.""

Similarly, Kavanaugh dissented in 2011 from an appeals court ruling upholding the Affordable Care Act, but only on procedural grounds. He said the law's mandate that individuals purchase health insurance or pay a tax penalty to the Internal Revenue Service could not be challenged before payment was made.

""History and precedent counsel caution before reaching out to decide difficult constitutional questions too quickly, especially when the underlying issues are of lasting significance,"" he wrote. ""After all, what appears to be obviously correct now can look quite different just a few years down the road.""

Timothy Jost, a health care expert and professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law, wrote that Kavanaugh saw ""both sides of the argument"" and ""concluded that the court should avoid a constitutional ruling until the case was properly before it.""

'The earth is warming'

On the controversial issue of voting rights, which comes before the Supreme Court almost every year in one or more cases, Kavanaugh weighed his words carefully in the South Carolina case.

""Many states have enacted voter ID laws for the stated purposes of deterring voter fraud and enhancing citizensâ€™ confidence in elections,"" he wrote. But he expressed concerns ""about the burden of obtaining a photo ID and, correspondingly, about denying voters without photo IDs the ability to vote.""

And while he has ruled consistently against what he sees as federal regulatory agencies run amok, Kavanaugh does so based on his reading of the separation of powers rather than for policy reasons.

During oral argument in 2016 on President Barack Obama's clean power plan, which was intended to slash carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants, he accused the EPA of ""setting unachievable limits."" But he called the policy ""laudable,"" adding, ""The earth is warming, and humans are contributing.""

Richard Lazarus, who teaches environmental and natural resources law at Harvard Law School, says Kavanaugh's rhetorical style is more muted than Scalia's, who often railed against environmental activism in the courts.

""Thatâ€™s not Brett Kavanaugh,"" Lazarus says. ""You donâ€™t see it in his opinions. You donâ€™t see it in his attitude. He doesnâ€™t come to the cases with that type of antipathy.""

3FK4G712NYIH0T2V6IS6KEPIODSSSR,3-D printed guns: Judge blocks publication of Cody Wilson's blueprints,"A federal judge on Monday blocked the release of blueprints for 3-D printed firearms online, ruling in favor of more than a dozen attorneys general who argued their publication increases the threat of gun violence across the country.

The Seattle court order effectively criminalized publication of the gun design files, banning Texas-based company Defense Distributed from posting them on the Internet.

The decision presents a new hurdle in the companyâ€™s fight to make weapon-design files publicly available, a case that has sparked a national conversation about the implications of untraceable plastic weapons and constitutional rights.

Judge Robert S. Lasnik of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington cited risks to public safety in granting the injunction.

He wrote that the attorneys general for 19 states and the District of Columbia who filed the lawsuit have â€œa legitimate fear that adding undetectable and untraceable guns to the arsenal of weaponry already available will likely increase the threat of gun violence they and their people experience.â€ The proliferation of digital weapon files, Lasnik said, â€œwill hamper law enforcement efforts to prevent and/or investigate crime.â€

The decision stems from a suit filed July 30 against the State Department, which had agreed to allow Defense Distributed to publish an arsenal of firearms blueprints online in a planned settlement. The states argued that the release of 3-D printable designs threatened national security and abridged their ability to pass and police gun laws.

Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson called the courtâ€™s decision â€œfarcical.â€

â€œIâ€™m happy to publicly suffer these clownish indignities to demonstrate how unprincipled the judiciary and different state attorneys general are capable of being when forced to confront an outcome they donâ€™t approve of,â€ Wilson, who is still involved in four pending lawsuits, told The Post on Monday.

Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, one of the chief law enforcement officers involved in the suit, lauded the courtâ€™s decision: â€œIâ€™m glad we put a stop to this dangerous policy.â€

The contentious fight over weapon-design files dates back to 2013, when Wilson manufactured the first printed handgun. Soon after, he sued the State Department over its demands that he remove blueprints from the Internet. In June, the federal government reversed course and entered into an agreement permitting Wilson to publish his firearm blueprints online. He intended to do so Aug. 1, but hours before publication, Lasnik stopped him.

Wilsonâ€™s critics have said his plan could put unregulated and difficult-to-detect weapons in the wrong hands.

Gun-control supporters, such as the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, also argued that 3-D printed weapons â€” that avoid layers of federal and state gun-control policies, such as permits and background checks â€” are not â€œtypically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes,â€ and, therefore, are not protected under the Second Amendment.

Mondayâ€™s order ignored the Justice Departmentâ€™s argument accusing the states of exceeding their constitutional powers to restrict a person from sharing information with other Americans.

Other legal experts have focused on the wide-reaching First Amendment implications of barring Wilson from releasing the files. They suggested that prohibiting publication of computer code â€” which has been available for download since at least 2013, according to State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert â€” amounts to a violation of free-speech rights.

There were protests and clashes between Democratic and Republican senators, but it was an odd snub made by Kavanaugh that's getting the most attention.

As Kavanaugh left his table upon the beginning of a lunch break, a man can be seen approaching Kavanaugh and extending his hand for a handshake. After a brief look, Kavanaugh turned and walked away, never shaking the man's hand.

That man was Fred Guttenberg, the outspoken father of Parkland shooting victim Jamie Guttenberg, who was on hand as part of his ongoing protest about gun control legislation. Kavanaugh notably wrote a dissent against upholding Washington, D.C.'s semi-automatic rifle ban in 2011.

Guttenberg himself tweeted about the incident.

The Fairmont Heights High School graduate was set to attend college on a track scholarship. (DeMarcus McMillan)

With candles at their feet and the evening summer sun above, Amer Millerâ€™s friends and family gathered at the community center near his home and linked hands.

â€œI want to read something that Amer wrote in my class that I think everybody needs to hear,â€ Millerâ€™s senior English teacher, DeMarcus McMillan, told the crowd encircling him.

â€œ â€˜How do we end gun violence?â€™ â€ McMillan said, reciting from one of Millerâ€™s essays. â€œ â€˜We should do it shoulder by shoulder, arm in arm, marching forward. We should do it without violence but do it with peace to show our community and our nation that we are not going to take it anymore.â€™ â€

As they listened to some of the last words Miller wrote, the dozens that stretched around the basketball court at Wednesdayâ€™s vigil stood silent, still shocked that a teen passionate about ending gun violence and so driven to succeed in life could be fatally shot weeks after his high school graduation and days before his 18th birthday.

Miller was killed July 14 after a gunman robbed him of his iPhone X and fled, according to Prince Georgeâ€™s County police. Miller happened to encounter the gunman shortly after the robbery and asked for his phone back, police said. Instead, police said, the gunman fired.

Within hours of the shooting, police arrested 26-year-old Davion Ballinger of the District and charged him with first-degree murder in Millerâ€™s slaying. Online court records did not list an attorney for Ballinger, but police charging documents said he denied that he was involved in the shooting.

[Teen killed for his watch and Gucci belt, police said]

Miller graduated from Fairmont Heights High School in May and had planned to attend Mount St. Maryâ€™s University in Maryland on a track scholarship, his family said. He wanted to study law and run in the Olympics. His funeral is scheduled for Monday, a day after what would have been his 18th birthday.

April and Kareem Miller said their son played football, ran track, was in the theater and was â€œfull of life and full of joy.â€

â€œEveryone he reached out to, he inspired and encouraged them to go for their dreams, because that is what we encouraged him to do,â€ April Miller said. â€œItâ€™s sad that we couldnâ€™t see the second part of his life.â€

She proudly remembers her son at a signing ceremony Fairmont Heights held for graduating seniors to announce where they were going to college. Miller stood onstage with a special message for the underclassmen: â€œNever let anyone take your dreams, because if God says itâ€™s for you, then itâ€™s for you.â€

Clarke Perry, the senior class sponsor at Fairmont, said Miller had attended the high school for only a year after transferring from DuVal High in Lanham, Md., but fit in immediately. He became a class leader who was â€œalways smiling, always laughing and always caring.â€

â€œTo have this happen to somebody who has so much potential is just a shocking thing,â€ Perry said. â€œHe was a naturally good student. He was just taken away from us too soon.â€

[Tracking D.C. area homicides]

At Millerâ€™s vigil, tearful mourners walked to the middle of the circle, angry that someone in their community focused on success was senselessly killed.

â€œHe was the one who was going away to college to improve his education and his life, and someone took that away,â€ one of his former coaches said. â€œA grown man took away a childâ€™s life.â€

â€œItâ€™s crazy how things go wrong!â€ one girl screamed in frustration. â€œWeâ€™ve got to keep our heads high! We shouldnâ€™t be killing our brothers and sisters!â€

â€œProtect each other,â€ one teacher said. â€œYou canâ€™t fall to the ground if you protect each other.â€

Before the circle broke up, more teachers, coaches and students spoke, urging one another to heed the words from Millerâ€™s essay on gun violence and lift the community.

Miller titled his essay â€œThe Secretâ€ and ended it by asking the reader, â€œSo how do I feel about gun violence? How would I feel if I saw my fellow brother or my fellow sister laid out in the street?â€

He would be filled with hurt, Miller wrote, but also empowered to make a difference with â€œlove and peace.â€",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/a-grown-man-took-away-a-childs-life-college-bound-teen-killed-for-his-iphone-police-say/2018/07/19/1555af68-8b5d-11e8-a345-a1bf7847b375_story.html,"['Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['2', '5', '4', '4', '1']"

How to keep going after a mass shooter kills your husband

John went into the Capital Gazette on a Thursday. The rest is a daze.

The author and her late husband, John McNamara, at Christmas time circa 1997. ((Family photo)/)

The text messages that begin arriving on June 28 end my ordinary life. â€œWhere does your husband work?â€ â€œWhatâ€™s happening in Annapolis?â€ â€œHave you seen the news?â€ My husband, John McNamara, is a reporter for the Capital Gazette. I am at my office, a government agency just outside Washington.

I Google. Then I close my laptop and run toward the parking lot.

I pass one of the new TVs mounted on the walls, where a CNN news crawl says SHOOTING AT ANNAPOLIS CAPITAL. I sit down, perhaps on the floor. I look for Johnâ€™s bright blue shirt in the footage of evacuees. I call his office phone. I call his cellphone. There is no answer.

I know there are times he forgets his phone. I recall each of those times to myself. Then I repeat them to other federal workers passing by.

I call again.

I fight the urge to call again.

I hear about a tweet that says someone is dead. I canâ€™t find it online. I message the alleged tweeter. I receive no reply.

I answer a call from the New York Daily News. The reporter wants to know if I have a statement. â€œAbout what? What do you know?â€ I ask. There is an awkward silence.

I answer a call from the New York Post. â€œWhat do you know?â€ I ask. There is an awkward silence.

I answer a call from â€œGood Morning America.â€ â€œWhat do you know?â€ I ask again. Again, an awkward silence.

A new text shares a family information hotline number set up by some unknown organization of crisis responders. I call. There is no information available from the information hotline. The woman takes my number and promises to call. She invites me to the â€œfamily waiting areaâ€ at a Lord and Taylor store near the newsroom. A friend already in Annapolis goes there and tells me there is no information, no water and no bathrooms in the pen-like area where families are corralled. I prepare to go to my momâ€™s home in Columbia, Md., instead.

I answer a call from the Wall Street Journal. The reporter says John might be â€œamong the injured.â€ I pack a bag with Johnâ€™s New Yorker and Sports Illustrated magazines, mindlessly grab random articles of our clothing, and ready myself to go to area hospitals. I might make it before the gathering crowds block the doors. But first I call hospital staff at Anne Arundel Medical Center, then at the University of Maryland trauma center. Both tell me he is not there.

More texts ask if I saw the interviews with people who were telling Anderson Cooper the names of the dead. This clip is not on the CNN website.

I call the family information hotline. A new voice says no information is available. He takes my number and promises to call.

After seven hours of waiting, I answer another strange number. Several of Johnâ€™s co-workers can be heard on the line. There is wailing: painful, wounded wailing. One voice chokes out the words: â€œHeâ€™s dead.â€ The wailing gets louder. It is my wailing.

After 10 p.m., when Iâ€™m still at momâ€™s, the crisis center representatives arrive at my front door and talk through my video doorbell. The information hotline has finally released the information Iâ€™d already learned. I know, I say. John worked at a newspaper, after all. There is Twitter, after all. There are cellphones. The man and woman on the other side of the doorbell video say the company couldnâ€™t find my phone number. I tell them 14 news organizations desperate for a â€œwidow quoteâ€ were able to find my number.

I get 90 minutes of sleep that night. I cancel work the next day. I cancel my evening work event. I forget to cancel my lunch meeting.

I try to turn down a job transfer that was supposed to take place in July; I canâ€™t possibly start now. They say they understand. I decline an offer to teach a graduate course in the summer semester. They say they understand. I cancel my volunteer work at a local theater. They say they understand.

I cancel my theater tickets. They say they understand and refund my money, even though I had declined the ticket cancellation insurance. I cancel our Bethany Beach vacation. Wyndham says they understand and refund my money, even though I had declined the booking cancellation insurance. I cancel a later trip to an out-of-town wedding. Southwest says they understand and refund my money, even though I had declined the airline cancellation insurance.

I canâ€™t cancel the home repairs, so for the next two days, the old roof comes down and the new roof goes up.

There are more nights of one, two or three hours of sleep. My vacation is replaced with meetings: the crisis center, the grief counselors, the life insurance company. The financial adviser helping me save for my retirement tells me not to sign the papers that arrive in the mail.

The medical examinerâ€™s office takes five days to release the body. I identify John and say my goodbyes. He is recognizable, even though the refrigeration has turned his nose black. I am permitted to see his face, but not his body, through the cocoon of the ice pack; I am not able to take his hand. They donâ€™t tell me where the bullet entered or even how he died.

The city of Annapolis organizes a memorial march June 29. A march the next day in town to support immigrantsâ€™ rights would spontaneously turn into a joint march against gun violence. The Washington Post runs a front-page photo of a marching, weeping widow. It is me. Tonight, two hours of sleep.

I wake up and find flowers, plentiful and fragrant like a funeral home lobby, waiting on the welcome mat. Business cards from Fox and Sinclair News reporters are stuck to my front door. Worried neighbors have left thoughtful cards.

I begin planning the memorial: the programs, the music, the pictures, the urn, the speakers, the properly shocked politicians who offer condolences, the officiant. Guests want time to buy their plane tickets from Detroit, from Denver, from Seattle, from L.A., from Atlanta. I order death certificates and sleep for three hours that night.

There are tweets and texts: Will I queue up this favorite song? Can I include this picture? May the journalists quote me? Can media come? Did I sign this contract? Have I called traffic control? Do mourners get parking passes? Where are the driving directions?

Friends and family pose well-meaning questions: Did I pick up my prescription? Did I order food? Did I order enough food? Is there enough parking? Did I get some sleep? Tonight, two more hours of sleep.

There is no cooking in my house. The fruit goes from the bowl on the table to the refrigerator, and eventually to the trash. There is no time or inclination to eat. Without breakfast, my knees buckle. I ask people to let me reach over them to grab the handrail at the Metro; at the funeral home; when Iâ€™m out for the Fourth of July.

The refrigerator starts to stink. So do the dishes in the sink, and the trash holding the food I couldnâ€™t eat. The laundry aroma wafts from the hamper upstairs, meeting the food odors in the middle of the house. Tonight: two hours of sleep.

I bring in more flowers. I forget to water the flowers. I assemble the gift of the bonsai with the rock garden, and I am annoyed at the assignment until I realize that at least itâ€™s not more flowers.

I forget to water my plants. I forget to eat my vegetables. I forget to charge my phone. I forget how many days in a row I wore these pants. I forget to check messages on the land line. I walk upstairs and forget why, so I walk back downstairs. I do it again.

I use my own ChapStick. I make my own coffee. I pick up his car. I finally sleep, but the phone rings at 8 a.m. I realize my underwear top doesnâ€™t match my underwear bottom. I realize it doesnâ€™t matter. I notice my own cheerful, vacation-themed out-of-office message. I change it and update my timesheet with sick leave.

I have lost weight: I try on my black dress. It is too big. I try on my tight black dress. It is too big. I need to buy something new, and when the cashier asks what the new black dress is for, I cry. She abruptly gives me the employee discount. The hairstylist refuses to let me pay for the haircut. The manicurist looks at my chewed nails and peeled polish and says she will fix it so I can get another husband.

The survivors contact me and tell me he didnâ€™t suffer. But, they warn, never watch the security video.

3126F2F5F9LJDIHLD6470SGS0BOPE1,Virginia gun lobbyist is duped into promoting guns for kids as young as 3 by provocateur Sacha Baron Cohen.,"One of Virginiaâ€™s top gun-rights lobbyists drew criticism from his own supporters Monday after he was duped into promoting guns for children as young as 3 and hawking toys such as a teddy bear with a concealed pistol on a television show.

Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, was among numerous public figures pranked by Sacha Baron Cohen on his new series â€œWho Is America?â€ The creator of Borat and Ali G, characters who conduct outrageous interviews with unsuspecting politicians, burned up social media on Sunday with footage of current and former members of Congress speaking enthusiastically of arming children.

[Bipartisanship in Virginia does not extend to gun legislation]

But no one went further than Van Cleave, who appeared with Cohen â€” who was disguised as an Israeli security expert named Col. Erran Morad â€” in a Nickelodeon-style segment called â€œKinderguardians.â€

Holding a â€œPuppy Pistolâ€ toy, which looks like a pistol inserted into a stuffed dog, Van Cleave explains how to load an ammunition clip: â€œTo feed him, take his lunch box and push it into his tummy like this. Just remember to point Puppy Pistolâ€™s mouth right at the middle of the bad man. If he has a big fat tummy, point at that.â€

Thatâ€™s one of several â€œGunimalsâ€ toys that Van Cleave and the stone-faced Cohen tout for youngsters, along with â€œGunny Rabbitâ€ â€” â€œHeâ€™s ready to put the naughty man on a very long timeout,â€ Van Cleave says â€” and Â­â€œDino-gun,â€ which, Van Cleave warns, â€œeats and spits his candy really, really fast.â€

Van Cleave holds a pink teddy bear called BFF â€” for Best Firearm Forever â€” which contains a handgun with a string attached to the trigger. â€œPull the string on a bad guy,â€ Van Cleave says. â€œMake bang bang.â€

Cohenâ€™s character advocates arming kids as young as 3, and Van Cleave doesnâ€™t disagree.

Van Cleave and the VCDL did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Formed in 1994, the organization has donated nearly $100,000 to Virginia candidates over the past 15 years. It holds an annual rally during General Assembly sessions â€” Van Cleave led the event this year to promote concealed-carry laws and testified against a proposed ban on bump stocks, devices that make guns fire faster.

[When is a license plate more than a license plate? When it has the word â€˜gunâ€™ on it.]

On the VCDL Facebook page, the group posted a long letter that it said Van Cleave had distributed in February, immediately after the segment was filmed. The letter says that Van Cleave realized â€œsomething wasnâ€™t right,â€ but that producers of the film had used â€œluxury accommodations, limousine serviceâ€ and a â€œgenerous monetary allowance . . . to reel me in and to try to make me feel beholden to them.â€

Once on the set, â€œthey use psychological maÂ­nipuÂ­laÂ­tion, as well as lies and tricks to put their victim into comedic situations that subject them to public shame,â€ he wrote, according to the letter on the VCDL Facebook page.

He said he began to get suspicious only five minutes into the interview when the â€œIsraeliâ€ host insisted that schools in that country train children as young as age 4 to use guns. Although Van Cleave said in the letter that he â€œbalkedâ€ at that, the video shows him appearing to sympathize with the suggestion.

At one point, Van Cleave complains that Virginiaâ€™s General Assembly considered a bill this year that would have prohibited children as young as 4 from handling guns. When Cohenâ€™s character expresses indignation, Van Cleave reassures him: â€œWe killed the bill.â€

In the letter, Van Cleave says he wants to sound the alarm to prevent others from being duped by the mysterious filmmakers. While it could just be â€œa comedy which would only play in Israel,â€ he said in the letter, it could also be a stunt by filmmaker Michael Moore â€œor, even worse, a Sacha Baron Cohen-esq â€˜Boratâ€™-type of shock comedy meant to be devastatingly embarrassing.â€

After the first episode of â€œWho Is America?â€ made the rounds online Sunday and then aired on Showtime, Virginia politicians were quick to distance themselves from Van Cleave.

â€œI grew up in and now represent a community where people care a lot about their gun rights, but the idea of arming children is ridiculous,â€ said state Sen. Jill Vogel (R-Fauquier), who received $16,000 last year from Van Cleaveâ€™s group in her unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor.

â€œWhat a buffoon,â€ said state Sen. Bryce Reeves (R-Spotsylvania), who received $5,000 from the group for his 2015 Senate bid. â€œApparently common sense wasnâ€™t issued with his concealed-carry permit. Come on, dude, really?â€

One of the legislatureâ€™s staunchest supporters of gun rights, Reeves said the episode will hurt Van Cleaveâ€™s image but wonâ€™t discredit the VCDL.

Hunting traditions and the gun lobby loom large in Virginia, which boasts both rural expanses and the National Rifle Association headquarters. Gun-control advocates have been unable to get much traction in Richmond, even in the wake of a massacre in 2007 that left 32 victims dead at Virginia Tech. Guns are allowed inside the state Capitol and even in the gallery of the House of Delegates.

On the VCDL Facebook page, the Van Cleave letter had drawn scores of scathing comments from followers.

â€œHow can one be so naive? This was the most ridiculous thing Iâ€™ve seen in a long time, and leadership fell for it hook line &amp; sinker,â€ one follower wrote.

A few came to Van Cleaveâ€™s defense. â€œThe point of this attack is to humiliate and shame the 2nd Amendment supporters,â€ one follower wrote. â€œItâ€™s a massive confidence scheme. Itâ€™s fraudulent and unethical. . . . Stop feeling embarrassed.â€

One political figure familiar with both the Virginia Citizens Defense League and the use of publicity stunts dismissed the whole folderol. Corey Stewart, the Republican nominee trying to unseat Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), put the blame on Sacha Baron Cohen.

â€œI think itâ€™s just disgusting and we shouldnâ€™t pay him [Cohen] any attention,â€ said Stewart, who received $11,000 from the VCDL last year in his failed bid for the GOP nomination for governor.

338431Z1FMXQ1MAPKCBSAZAL5HIRO7,Brett Kavanaugh prepares for Senate confirmation hearings,"WASHINGTON - Brett Kavanaugh begins his Senate confirmation hearings to the Supreme Court Tuesday, with Democrats vowing a grilling that produces ""sparks.""

Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee intend to make the case that Kavanaugh would overturn abortion rights, scuttle Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian meddling in US elections, limit gun control and weaken Obamacare.

Several potential 2020 presidential candidates - Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) - are sure to make the most of their chance to question Kavanaugh on national TV.

""There will be sparks at this hearing,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told reporters last week.

Kavanaugh, however, has math on his side.

Once Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey appoints a successor to Sen. John McCain, the GOP will hold a 51 to 49 majority in the Senate. In the event of a 50-50 tie, Vice President Pence would cast the deciding vote for Kavanaugh.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) predicted Sunday Kavanaugh would convince red-state Democrats facing re-election in November to come on board.

""If he does well at the hearing, he will get, my belief is 55 (votes) or higher,"" Graham told ""Fox News Sunday.""

Already with strong GOP support, Kavanaugh's goal is to avoid making news. Like past nominees, he's expected to dodge specific questions on how he'd rule on potential cases like abortion, gun control and campaign finance.

""They (senators) know very well that judges cannot answer questions about cases that are likely to come before them,"" Carrie Severino, policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network, told ""Fox and Friends"" Monday. The conservative group has poured millions into TV ads supporting Kavanaugh.

""...The 2020 contenders are going to want to get more and more tape of him saying 'sorry, I can't answer that.' They are looking to film campaign videos, they are not really actually trying to get information.""

If Kavanaugh earns confirmation he'll replace swing-vote Justice Anthony Kennedy and cement the court's 5-4 conservative majority. Liberal activists are outraged and have suggested Democrats just walk out of the ""sham"" hearings.

Democrats have raised red flags with several of Kavanaugh's previous writings, like his belief sitting presidents should be protected from criminal investigations.

The hearings are expected to past three or four days.",https://nypost.com/2018/09/03/brett-kavanaugh-prepares-for-senate-confirmation-hearings/,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Republican', 'Republican', 'Strongly Republican']","['3', '2', '3', '1', '3']"
3OID399FXHP2UZER38XIIGK3Y6SDFB,Kavanaugh's staunch gun-rights defense among hundreds of decisions in spotlight,"Hundreds of Brett Kavanaughâ€™s decisions are now in the spotlight after President Trump formally selected him to fill former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's seat.

Kavanaugh, 53, formerly clerked for Kennedy and was elevated to the powerful federal appeals court in the District of Columbia by former President George W. Bush, under whom he had also served as a White House lawyer and staff secretary.

In his 12 years as a judge, Kavanaugh has issued approximately 300 opinions and delivered numerous speeches and legal arguments. Among them is his dissenting opinion on a pivotal gun ban in 2001.

In Heller v. District of Columbia, the D.C. Circuit Court upheld the Districtâ€™s ordinance banning most semi-automatic rifles. But in that case, Kavanaugh wrote the dissenting opinion, arguing the Supreme Court had already decided handguns â€“ â€œthe vast majority of which today are semi-automaticâ€ â€“ are constitutionally protected under the Second Amendment.

He said despite gun violence in the area, â€œour task is to apply the Constitution and the precedents of the Supreme Court, regardless of whether the result is one we agree with as a matter of first principles or policy.â€

The Supreme Court eventually took the case and struck down the ordinance; it held that the Second Amendment protects the possession of semi-automatic weapons for purposes unrelated to militia use.

The National Rifle Association applauded Kavanaughâ€™s nomination as its president, Chris W. Cox, cited his â€œimpressive record that demonstrates his strong support for the Second Amendment.â€

On the other side, the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence derided the pick, saying he has â€œissued prior rulings that are ideologically aligned with the gun lobby and reflect a radical interpretation of the Constitution under which public safety justifications play no role in Second Amendment jurisprudence.â€

But aside from gun-related legislation, lawmakers will have to sift through Kavanaughâ€™s rulings on countless other issues as they decide whether to confirm him to the nationâ€™s highest court. Read on for a look at other opinions or decisions Kavanaugh is sure to be asked about as he goes before the Senate for his confirmation hearing.

Abortion

Although he has not expressed outright opposition to abortion, liberals have already warned of the end of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, should Kavanaugh be confirmed.

Kavanaugh did, however, issue a dissent in a 2017 case involving an illegal immigrant who wished to be released from custody in order to obtain an abortion. While the court eventually allowed her to have the procedure, Kavanaugh said the majority opinion was â€œradically inconsistent with 40 years of Supreme Court precedent.â€

A LOOK AT THE SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION PROCESS

He argued if the government helped the 17-year-old obtain an abortion, then it ignores its ""permissible interest in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of a minor and refraining from facilitating abortion.â€

Despite his dissent, Kavanaughâ€™s words irked some anti-abortion conservatives who felt as though he did not go far enough. During oral arguments, Kavanaugh suggested releasing the teen to a sponsor which would â€œsolve the governmentâ€™s objectionâ€ and allow her to get an abortion.

Phillip Jauregui, president of the Judicial Action Group, said the case â€œexemplifies why Kavanaugh is not the best available Supreme Court prospectâ€ in a memo last month.

Trump has said he did not discuss abortion with Kavanaugh.

The Womenâ€™s March called the choice of Kavanaugh â€œa death sentence for thousands of women in the United States.â€

â€œStripping a womanâ€™s ability to make decisions about her own body is state violence,â€ the group said. â€œWe cannot let this stand. We will raise our voices and take to the streets.â€

ObamaCare

Kavanaughâ€™s role in an ObamaCare decision had some conservatives on edge prior to his official nomination. As Fox News previously reported, Kavanaugh ultimately dissented in Seven-Sky v. Holder, a challenge to the Affordable Care Act.

However, in his dissent, Kavanaugh did acknowledge the Affordable Care Actâ€™s â€œindividual mandate provisionâ€ could fit â€œcomfortably within Congressâ€™ Taxing Clause power.â€

Conservative health care expert Christopher Jacobs argued Kavanaugh â€œcultivated a theoryâ€ that paved the way for Chief Justice John Roberts to uphold the individual mandate requiring people to purchase health insurance in 2012.

WHO IS BRETT KAVANAUGH?

â€œEven as he avoided a definitive ruling on the merits of the case, Kavanaugh revealed himself as favorably disposed to the mandate,â€ Jacobs wrote for The Federalist.

Religious liberty

In 2015, Kavanaugh sided with organizations that argued ObamaCareâ€™s contraceptive coverage mandate infringed upon their religious rights.

â€œWhen the Government forces someone to take an action contrary to his or her sincere religious belief (here, submitting the form) or else suffer a financial penalty (which here is huge), the Government has substantially burdened the individualâ€™s exercise of religion,â€ Kavanaugh wrote in the dissenting opinion in Priests for Life v. HHS.

At issue here was the form organizations were required to provide to the insurer or federal government in order to be exempt from a monetary penalty levied if they did not wish to include contraceptives in their insurance coverage. After a form is filed, then the insurer will still offer contraceptive coverage for employees through separate funds provided by the government or insurer. But religious organizations argued it made them complicit in providing coverage for contraceptives, thus violating their religious beliefs.

KAVANAUGH NOD TOUCHES OFF SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION BATTLE; DEMS WARN OF â€˜DEATHS OF COUNTLESS WOMENâ€™

Russell Moore, president of the Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said he is â€œconfidentâ€ Kavanaugh â€œwill be a strong defender of the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and Bill of Rights, especially our First Freedom of religious liberty.â€

Presidential protections

Kavanaugh worked with Kenneth Starr in the 1990s, co-writing the independent counselâ€™s report laying out the legal framework supporting then-President Bill Clintonâ€™s impeachment. He said Clinton should be impeached because he misled the public and lied to his staff, according to The New York Times.

But in 2009, citing his role with the investigation into Clinton, Kavanaugh expressed his opinion that presidents should not have to deal with criminal investigations or civil lawsuits while in office.

WHO ARE THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES?

Writing for the Minnesota Law Review, Kavanaugh said, â€œI think we grossly underestimate how difficult the job [of U.S. president] is.â€ Because of that, he said he believes â€œ[it's] vital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible.â€

""The nation certainly would have been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots."" - Brett Kavanaugh

â€œLooking back to the late 1990s, for example, the nation certainly would have been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots,â€ Kavanaugh said.

Kavanaugh said criminal investigations and civil lawsuits should simply be deferred â€“ not eliminated â€“ until he is out of office.

â€œEven the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation â€“ including preparing for questioning by criminal investigators â€“ are time-consuming and distracting. Like civil suits, criminal investigations take the Presidentâ€™s focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people,â€ he said. â€œAnd a President who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as President.â€

36GJS3V78W8LBLAEOOPB3ZFS4GJJGA,Justice Department charges Russian who eyed NRA as a foreign agent,"Close video Maddow: Time for Americans to face 'worst case scenario' on Trump Rachel Maddow notes that what ultimately explains a host of inexplicable developments in the story of the Donald Trump campaign is the worst case scenario that Trump is compromised by Russia, and points to the unfolding legal case as a guide for how to share tweet email save Embed

The gun-loving former aide to a top Russian official has been arrested and charged with being a foreign agent who conspired with her ex-boss to infiltrate politically powerful U.S. organizations and push Moscowâ€™s agenda. Mariia Butina, 29, who came to the U.S. in August 2016 on a student visa, previously served as a special assistant to a Kremlin crony whose description in court papers matches that of Alexander Torshin.

Late last week, the Justice Department filed criminal charges against 12 Russian intelligence officials for their role in allegedly attacking the U.S. elections in 2016. Yesterday, federal prosecutors charged another Russian, but this story is a little different. NBC News reported yesterday:

If Torshinâ€™s name sounds familiar, thereâ€™s a reason for that: McClatchy News reported earlier this year that the FBI is exploring whether â€œa top Russian banker with ties to the Kremlin illegally funneled moneyâ€ to the National Rifle Association to help Donald Trump win the presidency. The specific focus was reportedly the activities of Alexander Torshin, the deputy governor of Russiaâ€™s central bank, a close Putin ally, and someone whoâ€™s faced allegations of money laundering and connections to organized crime.

Mariia Butina, by all accounts, is a Torshin protÃ©gÃ©, who worked to establish connections to the NRA and prominent figures in American conservative politics.

And now Butina is facing federal criminal charges, with the Justice Department accusing her of working as a Russian foreign agent â€“ at the direction of Torshin â€“ and trying to establish â€œbackchannelâ€ lines of communication with American politicians in order to advance Putinâ€™s agenda in the United States.

More to the point, the new indictment appears to describe an effort, backed by the Russian government, to use Butina and Torshin to influence Republican politics â€“ using the NRA in particular as a point of leverage.

According to the charges, Butina put together a blueprint on how she intended to move forward with her influence operation: in 2015, she said she expected Republicans to control the U.S. government after the 2016 elections. Her plan went on to say that while the Republican Party has traditionally been hostile toward Russia, Butina believed there was an opportunity to cultivate relations because of a â€œright to negotiate.â€

Why did she think Russians had a â€œright to negotiateâ€ on future Republican policies? What made Butina so confident of a GOP takeover following the 2016 elections? Who were the Americans Butina was in contact with during her intelligence operation?

We donâ€™t know, but as the legal proceedings unfold, itâ€™s likely weâ€™ll find out.

Rachel added on the show last night that, at its core, these new charges are a â€œcollusion indictment,â€ filed by the FBI and the national security division of the Justice Department, which alleges that â€œan agent of the Russian government was working in Republican and conservative politics in this country to, among other things, set up secret contacts and secret lines of communication with the Kremlin â€“ with support from, and approval from, Vladimir Putin.â€

And at the heart of the plan was Russiaâ€™s intention to use the NRA as a vehicle.

3K3IX1W4S79GN509X12L49Q1F9IAP9,Chaos Grips Senate Hearing on Trump Supreme Court Pick Kavanaugh,"The Senate confirmation hearing for Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's U.S. Supreme Court pick, descended into chaos on Tuesday, as Democrats protested about Republicans blocking access to documents concerning the nominee's White House work more than a decade ago.

With Democratic senators repeatedly interrupting the Judiciary Committee's Republican chairman Chuck Grassley at the outset of the hearing and dozens of shouting protesters removed one by one by security personnel, the session quickly became a ruckus.

""This is the first confirmation for a Supreme Court justice I've seen, basically, according to mob rule,"" Republican Senator John Cornyn said, a characterization Democrats rejected.

""What we've heard is the noise of democracy,"" Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said.

News photographers clicked pictures of a smiling Kavanaugh - the conservative federal appeals court judge picked by Trump for a lifetime job on the top U.S. judicial body - as he entered the hearing room with family members. But moments after Grassley opened the session, Democrats decried the withholding of the documents and asked to have the proceedings adjourned.

Protesters, mostly women, took turns yelling as senators spoke, shouting, ""This is a travesty of justice,"" ""Our democracy is broken"" and ""Vote no on Kavanaugh."" Demonstrators voiced concern about what they saw as the threat posed by Kavanaugh to abortion rights, healthcare access and gun control.

""We cannot possibly move forward. We have not had an opportunity to have a meaningful hearing,"" Democratic Senator Kamala Harris said. Democratic Senator Cory Booker appealed to Grassley's ""sense of decency and integrity"" and said the withholding of the documents by Republicans and the White House left lawmakers unable to properly vet Kavanaugh.

Grassley called the Democrats' request to halt the hearing ""out of order"" and accused them of obstruction. Republicans hold a slim Senate majority and can confirm Kavanaugh if they stay united. There were no signs of Republican defections.

If confirmed, Kavanaugh is expected to move the court - which already had a conservative majority - further to the right. Senate Democratic leaders have vowed a fierce fight to try to block his confirmation. Democrats signaled they would press Kavanaugh on abortion, gun rights and presidential power when they get to question him on Wednesday in a hearing due to run through Friday.

Republican Orrin Hatch accused Democratic senators of political opportunism, noting, ""We have folks who want to run for president,"" though he did not mention any by name. There has been speculation Booker and Harris might consider 2020 presidential runs.

Hatch grew visibly irritated as protesters interrupted him.

""I think we ought to have this loudmouth removed,"" Hatch said.

Trump nominated Kavanaugh, 53, to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement on June 27.

Democrats have demanded in vain to see documents relating Kavanaugh's time as staff secretary to Republican former President George W. Bush from 2003 to 2006. That job involved managing paper flow from advisers to Bush. Republicans also have released some, but not all, documents concerning Kavanaugh's two prior years as a lawyer in Bush's White House Counsel's Office.

Republicans have said Democrats have more than enough documents to assess Kavanaugh's record, including his 12 years of judicial opinions as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Kavanaugh sat, fingers intertwined, quietly staring ahead at the committee members as protesters in the audience screamed while being dragged out of the room. He occasionally jotted notes on paper.

""A good judge must be an umpire - a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy,"" Kavanaugh said in written remarks released in advance of the hearing. ""I don't decide cases based on personal or policy preferences.""

As the hearing paused for a lunch break, Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter who was killed in the Parkland, Florida high school mass shooting in February, tried to talk to Kavanaugh but the nominee turned away. Video of the encounter was shared widely on social media.

There is a long history of heated fights over U.S. Supreme Court nominations, with anger in both parties. But the Democratic frustrations that boiled over on Tuesday had been simmering for more than two years.

Democrats have accused Senate Republican leaders of stealing a Supreme Court seat by refusing to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama's nominee to the high court Merrick Garland in 2016, allowing Trump to fill a Supreme Court vacancy instead.

Republicans also last year reduced the margin for advancing Supreme Court nominations from 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to a simple majority in order to force through the confirmation of Trump's first high court nominee Neil Gorsuch.

Grassley sought to turn the attention to Kavanaugh's qualifications, calling him ""one of the most qualified nominees - if not the most qualified nominee - I have seen.""

The Senate is likely to vote on confirmation by the end of September. The court begins its next term in October.

The hearing gave Democrats a platform to make their case against Kavanaugh ahead of November's congressional elections in which they are seeking to seize control of Congress from Republicans.

Liberals are concerned Kavanaugh could provide a decisive fifth vote on the nine-justice court to overturn or weaken the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion nationwide.

Kavanaugh is likely to be questioned about his views on investigating sitting presidents and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion between Moscow and Trump's campaign.

""I find it difficult to imagine that your views on this subject escaped the attention of President Trump, who seems increasingly fixated on his own ballooning legal jeopardy,"" Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy said.

Republican Senator Jeff Flake, a frequent Trump critic, said he shared Democratic concerns about how Kavanaugh sees the U.S. government's separation of powers and the rule of law.",https://ijr.com/2018/09/1121107-scotus-kavanaugh-hearing-day-one/,"['Republican', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic']","['2', '3', '3', '1', '3']"

â— AZ-Sen: Local GOP pollster OH Predictive Insights' newest poll of the late August GOP primary gives Rep. Martha McSally a 39-25 lead over former state Sen. Kelli Ward, with disgraced former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio bringing up the rear at 14. That's a big shift from April when they had Ward leading McSally 36-27, while Arpaio was at 22. The only other primary poll we've seen in months was a late May McSally internal that gave her a 42-25 lead over Arpaio while Ward took 23.

â— CA-Sen, CA-Gov: The Los Angeles Times and University of Southern California are out with the first poll of California's general elections. In the all-Democratic Senate race, they find Sen. Dianne Feinstein leading state Sen. Kevin de Leon 36-18, with 46 percent undecided; Feinstein led de Leon 44-12 in the June 5 top-two primary. In the race for governor, they unsurprisingly have Democrat Gavin Newsom leading Republican John Cox 45-28.

â— IN-Sen: Republican Mike Braun is up another TV spot where he once again says he treated his employees at his business well. Braun also echoes a recent ad from his allies at the Senate Leadership Fund when he declares that ""unlike Sen. Joe Donnelly's family, we'd never send jobs to Mexico."" As we recently wrote, Donnelly has long maintained, going back to his first successful bid for Congress in 2006, that he hasn't had an active role in the family business since 1997.

â— WI-Sen: Marquette gives us our first general election poll here in months, and they give Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin a clear lead against both her prospective GOP foes. Baldwin leads businessman Kevin Nicholson 50-39, and she has a similar 49-40 edge against state Sen. Leah Vukmir. Marquette also took a look at the GOP primary, but their sample of 264 voters is below the 300 minimum we require to include in the Digest.

Gubernatorial

â— FL-Gov: Former Rep. Gwen Graham is out with her second TV ad ahead of the late August Democratic primary. The narrator reminds the audience that Graham's father, former Gov. Bob Graham, expanded health care ""from infants to the elderly."" Gwen Graham then hits the GOP legislature for refusing to take Medicaid expansion, and pledges to do it as governor. Florida Politics says that both her ads are only running in Tampa Bay and Orlando, which together cover about 45 percent of the state.

â— ME-Gov: Right as we were putting the Digest to bed, election officials in Maine declared that state Attorney General Janet Mills had won the instant runoff in the Democratic primary for governor, beating businessman Adam Cote 54-46 in the final round. She'll face Republican businessman Shawn Moody in the fall. We'll have more on this first-of-its-kind election in the next Digest.

â— OK-Gov: Wealthy businessman Kevin Stitt is out with a new spot ahead of next week's crowded GOP primary, where he promotes himself as the only candidate who isn't a career politician and argues that voters unhappy with the state's current path of ""wasted tax dollars and letting our students down"" should go for him.

We haven't had any polls here over the last month, but new campaign finance reports show that Stitt has outspent his many rivals in the homestretch of the campaign. Stitt, who has self-funded much of his campaign, spent $2.4 million from April 1 through June 11, a bit ahead of the $1.8 million that Lt. Gov. Todd Lamb deployed during this period. Former Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett expended $894,000, while wealthy former U.S. Attorney Gary Richardson spent a considerably smaller $416,000. Former state Rep. Dan Fisher spent just shy of $100,000, while state Auditor Gary Jones dropped only $41,000.

There would be an August runoff in the very likely event that no one takes a majority, but it's anyone's guess who would be in it. A late May Sooner Poll showed Lamb taking first with 23, while Cornett led Stitt 20-14 for second. Richardson, who only took 3 percent in that poll, responded with his own survey that found Lamb at 20 and Stitt at 17, while Richardson and Cornett each were close behind at 13. Whomever emerges with the GOP nod this summer will likely face former Attorney General Drew Edmondson, the heavy favorite to win the Democratic primary next week.

â— SC-Gov: Donald Trump and Mike Pence have announced that they'll each be stumping for Gov. Henry McMaster ahead of his Tuesday GOP primary runoff showdown with wealthy businessman John Warren. Pence will drop by Saturday, while Trump will visit on Election Day eve.

â— WI-Gov: Marquette's new poll takes a look at both the August Democratic primary for Wisconsin governor and hypothetical general election matchups against Republican incumbent Scott Walker, whom they find leading most of the Democrats by small margins.

In the primary portion of the poll, which featured a sample of 318 voters, Marquette finds state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers far ahead of his many rivals with 25 percent of the vote, while everyone else is in single digits. Three candidates take second with 7 percent each: former party chair Matt Flynn, campaign finance reform activist Mike McCabe, and Madison Mayor Paul Soglin. None of the other candidatesâ€”six of 'em, for a grand total of 10â€”takes more than 5 percent, and a 34 percent plurality of voters are undecided.

One of those bringing up the rear is former state Rep. Kelda Helen Roys, who sits at a mere 2 percent. However, Wednesday also brought her some much better news when EMILY's List endorsed her. Roys is one of two women in the race, but the other, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, has a wobbly record on reproductive rights.

In the general election, Walker earns anywhere from 44 to 49 percent of the vote, while his Democrat foes take between 36 and 44. Walker edges Evers 48-44 and holds a 48-40 lead over Roys, though his closest matchup comes against McCabe, whom he beats just 44-42. The only other recent general election poll we've seen was a May survey for Evers that gave him a 49-45 lead over the governor, though he did not release results testing Walker against any other Democrats.

However, one thing to note is that Marquette divided up its sample in a somewhat unusual way. They asked all 800 respondents about hypothetical Walker vs. Evers and Walker vs. Roys matchups, but they then split the remaining eight pairings in half, so that each responded was only asked about five total gubernatorial head-to-heads. That makes it somewhat more difficult to compare the results for candidates like McCabe, who weren't presented to the full panel, and the related margins of error are higher.

House

â— AZ-02: Late on Tuesday, a state court judge rejected a challenge to Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick's candidacy for Arizona's 2nd Congressional District, ruling that the former congresswoman is in fact a resident of Tucson, as she had said on her nominating petitions. Kirkpatrick's main rival in the August primary, former state Rep. Matt Heinz, had filed a lawsuit charging that Kirkpatrick actually lives in Phoenix, which is far from the 2nd District but is close to the 1st, which Kirkpatrick represented until her unsuccessful Senate bid in 2016.

While congressional candidates aren't required to live in the districts they're seeking to represent, Heinz had argued that Kirkpatrick misled voters by listing on her petitions an address in Tucson, which is the main city in the 2nd District. However, the judge hearing the case disagreed and ruled that Kirkpatrick can remain on the ballot, though an appeal is possible. Ironically, Heinz himself lives in a part of Tucson that's actually in the 3rd District.

â— CA-48: Orange County counted most of its remaining ballots on Tuesday evening from the June 5 top-two primary, and real estate company owner Harley Rouda was left holding a 69-vote edge over biologist and fellow Democrat Hans Keirstead in contest to take on GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher. There are still some uncounted ballots, but Orange County Registrar of Voters Neal Kelly says only a few hundred of them are in the 48th District. The county is scheduled to finish its count Saturday and certify the results on Monday.

Keirstead, who was leading from the day after Election Day until Monday, has not conceded defeat, nor has he ruled out seeking a recount. Under state law, any candidate can pay for a recount, which Kelly estimates would take 15 to 30 days to conduct at $8,000 to $10,000 per day.

â— IL-06: GOP Rep. Peter Roskam's first ad, which Politico recently reported was running on cable for $165,000, is now available. A local man named David Rash, who is shown getting around in his wheelchair, tells the audience that ""some in Congress wanted to weaken the Americans with Disabilities Act,"" which would have made it tougher for people like him to get access to public spaces. Rash praises Roskam for listening when he reached out and opposing his own party to deliver.

â— ND-AL: Mason-Dixon's new survey gives Republican Kelly Armstrong a 46-35 lead over Democrat Mac Schneider in the open-seat race for this statewide House seat; this same sample had GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer ahead 48-44 against Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. While both parties are planning to spend plenty of money in the Senate race, no major outside groups have reserved airtime for the House race.

â— NY-11: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce recently went up with a spot for Rep. Dan Donovan ahead of next week's GOP primary, and we now know the size of the buy was $350,000.

â— NY-19: U.S. Agency for International Development official Erin Collier is out with the only poll we've seen of next week's Democratic primary to face GOP Rep. John Faso. The Change Research survey, which was done over the weekend, gives attorney Antonio Delgado the lead with 21 percent, while businessman Brian Flynn and Army veteran Pat Ryan each are in second with 14 percent. Former diplomat Jeff Beals takes 9, while Collier and attorney and Deacon David Clegg are behind with 5 percent each.

It's pretty surprising that Collier would release a poll showing her so far behind. The memo does argue that she'd close the gap once voters learn more about her, but Collier has almost no time left to get her name out. Collier also had just $57,000 in the bank in early June, so she can't exactly saturate the airwaves in the final days of the campaign. Meanwhile, Ryan's allies at VoteVets are spending another $84,000 on a TV buy for him.

â— PA-01: This week, the state ALF-CIO endorsed GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick. The group backed Republicans in 16 state legislative races, but Fitzpatrick was the only one of Team Red's congressional candidates to get their seal of approval.

â— SC-04: The Club for Growth has endorsed former state Sen. Lee Bright days ahead of next week's GOP primary runoff for this safely red seat, and they've launched what they say is a $230,000 TV and digital buy against state Sen. William Timmons. One ad begins with the narrator asking the audience what Timmons said about the gas tax before it shows a clip of him declaring, ""We could raise it 30 cents. I don't care."" The other 15-second spot uses the same clip, but throws in another where Timmons says, ""I'm in. I don't even need tax reform.""

However, another outside group is coming to Timmons' aid. CLA Inc, which stands for the Conservative Leadership Alliance, is dropping $266,000 on a media buy for Timmons, which is not online yet. CLA and the Club have come into conflict in primaries a few times this cycle.

â— WV-03: Monmouth finds Democratic state Sen. Richard Ojeda in surprisingly good shape for the general election in West Virginia's 3rd Congressional District, a coal country seat that backed Donald Trump 73-23 but still sometimes favors Democrats down the ballot. Monmouth's ""potential voters"" model (we explain what each of their models is in our WV-Sen item above) finds Ojeda leading Republican state Del. Carol Miller 43-41. Ojeda's lead expands to 47-41 under their historical midterm turnout model, and goes all the way to 48-39 with their Democratic surge model.

Ojeda, an Iraq veteran who was brutally beaten at a campaign event in 2016, also won his first term 59-41 as his state Senate seat was going for Trump 78-19, so he has experience winning some very red turf. (Ojeda himself told the New Yorker ahead of the 2016 election that he was backing Trump.) Still, it's very surprising he's doing this well in this poll in a seat this pro-Trump, but this seat had voted for only a single non-presidential Republican from 1930 until 2014.

Part of Ojeda's appeal may be because of his profile, which has helped him gain attention from plenty of national outlets. However, Monmouth finds that both candidates have very similar favorable ratings, with Ojeda's 33-14 score not that different from Miller's 27-10. (Those numbers come from the potential voters model.)

As we always say, you should never let one poll determine your view of a race, even when there is literally one poll to go off of. So far, neither national party has run any ads here or reserved fall air time, so they're at least not acting like this is a very competitive race. Even if Ojeda is ahead or close at this point, he'll need to be prepared for the GOP's attempts to tie him to unpopular national Democrats.

P.S. Monmouth also released general election matchups for West Virginia's other two House seats, but both sample sizes are well under 300, which is the minimum number we require to include in the Digest.

â— House: In an unexpected but welcome development for Democrats, the New York Times reported on Wednesday that Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, plans to spend $80 million of his personal fortune to help the party win back the House this fall. Bloomberg was first elected as a Republican but later became an independent and has regularly supported candidates from both parties, so his decision to go all-in on one side is notable.

Bloomberg is particularly well-known in the political world for his efforts to reduce gun violence, and he's sometimes showed up as an NRA bogeyman in races where gun rights have taken central stage. His advisors seem to grasp that problem: While a target list hasn't been set, the Times says Bloomberg intends to focus on moderate suburban districts rather than ""rural, conservative-leaning districts where his views on guns and other issues could stir an uproar.""

Bloomberg himself says he still intends to support some Republicans, including at the gubernatorial level, but in a statement, he was unambiguous in wanting a Democratic House. Of course, while $80 million seems like a gigantic sum, the Koch brothers have promised to spend $400 million on the midterms, and needless to say, no democracy should be subject to the whims of billionaires. But unilateral disarmament is not an option, and Bloomberg's money, if it's deployed wisely, will be a boon to Democrats.",https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/6/21/1773976/-Morning-Digest-Independent-poll-finds-Democrat-Joe-Manchin-ahead-in-West-Virginia-Senate-race,"['Neutral', 'Republican', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral']","['1', '2', '1', '4', '1']"

In Florida, it happened again.

Six months after a shooting rampage in Parkland brought the debate over gun violence to the forefront, the state was the site of another spree Sunday â€“ this time at a bustling entertainment complex on the banks of the St. Johns River in Jacksonville.

Two people were killed and 11 were injured when a gunman opened fire during a Madden 19 video game tournament at the GLHF Game Bar, sheriff's officials said. The gunman also killed himself.

2018 has seen several high-profile mass shootings: Five people gunned down in the newsroom of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, on June 28; 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Valentine's Day; 10 people fatally shot at Santa Fe High School on May 18; and four people killed at a Waffle House in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 22. The Parkland shooting launched a youth-led movement for gun control.

The FBI defines mass killings as four or more being killed, not including suspects, in an event. The killing may stretch over a day or more and some distance, especially if it includes killings committed in flight or against targeted people. It does not include an extended ""cooling-off period"" to distinguish this kind of crime from the acts of serial killers.

Here is a look at other shooting sprees in the U.S.:

â€¢ June 12, 2016: Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old security guard, kills 49 people and wounds 58 others at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that was hosting a Latin night. Mateen was killed by police. It was the deadliest terror attack in the U.S. since 9/11 and at the time was the worst mass shooting in the nation by a single gunman.

â€¢ April 16, 2007: Seung Hui Cho, a 23-year-old student, went on a shooting spree at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, killing 32 people, before killing himself.

â€¢ Dec. 14, 2012: Adam Lanza, 20, gunned down 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School before killing himself.

â€¢ Oct. 16, 1991: George Hennard, 35, crashed his pickup through the wall of Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen, Texas. He shot and killed 23 people before committing suicide.

â€¢ July 18, 1984: James Huberty, 41, gunned down 21 adults and children at a McDonald's in San Ysidro, California, before being killed by police.

â€¢ Aug. 1, 1966: Charles Joseph Whitman, a former U.S. Marine, shot and killed 16 people from a university tower at the University of Texas in Austin before being shot by police.

â€¢ Aug. 20, 1986: A part-time mail carrier, Patrick Henry Sherrill, shot and killed 14 postal workers in Edmund, Oklahoma, before killing himself.

â€¢ Dec. 2, 2015: Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, a married couple living in Redlands, California, opened fire at a San Bernardino County Department of Public Health training event and holiday party, killing 14 people and injuring 22 in a matter of minutes. Farook, an American-born U.S. citizen of Pakistani descent, worked at the health department. Malik had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in a Facebook post before the shooting.

â€¢ Nov. 5, 2009: U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan fatally shot 13 people and injured 30 others at Fort Hood near Killeen, Texas. Hasan, a psychiatrist, appeared to have been radicalized by an Islamic cleric. He was convicted and sentenced to death.

â€¢ Sept. 16, 2013: Gunman Aaron Alexis, 34, fatally shot 12 people and injured three others at the headquarters of the Naval Sea Systems Command in Washington, D.C. He was later killed by police.

â€¢ July 20, 2012: James Holmes gunned down 12 people in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater. Last year he was convicted of first-degree murder and attempted murder and sentenced to 12 consecutive life sentences plus 3,318 years without parole.

â€¢ Oct. 1, 2015: Christopher Harper-Mercer, a 26-year-old student at Umpqua Community College near Roseburg, Oregon, shot an assistant professor and eight students in a classroom. After a shootout with police, he committed suicide.

â€¢ June 18, 2015: A gunman opened fire at a weekly Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Nine people were killed, including pastor Clementa Pinckney; a 10th victim survived. The morning after the attack, police arrested a suspect, Dylann Roof, 21, who said he wanted to start a race war. In December 2016, Roof was convicted of 33 federal hate crimes charges, and in January he was sentenced to death.

â€¢ July 16, 2015: Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez opened fire on two military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The first was a drive-by shooting at a recruiting center; the second was at a U.S. Navy Reserve center. Four Marines and a Navy sailor died; a Marine recruit officer and a police offer were wounded. Abdulazeez was killed by police in a gunfight.

â€¢ Nov. 27, 2015: A gunman attacked a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, killing a police officer and two civilians and injuring nine others. Robert Lewis Dear was taken into custody after a five-hour standoff and charged with first-degree murder.

Associated Press reporter Chad Day explains why Butina's case is significant. (July 18) AP

In this photo taken on Sunday, April 21, 2013, Maria Butina, leader of a pro-gun organization in Russia, speaks to a crowd during a rally in support of legalizing the possession of handguns in Moscow, Russia. Butina, a 29-year-old gun-rights activist, served as a covert Russian agent while living in Washington, gathering intelligence on American officials and political organizations and working to establish back-channel lines of communications for the Kremlin, federal prosecutors charged Monday, July 16, 2018. (Photo: AP)

WASHINGTON â€“ A federal magistrate Wednesday ordered that a Russian national, accused earlier this week of infiltrating American political organizations including the National Rifle Association, be held without bond pending trial.

Magistrate Deborah Robinson sided with federal prosecutors who argued that Maria Butina, 29, represented an â€œextremeâ€ risk of flight from the country.

Robinson said there was â€œno condition or combination of conditions that could assureâ€ Butinaâ€™s return to court where she faces two felony charges, one of which carries a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison.

Butina, dressed in a short-sleeved orange jumpsuit, did not visibly react to the judge's decision before leaving the second-floor courtroom with two federal marshals.

CLOSE Prosecutors say a 29-year-old gun-rights activist who's suspected of being a covert Russian agent was likely in contact with Kremlin operatives while living in the United States. (July 18) AP

In court papers filed in advance of Butina's detention hearing here, prosecutors asserted that Butina engaged in a years-long campaign as a covert agent for the Kremlin in an attempt to ""advance the interests of her home country.""

""The defendant's covert influence campaign involved substantial planning, international coordination and preparation,"" prosecutors argued. ""The plan for Butina also required, and she demonstrated, a willingness to use deceit in a visa application to move to the United States and bring the plan to fruition.""

During the hearing, Butinaâ€™s attorney, Robert Driscoll entered a plea of not guilty on behalf of his client.

He also rejected the governmentâ€™s assertion that Butina was a flight risk.

Driscoll said Butina had made no effort to return to Russia during the past year, despite the close scrutiny of the FBI. Among the evidence presented Wednesday was an FBI surveillance photo of Butina dining with a suspected Russian intelligence officer.

â€œMs. Butina is not a proxy for all of the serious issues we have with Russia,â€ Driscoll told the magistrate.

Citing FBI surveillance conducted during the past week, prosecutors said Butina had access to thousands of dollars and ""an intention to move money out of the U.S.""

At the time of her weekend arrest, federal agents said Butina's apartment was packed with boxes ""consistent with a move.""

""All of Butina's known personal ties, save for those U.S. persons she attempted to exploit and influence, reside in the Russian Federation,"" the court documents state.

The court documents, however, do refer to a romantic relationship with a 56-year-old U.S. person who prosecutors asserted was used by Butina to access ""an extensive network"" of other influential Americans.

The relationship did not appear to represent ""a strong tie to the United States,"" because prosecutors alleged that Butina allegedly offered a separate U.S. person sex in exchange for a job with an undisclosed ""special interest organization.

While neither of the U.S. persons were identified in court documents, the 56-year-old boyfriend appeared to match the description of South Dakota Republican political operative Paul Erickson, who has been publicly linked with Butina.

The two are listed in South Dakota state records as agents for a business known as Bridges LLC.

Butina's attorney also indicated Wednesday that the packing boxes observed by the FBI in Butina's apartment were in preparation for a move to South Dakota â€“ not back to Russia â€“ where Driscoll said she intended to live with her boyfriend.

Butina has remained in custody since her Sunday arrest.

During her time in the U.S., prosecutors argued that in addition to her dinner with the suspected Russian intelligence agents, Butina was in contact with other Russian operatives, perhaps throughout her stay in the United States.

Those contacts, Assistant U.S. Attorney Erik Kenerson argued Wednesday, could assist in an effort to move Butina out of the country and out of reach of U.S. law enforcement.

""The Russian Federation has the ability to remove or exfiltrate its citizens from foreign countries,"" prosecutors argued. ""And due to international law and treaty restrictions, law enforcement would be prevented from stopping Butina from entering the Russian embassy... Simply put, neither the court nor law enforcement could stop her or has any recourse or remedy, in the event Butina decided to seek safe harbor in a diplomatic facility.""

The case against Butina is not related to Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election.

But Monday's charging announcement came on the same day that a summit in Helsinki between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin put a spotlight on accusations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. After meeting with Putin, Trump accepted Putin's denials that Russia had interfered in the U.S. election. Although Trump sought to clarify his remarks Tuesday, the president's conduct continues to draw outrage from both Republican and Democrat lawmakers.

In the Butina case, the FBI investigation revealed that the graduate student was working in the United States at the direction of an unnamed Russian government official, adding that both operatives sought to establish ""back channel lines of communications.""

""These lines could be used by the Russian Federation to penetrate the U.S. national decision making apparatus to advance the agenda of the Russian Federation,"" investigators said.

Before Monday's action by federal authorities, Butina's activities in the United States â€“ along with those of Alexander Torshin, a Russian politician and a top official of Russia's central bank â€“ have been the subject of several media reports about their attempts to cultivate political influence in the U.S.

Torshin was not named in the court documents made public Monday, but the ""Russian official"" described as Butina's co-conspirator matches Torshin's public profile as a former member of the Russian legislature who later became a top official at the Russian bank.

Prosecutors referred to numerous messages exchanged between the two in which the Russian official once compared Butina to the former Russian sleeper agent Anna Chapman, who in 2010 was part of an extraordinary spy swap between Russia and the U.S.

Chapman was among 10 Russian agents who had embedded themselves in the U.S., before their discovery by U.S. authorities.

""Are your admirers asking for your autograph,"" the Russian official wrote in 2017 after Butina's exploits in the U.S. were highlighted in news accounts.

""You have upstaged Anna Chapman.""

A March report issued by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee referred to the public reporting about Butina and Torshin, claiming that Butina ""sought to facilitate meetings with Trump campaign officials and between President Putin and candidate Trump during the election.""

""Ms. Butina, who appears to have been active with the NRA in recent years within the U.S., reportedly has founded a Russian counterpart gun advocacy organization,"" the congressional report stated. ""She may be able to clarify for the committee the origin and purpose of alleged Russian-directed efforts to approach U.S. organizations and persons connected to the Trump campaign throughout and prior to 2016. (The Democrat) minority believes that it is important to request as a matter of record Ms. Butinaâ€™s cooperation even if she is not a U.S. citizen ...""

Butina's attorney, Driscoll, has denied the government's claim of her work as an agent of the Russian government. Since her home was searched by the FBI in April, Driscoll said Butina has ""repeatedly"" offered to cooperate with federal investigators.

Separately, Driscoll said Butina has testified privately before the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.

""The substance of the charge ... is overblown,"" Driscoll said. ""While styled as some sort of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agent Registration Act, in actuality it describes a conspiracy to have a 'friendship dinner' at (restaurant) Bistro Bis with a group of Americans and Russians to discuss foreign relations between the two countries â€“ hardly a shocking development for (a) Russian international relations student living in Washington.""

3XEIP58NL15RXSTJH1PD4L8QJ7WZLJ,Democratic Candidates Say It's Time Their Party Actually Did Something About Guns,"At a gun safety town hall on Tuesday night in Aurora, Colorado, where a 2012 shooting in a theater left 12 people dead and dozens other injured, Democrats made clear that members of their party need to embrace real gun control reforms or step aside.

The crowd cheered when Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton and Jason Crow, the Democrat running against Republican Rep. Mike Coffman to represent Aurora in Congress, said that if congressional leadership is unwilling to pass gun control measures, they need to be replaced.

""One of the things we don't like to talk about is that when Democrats were last in charge, we didn't pass any of these measures either. And so I think it's time for a new generation of leadership across the Congress,"" Moulton, who is often a Democratic leadership critic, said to applause from the room.

His comments came in response to a question from a woman asking Moulton whether he saw signs of Republicans being willing to work with Democrats on gun legislation. He answered affirmatively, pointing to bipartisan support for bump stock bans. (The Las Vegas gunman used bump stocks to kill 58 people at an outdoor concert last year).

""Folks at the federal level have lacked any political will to actually do something about [gun safety],"" Joe Neguse, who is running for Congress in Colorado, told BuzzFeed News. ""The good news is I think that's about to change. Because I think we're going to change the folks that we send to Washington.""

Neguse is running to replace Rep. Jared Polis, a Democrat who is now running for governor of Colorado. Asked how big of a role he thought gun safety would play in the midterms, Neguse said, ""a huge role because it is a huge issue.""

""It will play, I think, a defining role in the general election in 2018. Because, I can speak with respect to folks that I meet on the campaign trail in the district that I'm seeking to represent, people are deeply concerned about it. ... At the end of the day, I think people are clamoring for change. And they want policymakers to finally take this issue seriously.""

Dozens of people turned out for the event focused on gun violence, many of them women wearing red Moms Demand Action shirts, after countless shootings in the United States and repeated failures by Congress to take up gun-control legislation. But there is a sense that 2018 could be different, following nationwide demonstrations that have shown the electorate is hungry for change.

But the issue is particularly personal in a state that has been rocked by gun violence, from the Aurora shooting to the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Littleton, Colorado that left 13 people dead.

The answers from the panelists, which included Moulton, Crow, and local candidates and activists, were filled with haunting firsthand experiences. There was Tom Sullivan, the man running for a Colorado state House seat whose son, Alex, died at the Aurora theater shooting.

Then there was Jane Dougherty, an activist whose sister was a psychologist at Sandy Hook Elementary School and died in the 2012 shooting. (She called the idea of arming teachers with guns, a proposal that has been floated by President Donald Trump and other Republicans, ""a Hollywood fantasy."")

The former president of Never Again-Colorado, Tay Anderson, spoke of the importance of including communities of color and young people in the conversation on gun legislation. ""It hurts the movement when you leave out a crucial part of the movement,"" Anderson said, while wearing a Black Lives Matter shirt.

More than an hour into the event, people were still lined up to ask questions when the panelists moved to end the event.

""We have commonsense proposals here. This isn't for lack of ideas. We have great ideas, we have great policy proposals. We just lack the will, and we lack the votes, to make them happen, and the courage to make it happen, right, and that goes back to the votes. So if the people who are in leadership now don't have the courage, then you just kick them out. That's the bottom line,"" Crow said, also to applause.

One woman who attended the town hall said that how candidates approach gun legislation is a major issue to her as a voter.

""I think it needs to be more at the forefront of their talking points and that sort of thing when they're running for office,"" Hope Francis, a resident of Thornton, Colorado, told BuzzFeed News. She added she was excited about Crow as a candidate, who is emphasizing it in his platform. ""That really stands out to me that that's what he's running on.""

As he closed the event, Crow looked at his phone to a countdown to the midterm elections. ""We have 90 days, 22 hours and 58 minutes before the polls close on this election,"" he said. ""And in that time either we're going to have a new set of leadership who's willing to take action ... and we're going to make change and we're going to save thousands of lives every year in this country, or we're not.""",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lissandravilla/democratic-candidates-say-its-time-their-party-actually-did,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic']","['5', '5', '4', '5', '4']"

Local reporters have been sharing the footage on social media after it was originally posted by an Instagram user. The clip appears to have been shot from a balcony near the Mezes restaurant in the city's Greektown area, where the attack reportedly took place.

""Super raw &amp; clear Video of #Toronto #Danforth shooter via @arilanise,"" wrote Twitter user @stilex, a Toronto photographer.

The footage shows the suspected gunman walking hurriedly toward the restaurant and opening fire with a handgun. Witnesses told CTV News that it sounded like the weapon was being reloaded repeatedly.

The latest shooting happened Sunday in Jacksonville at a video game tournament. At least two people were killed, according to authorities, and several were injured.

Some gun control advocates used the hashtags #AnotherFLShooting and #GunshineState -- to convey their frustration and call for gun control in the state that has come to the forefront in the national debate over the issue.

Some criticized the state's politicians and gun laws.

After a fierce debate over gun laws after the Parkland shooting this year, Florida lawmakers passed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, which includes banning the sale or possession of bump fire stocks, giving law enforcement greater power to seize weapons and ammunition from those deemed mentally unfit, and raising the age to purchase a firearm to 21 from 18. It also brought a three-day waiting period for firearm purchases, with some exceptions.

The suspect, David Katz, 24, used a handgun in the Sunday shooting, said Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams. He didn't say how or where Katz acquired the weapon.

The suspect took his own life, the sheriff said.

Katz, who is from Baltimore, Maryland, was in Jacksonville for a video football competition. The FBI, ATF and Baltimore Police were searching the suspect's South Baltimore home on Sunday.

During the Jacksonville shooting, nine people suffered gunshot wounds and two people were injured while fleeing the area, Williams said.

Dana Loesch, a NRA spokeswoman tweeted that shooting was a ""horrible tragedy"" and she blamed gun-free zones. ""End gun free zones or have the security in place to keep people safe in them,"" her tweet said.

Police in Fredericton, a city of about 56,000 that is the capital of the province of New Brunswick, said in a post on Twitter that the incident was under investigation and there were multiple fatalities.

Another police tweet said two of the four people killed were police officers but gave no details and did not release the names of the victims. The suspect is being treated for serious injuries.

Local media images showed emergency vehicles converging on a tree-lined residential street. Nearby facilities were closed and authorities told residents to stay locked in their homes.

Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) were assisting Fredericton authorities.

New Brunswick had only three homicide shootings in 2016, according to Statistics Canada.

Gun laws in Canada are more strict than in the United States but a proliferation of weapons has led to an increase in gun crimes in recent years.

""Awful news coming out of Fredericton,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Twitter. ""My heart goes out to everyone affected by this morning's shooting. We're following the situation closely.""

Three RCMP officers were killed and two more were wounded in 2014 in Moncton, New Brunswick, about 195 km (121 miles) from Fredericton, in one of the worst incidents of its kind in Canada.

Last month, a gunman walked down a busy Toronto street, killing two people and wounding 13 others before turning his weapon on himself.

3QXFBUZ4ZLYUP1L80NTPA1O3LWHGU3,"12 Insane Reasons the Left Opposes Brett Kavanaugh (Yes, These Are Real)","Democrats and the establishment media have been doing the hard and patriotic work of vetting Brett Kavanaugh, President Trumpâ€™s nominee to replace Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. And boy, are they desperate to come up with something thatâ€™ll stick.

Here are twelve of the biggest MEGA-SCANDAL bombshells so far uncovered that almost certainly disqualify him from sitting on the nationâ€™s highest court.

During a Tuesday appearance on PBSâ€™s NewsHour, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) stunned the world when she informed host Judy Woodruff that, as a Supreme Court Justice, Kavanaugh could affect the outcome of decisions made on the Supreme Court:

WOODRUFF: As you know, the president is calling Judge Kavanaugh one of the most qualified people ever to be nominated to the Supreme Court. Your view? HARRIS: Well, listen, I would categorize this nomination differently, which is that this is one of the most important positions on the United States Supreme Court, because, of course, replacing Kennedy is about the swing vote on the United States Supreme Court.

It is outrageous Trump could not find someone to nominate whose vote will not count.

It does not get any more prestigious than the Yale Law community, and when over 200 students, faculty, and alumni gather together to tell us Kavanaugh will start killing people on the Court, we need to pay attention.

â€œPeople will die if he is confirmed,â€ their open letter reads, and it is time for those opposed to people dying to get together and stop the killing of people.

Because if we do not, people will die.

If you do not find Yalelies compelling, I dare you to deny the wisdom of former members of Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign, those who have formed the group Demand Justice, and have broken the news that Brett Kavanaugh is a white guy.

â€œTrumpâ€™s judges are overwhelmingly white men,â€ they wrote on their website.

Demand Justice was founded by Brian Fallon, Hillaryâ€™s former campaign spokesman, who is himself a white male; so if we are not supposed to take white males seriously, this creates a bit of a dilemma because we have a white male wanting to be taken seriously when telling us not to take another white male seriously, so if we are not supposed to take a white male can someone please help me because my brain just locked up.

White male Stephen Colbert dug up the fact that â€œBrett Kavanaughâ€ sounds like â€œa waiter at Ruby Tuesdayâ€™s.â€

At first glance, that sounds like a ridiculous reason not to confirm a Supreme Court Justice, but hear Colbert out:

I donâ€™t know much about Kavanaugh but Iâ€™m skeptical because his name is Brett. That sounds less like a Supreme Court justice and more like a waiter at a Ruby Tuesday. â€œHey everybody, Iâ€™m Brett, Iâ€™ll be your Supreme Court justice tonight. Before you sit down, let me just clear away these rights for you.â€

And the fact that one-percenter Colbert has probably not seen the inside of a Ruby Tuesdayâ€™s since Friends was on the air should not color our admiration of his penetrating insight.

NBC Newsâ€™ Katy Tur, who has a real nose for these things, informed us of this shocking reveal Wednesday:

Do you think itâ€™s appropriate to continue to take such a strict originalist view of the Constitution given itâ€™s 2018 and not 1776? â€¦ The arc of history has shown that opinions have become more progressiveâ€¦ Americans are more progressive. Look at the polling. Most Americans support Roe v. Wade, gun control. They are split whether states should be able to restrict firearm ownership. But when it comes to money and politics, a majority want the next Justice to support limits on campaign spending by corporations and unions that goes against the Citizens United position.

Tur nosed around and discovered the year is not 1776; and thanks to her keen sense of smell when it comes to sniffing out a big story, everyone now nose knows this, which is why Tur always beaks breaks the big stories.

Yep, those first and second amendments are long past their stale date, and it is time we had a Supreme Court that understands this.

Fact Check: Ms. Tur is off on her facts, but just by a nose. The Constitution was not written in 1776; that was the Declaration of Independence. The Constitution and Bill of Rights were adopted in 1789 and 1791, respectively.

The essential Washington Post reports that Brett Kavanaugh not only likes baseball, he likes it so much he bought season tickets with his credit card. But this is just the beginningâ€¦

Sources inform me, the Washington Post is very close to nailing down stories that will reveal Kavanaughâ€™s similar affection for apple pie, his mother, the American flag, hot dogs, the Baby Jesus, and that poster of Raquel Welch in a fur bikini.

The essential Washington Post broke the news Wednesday that, in 2016, Brett Kavanaugh was in debt to the tune of $60,000 to $200,000.

Apparently, Kavanaugh went into debt to purchase season baseball tickets (see #6) for himself and for his friends.

The essential Washington Post reports that in 2017, Brett Kavanaughâ€™s â€œcredit card debts and loan were either paid off or fell below the reporting requirements.â€ Apparently, this happened after his friends reimbursed him for the season baseball tickets he purchased on their behalf (see #6 and #7).

In other wordsâ€¦ Brett Kavanaugh purchased season baseball tickets for his friendsâ€¦ who later reimbursed him.

Un-be-leeeev-a-bull.

The irreplaceable Washington Post once again brings democracy to darkness, or darkness to democracy, or light to the darkness of democracy, or darkness to my brain locked up again.

â€œIn Kavanaughâ€™s Georgetown Prep yearbook,â€ the darkness lighters at WaPo report, â€œhe listed himself as the treasurer of the Keg City Club â€” 100 Kegs or Bust and included references to the Beach Week Ralph Club and Rehoboth Police Fan Club.

In other words, Donald Trump nominated a man for the Supreme Court who enjoys baseball, beer, the beach, and police officers.

The indispensable New York Times reports that of the 48 law clerks Kavanaugh hired over the years, 25 were women, and they are now vouching for his integrity and professionalism.

This is [checks notes] a bad thing. Iâ€™m shocked that this is actually allowed to happen in the era of #MeToo.

The essential HuffPo reports that Brett Kavanaugh is â€œan attentive father to two young daughters and a man who has actually hired women more than a few times to work with him,â€ but correctly points out that â€œthis, of course, is almost totally irrelevant when it comes to whether he would make a good Supreme Court justice.â€

And that is exactly right, because we all know that if Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible father who never hired women, HuffPo would find that just as irrelevant.

Remember, character no longer counts, unless we are talking about Trump, then character counts even though it didnâ€™t for Bill Clinton but does not again with Kavanaugh because brain lock.

While the media have made it okay to call Ivanka Trump a â€œfeckless cunt,â€ President Trump a â€œcockholster,â€ and to boo a rape victim, the word â€œbitchâ€ has not yet been cleared by our media ministers.

Calling Hillary Clinton a â€œbitchâ€ (according to a single source, her bottom bitch David Brock) is obviously a disqualifier to sit on the Supreme Court â€” which means that seat will never be filled.

33K3E8REWXD7DQ9LMUSO2V69R7ZX8Y,Some Genius Is Driving Around Texas in a Truck With an Anti-Ted Cruz Trump Tweet Stamped to the Side,"In Texas, Republican Senator Ted Cruz has found himself in an unexpected dogfight with challenger Beto O'Rourke. After Cruz spent months ahead in the polls, O'Rourke is knocking on his front door, with a recent poll showing him behind by only one point. The Republican incumbent is doing all sorts of things to try to beat back the youngster, including getting President Donald Trump to rally for him and sharing a deceptively edited clip of O'Rourke's speech.

While Cruz is stuffing his pockets with big bucks -- he takes more money from the National Rifle Association than any other member of congress -- O'Rourke is relying on more grassroots efforts, like the video of him skateboarding in a parking lot that went viral last month. The latest stunt an O'Rourke ally has pulled is a plastered tweet from Trump that criticizes Cruz on the side of a truck that is being driven around Texas.

The truck was reportedly scheduled to hit the road on Thursday, but there have already been a handful of tweets from people who have spotted it on the highways of the Lone Star state.

The truck is the latest bit of guerrilla marketing from Mad Dog PAC, a Democratic organization known for some rather obscure marketing schemes. They made headlines last month when they hung ""SURRENDER DONALD"" on a bridge outside of Washington.

The tweet that's plastered across the side of the truck dates back to February 28, 2016, during the heat of the primary season when Cruz seemed to be the only thing standing between Trump and the Republican presidential nomination. Trump has softened his rhetoric on Cruz and announced in the end of August that he will be visiting Texas to stump for Cruz in ""the biggest stadium ... we can find.""

As for O'Rourke, he's been hitting the road constantly and slowly pulling the polls in his direction. It would still be a major upset if he is able to unseat Cruz, who is running for his second term, but that looks like a stunning possibility. Texans haven't elected a Democrat to the Senate in 30 years -- since Lloyd Bentsen in 1988. In 2012, Cruz defeated Democrat Paul Sadler by 16 points, getting nearly 1.3 million more votes. But there's a chance that the 2018 blue wave could crash on Texas, and if it does, Cruz will be out of a job.",https://ijr.com/2018/09/1123119-texas-trump-tweet-truck-beto-ted-cruz/,"['Republican', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Republican', 'Democratic', 'Democratic']","['1', '1', '1', '4', '3']"

On January 10, 2018, the Los Angeles Times reported Rep. Darrell Issaâ€™s (R-CA-49) announcement that he would not seek a 10th term, thereby opening the seat for other candidates this November. Those candidates are Diane Harkey (R) and Mike Levin (D). Harkey would continue Issaâ€™s pro-Second Amendment stance while Levin would seek further restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms.

The San Clemente Times reports that Gabby Giffords spoke in support of Levin at small event on July 17. She urged fellow gun control proponents to continue pressing for gun laws, saying, â€œWe must never stop fighting. Be bold, be courageous; the nation is counting on you.â€

Giffords became a vocal gun control proponent after being wounded by a gunman on January 8, 2011. And following the December 14, 2012, attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School she and her husband, Mark Kelly, began a high profile campaign for background checks.

Giffordsâ€™ attacker passed a background check for the gun he used against her on January 8, 2011.

If people do not think we are in deep trouble, then listen again, just to refresh your memory and outrage. Media keeps saying, Putin has something on Trump.

I think it is deeper than that. What did McCarthy know and when did he know it?

People have forgotten this, I fear. NO JOKE...McCarthy knew as did Paul Ryan.

There are more players in this takeover than Trump and the coverup runs deep.

Kos himself called them Traitors. It is time for the people of each state to call out these legislators and find out why THEY are being blackmailed or why is Russia paying them.

Time for the media to direct questions at these folks ! Why did this not cause a larger outrage? A dictator paying 45? This to me is damning and yes I know old news but all 45 had to do was create an ongoing chaos. These people are taking OUR money. They are raping our institutions and they are doing it on our dime. They know. They know Russia is taking over and all we do is wait for the next chaos. Keep in mind, McCarthy is House Majority Leader. I surely hope Muller is looking into the people serving in the legislature.

Oh, there is a deep state but it is a Deep State of Treason from within the GOP.

Trump is a tool. A very useful idiot. The power of the takeover is coming from these traitors. Trump could do little without the aid and comfort of these traitors.

A federal judge on Monday blocked blueprints for 3D-printed guns from being posted on the internet, ruling in favor of 19 states seeking to block their release.

United States District Judge Robert Lasnik of Seattle issued a preliminary injunction against President Donald Trump's administration, preventing it from executing a portion of a settlement agreement that would allow Texas-based nonprofit Defense Distributed to post the files online.

The ruling marked a win for the states that argued allowing the files to be posted could cause irreparable harm to their citizens.

In his ruling, Lasnik pointed to a number of substantive and procedural issues, arguing that a 3D-printed firearm can have a ""toy-like appearance"" and no identifying information, making it untraceable for investigators examining a crime.

He agreed with the states that argued the guns could cause their citizens harm.

""Guns that have no identifying information, guns that are undetectable, and guns that thwart the use of standard forensic techniques to link a particular projectile to a particular weapon will hamper law enforcement efforts to prevent and/or investigate crime within the Statesâ€™ respective jurisdictions,"" Lasnik wrote.

The U.S. Department of State, the lead defendant in the lawsuit, referred comment to the Department of Justice, which could not immediately be reached for comment.

The blueprints at issue are computer-aided design files that can be loaded into a 3D printer to manufacture a workable, plastic firearm.

Defense Distributed entered into a settlement agreement with the State Department earlier this year after years of litigation, allowing the nonprofit to post the files online beginning Aug. 1.

But the states, led by the state of Washington, sued to block it, arguing that it violated the federal Administrative Procedure Act and the 10th Amendment, which lays out states' rights.

The states successfully won a restraining order last month temporarily blocking the blueprints' release, with Monday's preliminary injunction ensuring the prohibition will remain in place as the case moves ahead.

In a statement, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood hailed the injunction as a victory.

""As the court pointed out, we filed suit because of the legitimate fear that adding these undetectable and untraceable guns to the arsenal of available weaponry will only increase the threat of gun violence against our communities,"" Underwood said in a statement.

3PUV2Q8SV5MCHI2BY6BMZQTIJMWBDF,"Who is Maria Butina, the gun activist and student charged with spying for Russia?","To some she was the flame-haired Russian face of their country's gun lobby. To others she was a journalist. Some saw her as a mere student.

But to the US government, she was a suspected spy.

Now Maria Butina, 29, is facing federal conspiracy charges, appearing in court on Wednesday in Washington DC.

Butina's lawyers acknowledge that she has been intensively questioned by the Senate intelligence committee, but insist that she is just a student.

Yet she has been on the FBI's radar since at least 2015.

Born in Barnaul, in Siberia, to an engineer mother and entrepreneur father, she was interested in politics from an early age and studied political science at Altu State University.

Her father and grandfather were hunters, she said in a 2016 interview, and she founded a group called The Right to Bear Arms in 2012 to promote liberalisation of gun ownership laws in Russia.

Initially on graduating she followed in her businessman father's footsteps, launching and running a furniture store in Siberia.

But in 2011 she sold the store to move to Moscow to pursue a career in politics, and maintain her gun rights activism.

She took up an unpaid role as a special assistant to a well-connected Russian senator, Aleksandr Torshin, and worked for him from 2011 to 2015 while he was serving on the Russian federal council as first vice chairman. He shared her passion for guns, being declared a life member of the NRA and travelling to the US for conferences - until he was stopped by sanctions in April of this year.

By 2015 she was frequently in the US, and attended a Trump rally in Las Vegas a month after his candidacy was declared and asked him about his views on Vladimir Putin.

""I know Putin, and I'll tell you what, we get along with Putin. I believe I would get along very nicely with Putin, OK? I don't think you'd need the sanctions. I think we would get along very, very well,"" Mr Trump said.

She also briefly met Donald Trump Jr.

The following year she was studying for a masters in international relations at the American University's Kogod School of Business, but her gun activism in Russia remained strong.

""We and gun rights advocates in many other countries have learned important lessons from the American NRA,"" Butina said at the time. ""The power of average citizens steadily seeking ever greater gun rights through the power of persuasion and smart communication.""

In February 2016, Butina set up a company in South Dakota with Republican veteran strategist Paul Erickson, with whom, according to the Washington Post, she was in a romantic relationship.

In November, after the election, she held a fancy dress party in Washington DC attended by Mr Erickson and Trump campaign aides - reportedly bragging about being part of the Trump campaign's communications with Russia.

She then attended Mr Trump's inauguration, the Washington Post reported, with Mr Erickson by her side.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/maria-butina-gun-activist-student-210340174.html,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Republican', 'Neutral']","['2', '4', '5', '2', '2']"
3NSM4HLQNSCTAX85MAEWUEVGO1MQQB,The GOP is hitting Democrats for wanting to abolish ICE. Here's how to hit back.,"Democrats who find themselves needing to push back against this type scurrilous attackâ€”in other words, just about every Democrat this yearâ€”would do well to follow the example of Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. In his bid for governor last year, Northam faced a barrage of racist Republican attack ads arguing that his election would lead to more gang violence by MS-13 (a group that has also become one of Trump's favorite boogymen), and that he was generally weak on crime. In the final weeks of the contest, Republican Ed Gillespie even took Northam's support for restoring voting rights to felons who had served their sentences and twisted it to claim Northam wanted to ""restor[e] the rights of unrepentant sex offenders,"" which of course made it sound like he wanted to restore their right to engage in sex crimes.

Northam responded to the GOP's attempts to portray him as a pro-crime monster with a spot of his own where the narrator quickly dismissed Gillespie's many attacks as ""false"" and ""absurd"" and switched gears to remind viewers that Northam attended the prestigious Virginia Military Institute ""and was an Army doctor for eight years,"" then went on to help pass ""mandatory life sentences for violent sexual predators."" Northam himself appeared in the final segment direct to camera, noting that he's a pediatrician and saying, ""For Ed Gillespie to say I would tolerate anyone hurting a child is despicable."" Northam ended up winning the election a few weeks later by a strong 54-45 margin.

While every state and candidate will be different, Northam's ad is a good guide for Democrats looking to respond to the type of attacks the RGA just launched in Arizona and that Republicans will certainly deploy around the nation. To begin with, Northam's campaign importantly did not repeat the GOP's charges against him, which would have immediately put him on the defensive and given those false allegations more exposure as he tried to refute them. Instead, the ad pushed back by reminding viewers about Northam's biography and work, with the candidate himself forcefully declaring that the idea he would tolerate anyone hurting a child ""despicable.""

Democrats will want to study this strategy so they can flip the script when Trump and his allies try to paint their disgust with the administration's family detention policies as dangerous.

2Q Fundraising

â— Fundraising: Daily Kos Elections is once again pleased to bring you our quarterly House fundraising roundup chart, with data on every major race for the second quarter of 2018. In total, we cover 423 candidates in 169 different contests. That's shrunk from our first-quarter coverage, but that's because many states have held primaries over the last few months, narrowing down the playing field.

What's not down are the fundraising numbers themselvesâ€”at least for Democrats. For candidates seeking GOP-held seats, the hauls are like nothing we've ever seen in the many years weâ€™ve been doing this. An astounding 18 such challengers raised more than $1 million in the second quarter, an almost unheard-of sum for a House race, and twice as many more brought in over $500,000. Money, it hardly need be said, is not everything in elections. But the totals across the board, including races almost no one would have predicted would be contested a year ago, are so enormous that they represent an unmistakable sign of progressive enthusiasm. Check them all out here for yourself.

P.S. You can also find our Senate fundraising chart here. Because Senate campaigns still file their reports on paper (hard to believe but true), full data isn't available yet, but we'll keep updating the numbers as they come in.

â— CA-Sen: Dianne Feinstein (D-inc): $1.1 million raised, additional $4.75 million self-funded, $3.76 million cash-on-hand

â— MI-Sen: Sandy Pensler (R): $104,000 raised, $2.28 million cash-on-hand

â— MN-Sen-B: Tina Smith (D-inc): $2.5 million raised, $1.8 million cash-on-hand

â— TX-Sen: Ted Cruz (R-inc): $4.1 million raised, $9.3 million cash-on-hand (previous announcement included money from joint fundraising committee and leadership PAC)

Senate

â— AZ-Sen: We now have a copy of the new TV ad that KelliPAC, which recently received a $500,000 donation from billionaire megadonor Robert Mercer, is airing as part of a recently reported $447,000 buy to support former state Sen. Kelli Ward in the GOP primary. The ad tries to cram in as many words as it can into 30 seconds, blasting Rep. Martha McSally as ""one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress"" and claiming she favors ""big spending, special interests, and amnesty."" The narrator accuses her of opposing Trump's border wall.

Meanwhile, hard-right Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar has rebuked his House colleague and endorsed Ward.

â— MO-Sen: Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill's latest ad is a minute-long spot that highlights her fight against big pharmaceutical companies that hurt Americans by jacking up prices on critical prescription drugs and contributing to the opioid epidemic.

â— MT-Sen: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's newest TV ad highlights his background as a lifelong farmer and touts his work to pass a farm bill that helps protect the interests of Montana farmers.

â— NV-Sen: Clean Air Moms Action, which is affiliated with the Environmental Defense Fund, has announced a $500,000 TV buy against GOP Sen. Dean Heller, with slightly different spots airing in the Las Vegas and Reno media markets.

The Las Vegas commercial begins with a news anchor saying how the city has worse air quality than Los Angeles, while the Reno version has a narrator describing how Nevada has some of the worst pollution in America. Both ads then say the bad air puts families at risk, but polluters are propping up Heller. They go on to accuse him of taking their money and backing their agenda, including ""voting to eliminate limits on air pollution causing smog.""

â— OH-Sen, OH-Gov: TRZ Communication, a firm weâ€™ve never heard of before, has polled Ohio's major statewide races on behalf of the tea party-aligned We the People Convention, but it comes with a major caveat that warrants skepticism of its results. Before getting to the horse race, the pollster asked:

""This fall, Democrats are attempting to take back majority control of the U.S. House of Representatives on the pledge to repeal the tax cuts, to fight to keep U.S. borders open and bring in millions of more immigrants, to restore Obamacare, and to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump. Do you support this Democratic plan?""

That line of right-wing messaging can only help prime respondents in a way they won't be when they fill out their ballots for November, and it's a great example of how it's a bad idea to ask such leading questions before testing candidate matchups.

That being said, the results still aren't even bad for Democrats, given this priming and the partisan affiliation of the source. They find Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown up by 45-41 against GOP Rep. Jim Renacci, but Republican Mike DeWine leads by 42-38 over Democrat Richard Cordray in the governor's race. Every other poll for months has shown Brown with a much firmer lead, and it's telling that even after priming respondents, DeWine only musters a 4-point edge in a race multiple independent pollsters have found to be up for grabs.

â— TN-Sen: On behalf of the Committee to Defend the President, WPA Intelligence is out with a survey that gives Republican Marsha Blackburn a small 38-35 lead over Democrat Phil Bredesen. The survey came days after a Democratic group dropped a PPP survey that had Bredesen up 44-41. Interestingly, WPA released a poll in February for this organization that gave Blackburn a stronger 44-39 lead, and that five-month-old survey curiously had fewer undecided voters than this new one does.

â— WI-Sen: The NRA has endorsed state Sen. Leah Vukmir in the Aug. 14 GOP primary to take on Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.

â— Senate: Politico reports that the DSCC has reserved a combined $30 million in TV time in six states: Arizona, Indiana, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, and West Virginia. They did not reveal how much cash was being allocated to each race.

Gubernatorial

â— FL-Gov: Bad news continues to mount for GOP state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam as new details emerge over how his office failed to properly handle background checks and permits for firearms and concealed weapons. The Tampa Bay Times now reports that Putnam settled a lawsuit in 2016 brought by former licensing supervisor Xenia Bailey, who alleged ""gross misconduct"" in how gun permit applications were handled and that the departmentâ€™s high approval quotas ""guaranteed abuse."" The Department of Agriculture didn't admit any wrongdoing in the settlement, but it did pay $30,000 to Bailey, who claimed she was retaliated against for whistleblowing.

In her suit, Bailey said she warned her supervisor of ""many operational deficiencies including the improper issuing of gun licenses to convicted felons that had been going on for years in the division."" Rather than evince concern, Bailey alleged that her boss told her ""that she worked for the NRA"" and demanded the department process 75 applications a day for concealed weapons permits. When Bailey cut the quota down to 60, her superiors reversed her.

Last month, the Times broke the story of Putnamâ€™s office failing to conduct full background checks on certain applications for concealed weapons permits for more than a year because an employee couldn't log into an FBI database used to review such applications. That breakdown led to at least 291 people getting wrongly approved.

Putnam has been an avid supporter of loosening gun-safety restrictions, and the self-proclaimed â€œproud NRA selloutâ€ has boasted about how much easier he has made it to acquire a concealed weapons permit. If these latest allegations are true, however, that label could more accurately describe how his department actually sold out to the NRA by recklessly approving too many weapons permits at the expense of public safety.

It's hard to say just how much damage this story has done to Putnam, however. Some recent polls have begun to find his early advantage withering against his GOP primary foe, Rep. Ron DeSantis, but those polls have come after DeSantis finally began airing television ads touting his endorsement from Trump, which probably is a lot more meaningful to Republican voters than Putnamâ€™s lackadaisical approach to his job duties. The latest such survey comes from GOP firm Fabrizio, Lee &amp; Associates, which polled on behalf of an ""unspecified political group that's not involved in the governor's race."" This is their first foray into this contest, and they give DeSantis a 42-30 edge.

Putnam seems to be feeling the heat, since he has begun to go negative on DeSantis. His latest TV ad features several seniors who claim Trump will supposedly stand up for Social Security and Medicare but say they oppose DeSantis for voting to cut both programs and raise the retirement age. However, as Democrats quickly noted, Putnam himself supported proposals that would have cut both programs when he served five terms in Congress a decade ago.

Meanwhile on the Democratic side, former state Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink has endorsed former Rep. Gwen Graham. Sink lost by a razor-thin margin as Team Blue's nominee in the 2010's and is the only Democrat to have won a statewide executive office in the last two decades.

â— GA-Gov: Secretary of State Brian Kemp is up with what the Atlanta Journal-Constitution describes as his closing ad ahead of next week's GOP primary runoff. Unlike in past spots, the candidate does not make anyone praise him at gunpoint, nor does he blow anything up or brag about his ""big truck, just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take 'em home myself."" Instead, as soft piano music plays in the background, Kemp pitches himself as a guy who ""believe[s] in God, family and country â€“ in that order.""

Kemp goes on to hit some conservative culture war touchstones as he adds that he says ""[m]erry Christmas and God bless you,"" backs Trump and ""ironclad borders,"" and stands for the National Anthem. Kemp continues by saying that ""If any of this offends you, then I'm not your guy,"" and ends by describing himself as a ""politically incorrect conservative who will end corrupt pay-to-play politics.""

â— KS-Gov: On Monday, the NRA endorsed Gov. Jeff Colyer in the Aug. 7 GOP primary.

â— MI-Gov: The GOP firm JMC Analytics, which does not have a client, takes a look at the Aug. 7 GOP primary and gives Attorney General Bill Schuette a 25-17 lead over Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, while state Sen. Patrick Colbeck takes 10. Every single poll we've seen of this contest has found Schutte ahead, but this is the smallest lead he's ever posted. The last survey we saw here was a late June Target-Insyght poll for MIRS News that gave Schutte a considerably stronger 45-16 lead, while Colbeck was at 8.

â— NY-Gov: New York's candidate filing deadline for state and local office passed late last week (a complete list of all filings is here), and campaigns were also obligated to submit reports detailing their fundraising for the first half of the year on Monday. There were no surprises in terms of candidacies in the major contests: Last-second entries are impossible thanks to the state's onerous petition requirements, and no one bailed unexpectedly. Petition challenges are always possible but are uncommon at the statewide level.

In the race for governor, incumbent Andrew Cuomo faces a one-on-one matchup in the Sept. 13 Democratic primary with actor and activist Cynthia Nixon, who is challenging Cuomo from the left over his years-long resistance to progressive reforms. Nixon's already had an impact, driving Cuomo to adopt more liberal stances on a whole range of issues, but the governor retains a wide lead in all public polling to date.

Cuomo maintains a gigantic financial advantage, too. During the first six months of 2018, he raised $6 million dollars and still sat on a $31 million stockpile after spending $5.3 million. Nixon brought in $1.6 million since entering the race in March and spent just under $1 million, leaving her with $660,000 in the bank. Nixon is hoping that grassroots enthusiasm on her side can make up the difference: She's received over 30,000 total donations, with 97 percent of contributions $200 or less. Cuomo, by contrast, had just 1,939 donations, with an average gift of $3,017.

In November, the winner is almost certain to square off against Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro, who's the heavy favorite to win the GOP nomination and has $887,000 in his campaign account after raising $1.1 million. Former Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner, a Democrat who had considered a primary bid against Cuomo herself, is running as an independent. She took in just $410,000 and has $163,000 remaining.

â— WI-Gov: Campaign finance reports are in for the first six months of 2018. GOP Gov. Scott Walker took in a hefty $5.5 million during this time and ended June with $5.9 million on-hand, far more than any of the Democrats competing in the Aug. 14 primary. The Democratic hauls are below:

State Schools Superintendent Tony Evers: $396,000 raised, additional $100,000 self-funded, $307,000 cash-on-hand Attorney Matt Flynn: $197,000 raised, additional $100,000 self-funded, $403,000 cash-on-hand Activist Mike McCabe: $96,000 raised, additional $60,000 self-funded, $68,000 cash-on-hand Firefighters union president Mahlon Mitchell: $524,000 raised, $368,000 cash-on-hand Former state Rep. Kelda Helen Roys: $422,000 raised, additional $255,000 self-funded, $668,000 cash-on-hand Madison Mayor Paul Soglin: $116,000 raised, $58,000 cash-on-hand State Sen. Kathleen Vinehout: $75,000 raised, additional $15,000 self-funded, $21,000 cash-on-hand

A bit surprisingly, Roys had by far the most cash in the bank at the end of June. A June Marquette poll found Evers far ahead of the rest of the field with 25 percent of the vote, while Roys barely registered with just 2. However, Roys will have the resources to get her name out in the next month.

â— WY-Gov: Attorney Harriet Hageman is out with what we believe is her first ad ahead of the Aug. 21 GOP primary. Hageman stands in the ranch she grew up in and pledges to ""push back against job killing regulations."" Hageman also brags that she's ""only candidate that has fought against the federal government and won."" It's an unremarkable spot aside from how Hageman goes from sentence to sentence without pausing at all.

House

â— CA-48: Monmouth ventures to this coastal Orange County seat for their latest House poll, and they give Democrat Harley Rouda a small edge against GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher under all of their three various models of the electorate. Using their ""potential voters"" model, Rouda leads 46-43; under the ""standard midterm"" it's 47-45; and the ""Democratic surge"" model has it at 48-44.

It's been clear for pretty much the entire cycle that Rohrabacher, who still gives Donald Trump a run for his money when it comes to sucking up to Vladimir Putin, is in for an expensive fight in a seat that swung from 55-43 Romney to 48-46 Clinton. However, both Rohrabacher and Rouda emerged from a very expensive and crowded June top-two primary, and Rouda only learned he'd made it to the general election in the final week of June. At the end of June, Rouda held a small $483,000 to $479,000 cash-on-hand edge over the incumbent.

However, Rouda did outraise Rohrabacher $770,000 to $282,000 during the quarter, so he could end up with a whole lot more cash soon enough.

â— OH-12: The GOP has begun their ritual of trashing their candidate just ahead of a House special election. This time, Troy Balderson is the guy who gets pre-spun as a weak candidate ahead of his Aug. 7 showdown with Democrat Danny O'Connor. The Washington Post's Dave Weigel writes that Balderson ""has underwhelmed his party's strategists and lagged in fundraising,"" and that Republicans privately gripe that O'Connor beat him â€œto the general election airwaves and built up his favorable numbers with ads about rejecting [Nancy] Pelosi and wanting to protect health-care coverage.""

That's actually pretty mild stuff compared to what some previous House special election nominees, even ones who ended up winning their races, had to endure. Most notably, Republicans bashed Florida Republican David Jolly's 2014 campaign as ""a Keystone Cops operation, marked by inept fundraising,"" and they faulted the 41-year-old recently-divorced candidate for campaigning with his girlfriend, who was 14 years younger than him.

Last year, we also heard Republicans complaining about Ron Estes in Kansas' 4th; Greg Gianforte in Montana (and this was before he assaulted a reporter); and Karen Handel in Georgia's 6th, though they weren't quite so mean to them as they were to Jolly. The guy who got it the worst was Pennsylvania's Rick Saccone before the special election in the 18th District that he actually did lose in March.

As we noted about Saccone, while the GOP did seem to have some very serious anger towards their candidate, Team Red seems to have settled into a pattern of lowering expectations ahead of closely watched races. If they win, they can just go back to crowing how Trump is awesome and how everything is going great, and if they lose, they can try to put all the blame on an extraordinarily awful candidate the way they ended up doing with Saccone. The only poll we've seen in weeks was an O'Connor poll that found Balderson ahead 48-43, so it seems quite likely that, private griping aside, the GOP is ahead here.

However, O'Connor is up with a new ad that takes aim at the GOP's tax bill, which Team Red once thought would give them a huge lift in November. The narrator frames the race as a choice between Oâ€™Connor and Balderson, who backs ""a corporate tax giveaway that racks up two trillion in debt, forcing massive tax hikes on our kids or deep cuts to Social Security and Medicare."" The spot also quotes the Republican declaring, ""I have no problems raising the retirement age."" The rest of the ad features footage of O'Connor pledging to stand against any attempts to cut Social Security and Medicare.

Other Races

â— NY-AG: The position of New York attorney general, which is one of the most powerful perches in the country for a progressive eager to take on the Trump administration, became open in a shocker when Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned in May, hours after he was accused of sexual assault by multiple women. The woman the legislature chose to replace him, Barbara Underwood, is not seeking a full term, and four notable Democrats have filed to run in the race to succeed her: New York City Public Advocate Tish James, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, law professor Zephyr Teachout, and Cuomo appointee Leecia Eve.

James, the favorite of the political establishment, is looking to make history as the first black woman to win statewide office in New York. Maloney, who'd be the Empire State's first gay statewide elected official, came into the race with a big advantage in money: He had $3 million stockpiled in his congressional account, which his lawyers say he can use for a state bid.

Teachout performed much better than expected in a primary challenge to Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2014 but then lost a race for Congress in 2016. Like Cynthia Nixon in the governor's race, she's banking on the excitement of rank-and-file progressives, but against heavyweight rivals like James and Maloney who will embrace rather than spurn progressives, it'll be harder for her to gain traction than it was against the reactionary Cuomo four years ago. Eve ran for lieutenant governor in 2006 but didn't make it to the primary. The Republican nominee will be attorney Keith Wofford.

P.S. Maloney says that if he loses the primary, he'll seek re-election to the House; if he wins, however, that would leave Democrats scrambling to find a replacement candidate with less than two months before Election Day in a potentially vulnerable suburban district that swung from Obama to Trump in 2016.",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2018/7/18/1781432/-Morning-Digest-The-GOP-is-hitting-Democrats-for-wanting-to-abolish-ICE-Here-s-how-to-hit-back,"['Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Republican', 'Strongly Republican']","['1', '5', '3', '3', '3']"

The shooting occurred at the GLHF Game Bar during a Madden 19 video game tournament and initial reports indicate 3 people were killed including the gunman and several others were wounded.

David Katz carried out his killing spree at the Jacksonville Landing complex Sunday armed with two handguns, both purchased legally in Maryland less than a month ago.

Katz, who killed two fellow gamers before taking his own life, had two guns on his person â€” a .45 and a 9mm pistol â€” when he opened fire, leaving 13 victims in his wake.

Police officials said Monday that Katz had extra ammunition with him, but there was no indication Katz had planned the shooting in advance.

Purchasing a firearm at a licensed dealer means Katz would have had to pass an FBI background check that would have reviewed his criminal history.

Under federal law, people are prohibited from purchasing firearms if they are convicted felons; have a history of illegal drug use; have been adjudicated as mentally ill or involuntarily committed for mental health treatment; are classified as fugitives; or have been convicted of domestic abuse.

Katz used only one of the two handguns during the shooting, and it was equipped with a legally purchased aftermarket laser sighting device, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said at a press conference.

The red dot associated with a laser pointer can be seen hovering over a gamer's chest during a live-stream video broadcast from the tournament, moments before the shooting started and the video feed went dead.

Officials said all of the injured are expected to fully recover from their injuries.

""As bad as this is, this could have been much worse,"" Williams said, adding that he did not have any comment on reports that a hospital had reported finding a hollow point bullet in one of the shooting victims.

Sunday's shooting stands in contrast to previous mass killings in Florida and elsewhere where gunmen used semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15 to deadly effect.

The high powered nature of those guns coupled with expanded magazine capacity contributed to high casualties at the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland last February and at Orlandoâ€™s Pulse Nightclub in 2016, where, respectively, 19 and 49 people lost their lives.

In the case of the high school massacre, shooter Nikolas Cruz, 19, legally bought his AR-15-style semi-automatic weapon â€” also called a long gun â€” about one year before committing the crime. Pulse nightclub shooter Omar Mateen also had legally purchased his weapons, a Sig Sauer long-gun and a 9mm Glock 17 pistol.

In March, Florida governor Rick Scott signed a new gun law, prompted by the high school shooting, which raises the minimum age of purchasing a firearm to 21 from 18. The National Rifle Association has opposed the measure, arguing that 18-year-olds are legally considered adults.

Katz would not have had any issues purchasing his firearms in Florida: He was 24.

According to police officials, Katz wordlessly walked past other patrons of the Chicago Pizza store until he reached a part of the restaurant where gamers were busy playing. Katz, a former football video-game champion, then opened fire with his handgun.

Police still have offered no motive for the shooting.

31JUPBOOROMCDWSW8BP0R1BMKPDL86,Is Nike An Ally Now?,"Last week, Nike released its 30th anniversary â€œJust Do Itâ€ campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick with the slogan, â€œBelieve in something, even if it means sacrificing everything,â€ and a video that touches on issues of ability and racial injustice, and gives media space to consider Kaepernickâ€™s work against police brutality.

There have been a variety of responses. Some conservative folks including President Donald Trump have decried or vowed to boycott Nike. Others have gone as far as to destroy their Nike gear (destroying stuff you already paid for will sure show â€™em). Many others have praised Nike, purchased more gear, resulting in a 31 percent increase in online sales since the campaignâ€™s release, and are elevating Nike as an ally or hero in the movement for black lives.

Some in more self-proclaimed progressive spaces are shaking their heads at the campaign, calling it nothing more than a corporation riding the wave of athlete activism and marketing to a younger and more diverse crowd to make more money.

Nike is a lot like many (white) liberals who historically show up late after the major violence and vitriol of a movement and claim to be allies.

My immediate question when the campaign launched was, â€œWhere was Nike four years ago?â€ Where was this multibillion-dollar corporation when black people were being tear-gassed as we resisted the very police brutality that Kaepernick later protested? What did it have to say about the value of black bodies outside of sports and the injustices in the United States before an NFL quarterback ever took a knee?

Where was Nike even two years ago when Kaepernick started his protests? Where was it when it was more dangerous or costly to associate with him while he was tied to the NFL?

Nike is a lot like many (white) liberals who historically show up late and after the major violence or vitriol of a movement. They expect praise or to be called â€œwokeâ€ after the primary risk is gone. They call themselves allies without paying real costs and are able to talk the talk and equate it with being down for a cause.

It is much easier to put a safety pin on your clothing or change your Facebook banner to an inclusive message rather than putting jobs, reputations and relationships on the line to interrupt systemic oppression. Much of modern â€œactivismâ€ is simply progressive projection with no cost. White liberals and Nike alike often show up when the danger has mostly passed and the risk is much lower.

Nike is late to the movement and still problematic in probably more ways than it is not, including its constant labor disputes and a history of using sweatshops to create its products. However, it has taken a step as a corporation that has been meaningful for people around the country. It showed up and put its logo on the cause of justice. Yes, it is commodifying justice in some ways, but it is also creating the context to normalize the movement against police brutality. Those are not mutually exclusive.

For progressives, it is easy to see this little bit of progress as no progress and to never be able to affirm the steps forward, all in the name of a mythological pure justice where people are birthed as automatic anti-racists. Yet, no one pops out of the womb actualized; people (and companies) grow and find their way.

This is a lesson for all allies: Show up soon, show up often.

If we never stop to engage with the small things worth celebrating, we will likely win fewer people over to the cause of justice. No, we shouldnâ€™t spend our energy coddling allies for finally doing the right thing. Rather, we should be able to recognize that progress matters, that people change, that your racist uncle is no longer using the phrase â€œmulattoâ€ or â€œcolored peopleâ€ and thatâ€™s a good thing. Doing something is certainly better than doing nothing.

Is it possible to see the imperfection of a situation and still recognize where some degree of progress is being made? It is easy to believe that no progress is ever good enough, that if people or corporations have complicity and oppression in their past, then no move forward counts; however, almost no movement has thrived by decrying progress.

So yes, Nike is problematic. It is leaning on capitalism, a primary tool of white supremacy, to show up for the movement in some way. It also uses cheap labor. It has gender discrimination suits against it. It jumped on the movement late and in a way that blatantly benefits it. Itâ€™s all true.

But at least it did something. Unlike other corporations that have worked with the Trump campaign or done business with the National Rifle Association, Nike centered the marginalized and our experiences. Nike made a statement. Nike did it.

Nike put a light-skinned, afro-wearing, controversial activist in the spotlight and gave him the capacity to continue his on-the-ground community development work. It created a day of celebration for black folks to feel seen and heard, if even in a small way, by having our issue at the center of a major campaign. It centered people of differing abilities and races in a campaign and touted Serena Williams, a woman, as the greatest athlete of time.

Now Nike has a responsibility to not just pay lip service to the movement, but to do what its campaign says, to sacrifice and to work hard against police brutality and violence against black bodies. Like all allies, talk is cheap and social media campaigns only go so far. It needs to follow its own slogan and just do it.

This is a lesson for all allies, show up soon, show up often, but if you happen to show up late, itâ€™s not about you being the hero, but about the heroes that came before you who paved the way for you to join at all.

3QX22DUVOPZUUQ6UGG1PJSAJVS4VMN,Russian spy offered sex for role in 'special interest' group: feds,"The Russian grad student accused of acting as a foreign spy in the US -- and trying to broker meetings between President Trump and Vladimir Putin -- offered sex in exchange for a position in a ""special interest organization,"" according to new court papers filed Wednesday.

Maria Butina, 29, who was charged Monday with acting as an unregistered agent of the Russian Federation, had a relationship with an unnamed 56-year-old American who granted her access to influential American political figures and a gun rights group, federal prosecutors allege.

But the feds say Butina was just using the guy -- identified in court papers as ""U.S. Person 1"" -- and tried to bed at least one other person for favors.

""On at least one occasion, Butina offered an individual other than U.S. Person 1 sex in exchange for a position within a special interest organization,"" the court papers read.

""Further, in papers seized by the FBI, Butina complained about living with U.S. Person 1 and expressed disdain for continuing to cohabitate with U.S. Person 1.""

The feds made the allegations in an application to keep Butina locked up ahead of her trial.

They argue that she has every reason to flee the country and no meaningful ties to the US -- because even the 56-year-old boyfriend appears to be ""simply a necessary aspect of her activities.""

The man isn't named in the papers, but the Washington Post notes that he matches the description of Paul Erickson, a South Dakota Republican operative who Butina previously told the Senate Intelligence Committee she'd had a relationship with.

Butina presented herself as a gun rights activist and began attending National Rifle Association meetings in 2014 -- gaining access to the group's elite gatherings through former Russian senator and lifetime NRA member Alexander Torshin, the paper reports.

Through her connections, she twice tried to arrange meetings between Trump and Putin of behalf of Torshin during the 2016 US presidential election, according to a New York Times report.",https://nypost.com/2018/07/18/russian-spy-offered-sex-for-role-in-special-interest-group-feds/,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Republican', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Republican']","['5', '3', '1', '2', '2']"

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo doesn't feel sorry for the National Rifle Association, despite the organization's claims that Cuomo has hurt the company financially by targeting companies that do business with the gun rights group, CNN reported.

The NRA is suing Cuomo and the state of New York because the state has moved to block the NRA from selling Carry Guard insurance. Carry Guard is liability insurance for people who are involved in shooting incidents.

""I believe the NRA represents an extremist group,"" Cuomo said on CNN. ""I believe they've been counterproductive for gun owners in this country. I believe their politics suits them to stop any common-sense gun reform. The NRA has always been against any progress whatsoever. They are oblivious to the facts. They've caused carnage in this nation.""

Cuomo has been accused of targeting and actively opposing the NRA, and he freely admits that is the case.

The governor referred to the NRA's Carry Guard as ""murder insurance"" and said he is working with other states to eliminate the availability of the program nationwide.

""[Carry Guard is] designed for people who carry weapons, and the insurance policy essentially insured them for intentional bad acts, intentional wrongdoing,"" Cuomo said on CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday. ""It would be highly unusual for a state to allow an insurance company to reimburse for an illegal activity. They call it 'murder insurance.'""

Cuomo insisted that his policies do not negatively impact responsible gun owners, saying ""the NRA hates that message because they are against any reasonable conclusion.""

The NRA's lawsuit against the state of New York accuses Cuomo and the Department of Financial Services of illegally coercing banks and insurance companies not to conduct business with the NRA.

According to the NRA, it has struggled to obtain insurance and funding, and unless something changes it will become ""unable to exist as a not-for-profit or pursue its advocacy mission.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/08/06/gov-cuomo-unsympathetic-toward-nra-woes-says-extremist-group-has-caused-carnage,"['Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Republican', 'Strongly Republican']","['5', '1', '4', '5', '5']"
3UXQ63NLAB4VFUQ3BN9AI31NSVYLB5,Students across U.S. protest on Columbine anniversary,"CLOSE More than 1 million people are expected to attend the March for Our Lives in Washington D.C. hoping for changes to gun regulations and school safety. Just the FAQs

Students gather at the University of Memphis for a walkout against gun violence on March 14, 2018. Students at thousands of schools nationwide plan to stage walkouts on April 20, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting. (Photo: Brad Vest, The Commercial Appeal, via USA T)

Students at thousands of schools across the nation are planning to stage walkouts Friday to mark the 19th year since the Columbine High School massacre, an attack that marked a new era of gun violence.

More than 2,300 events are planned for the National School Walkout, the latest mass protest organized by a student-led gun-control movement forged after a Valentine's Day shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead.

A Connecticut high school student started planning the walkouts the day of the Florida shooting. Lane Murdock, a sophomore at Ridgefield High School, says she hopes this walkout will rejuvenate the #NeverAgain movement and continue the dialogue about gun-control measures, including a ban on assault-styled weapons.

""Keeping up the momentum is important,"" Murdock said. ""We saw that low after March for Our Lives, but students aren't quitting on this. Our generation is demanding change and won't be ignored or swept under the rug.""

Murdock, whose school is about 15 miles from Newtown, Conn., where 27 were killed in a rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, said she decided to take a stand and plan the walkouts because of her immediate reaction to the shooting in Parkland at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

""I really felt quite numb to it. Our whole country is pretty desensitized to gun violence and once I realized I was, too, it really scared me,"" she said. ""I was no longer surprised that people were dying. That shouldn't be the case.""

There have been other protests since the Parkland shooting. More than a million people gathered for the March for Our Lives rallies in Washington and across the nation on March 24. On March 14, students staged the first nationwide walkout. And students talked gun control with lawmakers at town halls in recent weeks.

""I think a lot of people see this as the finale, but no, it's still just the beginning of this movement,"" Murdock said, adding that organizers have estimated more than 1 million students plan to participate Friday.

She said the biggest difference between the previous nationwide walkout is that hers encourages students to continue protesting all day, instead of the 17-minute rallies many schools held.

The walkouts are scheduled to start at 10 a.m., and students will take 13 seconds to honor the 13 killed at Columbine High School in 1999. After that, it's up to students what they decide to do next: There will be open mics and early voter registrations.

Milano also criticizes Kavanaugh for such constitutional truisms as his purported belief â€œa president should be able to ignore a law if he deems it unconstitutionalâ€ and the widely held opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted in normal federal criminal proceedings and that impeachment is the constitutionally available remedy, something that successive Republican and Democratic White Houses have asserted.

â€œWhat will happen when Brett Kavanaugh becomes the majority?â€ Milano asks, answering, based presumably on Kavanaughâ€™s record as a judge, â€œWe know what will happen to women, to immigrants, to workers, to voters, to people with pre-existing conditions, to children with disabilities, to parent who worry about whether their kids will come home from school alive.â€

â€œBrett Kavanaugh will hurt us,â€ the actress who has earned tens of millions of dollars from her roles claims. Later, she appears to define â€œusâ€ as â€œpretty much everyone except Donald Trump.â€

Brett Kavanaugh has been a particularly focal point of Milanoâ€™s anger recently. In addition to her claims in the Now This video, Milano dawned a costume from Huluâ€™s television adaptation of The Handmaidâ€™s Tale, claiming, in essence that Kavanaughâ€™s nomination would bring about some version of Margaret Atwoodâ€™s 1985 sci-fi dystopia the â€ Republic of Gilead.â€

3HFWPF5AKA1DGCHGG3R5C6H6W65S3T,Parkland Father Relives The Moment When Brett Kavanaugh Refused to Shake His Hand,"Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh's, confirmation hearing kicked off with fireworks on Tuesday as senators sparred with each other and a steady stream of protesters were removed.

But one of the most gut-wrenching moments came when a man who lost his 14-year-old daughter in a school shooting in Parkland, Florida tried to shake Kavanaugh's hand and the judge turned away.

The man was later identified as Fred Guttenberg, who has become a gun control activist after he lost his daughter, Jaime.

In the footage of the interaction, it's tough to hear what Guttenberg is saying until the end when he shouts, ""Keep walking away, that's okay.""

White House Deputy Press Secretary said that the incident was not what it looked like and that before Kavanaugh was able to shake Guttenberg's hand, security intervened.

On Tuesday night, Guttenberg appeared on CNN and said that he ""went up to [Kavanaugh] as a dad."" He explained that the NRA is filing lawsuits against state laws and pointed to a lawsuit in Florida where the organization sued the state after Governor Rick Scott signed a bill raising the minimum age to buy firearms from 18 to 21. Guttenberg went on to say, ""These lawsuits are going to end up in front of a Justice Kavanaugh.""

When asked about the White House's response that Kavanaugh didn't mean to walk away from Guttenberg, the father said, ""No, and that statement wasn't true."" He noted that he was a guest of Senator Dianne Feinstein and that she introduced him.

Kavanaugh has been a staunch advocate of the second amendment. He was in favor of allowing semi-automatic rifles to be carried in Washington D.C. and of looser registration regulations on the weapons. The NRA says that it spent at least $1 million on ads aimed at getting him confirmed to the Supreme Court.",https://ijr.com/2018/09/1121201-parkland-father-brett-kavanaugh-shake-hand/,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Neutral']","['5', '5', '5', '5', '3']"
3D06DR52261A223W5LATN5W6ADFMAF,â€˜Hereâ€™s how to cover the next school shooting in four simple stepsâ€™: A dark student meditation,"Student journalists at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in Maryland wanted to find a way to express the ugly reality of school shootings and just how common they have become. So they turned to what one called â€œdark satireâ€ to tell the story, and they did a powerful job of it, publishing this in the June edition of their student newspaper, The Tattler.



(From the Tattler, the newspaper of Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. Used with permission.)

Emily Schrader, 17, who is one of six members of the Tattlerâ€™s managing staff and one of three top editors for next year, said the newspaper team thought it was important to address what has been a prevailing theme for the last year: school shootings.

While the back page of the monthly newspaper is usually a piece of lighthearted comedy or satire, she said it was time to do something different. In what she called â€œdark satire,â€ the journalists decided to portray how students view the shootings.

â€œI think a lot of the reaction to school shootings recently is that students view it as predictable,â€ she said. â€œThereâ€™s this tragic predictability to it and the way it is reported, especially by school newspapers.â€

She said that in nearly every one of the 10 Tattler editions published this year, there has been a story about a school shooting somewhere. The final edition also includes a feature story titled, â€œGun owners for gun control: The truth behind the controversial AR-15,â€ by Lee Schwartz, who writes about discovering her uncle has an AR-15 and then going on â€œa hunt to understand why my family owns guns and yet can call themselves supporters of gun control.â€

Schrader worked primarily with another student Tattler editor, Sophia Saidi, to design the last page, and Schrader did the art work. She said the reaction at school has been mostly supportive, although people were a â€œa little surprised that we went there.â€

â€œItâ€™s not trying to insert the reader into a â€˜create your own shooting simulation,â€™ â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s a way to attempt to depict this tragedy, to put it into words when we are all at a loss for words.â€",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/06/13/heres-how-to-cover-the-next-school-shooting-in-four-simple-steps-a-dark-student-meditation/,"['Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Neutral']","['5', '3', '4', '5', '5']"

10 p.m.

Heavily armed agents have entered a Baltimore townhouse, the home of the father of the suspect in a deadly shooting at a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida.

Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said investigators believe 24-year-old David Katz of Baltimore was the shooter in an attack Sunday afternoon that left three people dead, including the suspect with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Eleven others were reported injured.

An FBI spokesman, Dave Fitz, confirmed agents had gone to the upscale townhouse home. But he did not immediately release any other specifics, citing an ongoing investigation.

The agents could be seen inside the home Sunday evening near Baltimoreâ€™s Inner Harbor. They wore bulletproof vests and carried long guns. Reporters who gathered outside did not see any authorities carrying any bags of evidence outside.

8:30 p.m.

An FBI official in Baltimore has confirmed that agents are searching the family home of the man authorities believe was behind a deadly shooting attack at a video game tournament at a Florida mall.

An FBI spokesman, Dave Fitz, says agents have gone to the suspectâ€™s fatherâ€™s house in Baltimore, hours after Sundayâ€™s mass shooting in Jacksonville, Florida. He did not immediately release any other specifics, citing an ongoing investigation.

Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said earlier Sunday that investigators believe 24-year-old David Katz of Baltimore was the shooter. The sheriff says three people were killed Sunday, including the suspect, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot.

T.J. Smith is the chief spokesman for the Baltimore Police Department. He says he could only confirm that the mid-Atlantic cityâ€™s force was assisting law enforcement partners â€œwith some information that has led authorities to Baltimore.â€

The Jacksonville sheriff says three people were killed, including the gunman, during a mass shooting at a video game tournament at a north Florida mall.

Sheriff Mike Williams said Sunday evening he believed the shooter is 24-year-old David Katz of Baltimore. He said the FBI was searching the manâ€™s home as part of the investigation.

Williams said nine other people were wounded by gunfire and are in stable condition and two others were hurt while fleeing the shots. He says the suspect died from a self-inflicted gunshot.

William said Katz committed the shooting with a single handgun. He said Katz was in Jacksonville for the â€œMadden NFL 19â€ video game tournament. The games maker, EA Sports, lists a David Katz as a 2017 championship winner.

A Chicago man says people trampled each other while fleeing the gunfire that broke out at a Florida mall during a video game tournament.

Twenty-year-old Marquis Williams says he and his girlfriend, Taylor Poindexter, also of Chicago, were ordering pizza close by when shots erupted. He said Sunday that he didnâ€™t think it was gunfire at first.

Says William, â€œInitially we thought it was a balloon popping, but there werenâ€™t any balloons in the room. Then we heard repeat shots and we took off running.â€

Williams had participated earlier Sunday in the gaming tournament where authorities say a mass shooting claimed multiple fatalities. He says he got a view of the back of the shooter in a green shirt.

He describes people running in the panic to escape. He says it was then that he scuffed his leg and that Poindexter was treated at a hospital for a sprained ankle. They later returned, hoping to retrieve her cell phone, but the scene was cordoned off by authorities.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott says President Donald Trump has called him, offering any federal help needed in response to a mass shooting during a video game tournament in Jacksonville.

Scott spokesman John Tupps said the governor also spoke Sunday with Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry and Sheriff Mike Williams.

The governor is preparing to fly from his home in Naples to Jacksonville and meet with investigators. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement and Florida Highway Patrol have been directed to help with the investigation.

An official close to the investigation said Sundayâ€™s shooting at a riverfront mall in Jacksonville has left four people dead.

An official close to the investigation says a mass shooting during a video game tournament at a Jacksonville, Florida, riverfront mall has left four people dead.

The official says the person who opened fire died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The official spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he wasnâ€™t authorized to release information on the shooting. It wasnâ€™t immediately clear if the official was including the suspect in the death toll.

Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said at a news conference Sunday afternoon that the suspect, a white male whose identity authorities are still seeking to confirm, had died. He did not elaborate, but said the shooting site had since been secured.

Several other people were taken to hospitals.

Sounds of the shooting were captured as the gaming tournament was being livestreamed.

It didnâ€™t take long for some Democratic candidates for governor to issue statements on a mass shooting in Jacksonville that left multiple people dead.

In the wake of the Feb. 14 Parkland school shooting that left 17 dead, gun violence has been a major issue ahead of Tuesdayâ€™s primary election, in which voters will pick the Republican and Democratic nominees to replace outgoing Republican Gov. Rick Scott.

Former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham sent an email to supporters that said the only way to end mass shootings is to â€œvote out the politicians complicit in this cycle of death.â€

Former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine also released a statement saying, â€œI am horrified and I am furiousâ€ and that itâ€™s time for new leaders.

Video game manufacturer Electronic Arts tweeted, â€œThis is a horrible situation, and our deepest sympathies go out to all involved.â€

3RWO3EJELIRKTHN91I9ST8XYB2L1PV,Bernie would be proud,"First time Candidate Sara McFadden taking on RED SWFL with determination - just like Bernie asked!

Three years ago I was a registered NPA. Bernie inspired me to become a leader in my local Democratic party and a candidate for State House. Now Iâ€™m taking on a GOP incumbent in a race most people thought we could never win and sparking a grassroots movement in my own backyard. If weâ€™re going to change this country, we need to take races like mine seriously and rebuild our democracy from the bottom up. This can â€“ and must - be our legacy.

In 2015 I was living in Florida as a registered NPA. I had lived in the Northeast, so I knew about and admired VT Senator Bernie Sanders, but when I read his platform for the presidential race I got fired up.

I started donating to his campaign, which in itself was atypical for me. I changed my party affiliation to Democrat to vote for him. I learned how to use twitter to find news about him and within a month I had 1800 followers.

The Sanders Campaign encouraged me to run to be a Bernie Delegate to the DNC Convention in Philadelphia. I only knew two Democrats at the time and it took me three days to find a local Democratic organization and a month to find the leaders and join the County Democratic Executive Committee.

After weeks of hard work and campaigning, I came in third, losing by 8 votes. The race was ultimately decided by a coin toss, but I so enjoyed the process that I committed to traveling to Philadelphia for the Convention anyway. The Delegate and I had become close and I was invited to be a roommate in the house she rented with friends. I've always found Philly to be friendly, but it was ALIVE with Bernie LOVE- murals, political discussions on corners and in restaurants, and locals willing to walk with you to help you find a venue or a place to charge your cell phone.

It was heartbreaking to experience Bernie's last Convention appearance, but by then I was hooked. I had been going to statewide meetings - including the National Platform meeting in Orlando that year - and was committed to prepare and be ready to run for State Committeewoman should the opportunity arise. When HRC lost by 29 points in our county, I was approached to run. A month later, I won the election with 78% of the vote.

I was determined with others to bring grassroots to the state party and bring attention to RED SW Florida so I arranged and moderated the first forum in the state for the FDP Chair Candidates and organized an eight county coalition to share best practices. Within three months I was appointed as a Vice Chair of the Florida Democratic Party. I raised money for candidates, brought in expert training from the state party and contracted with a political consultant to encourage people to run for office. One day I woke up thinking ""I could do that""... so I did. I never realized I was looking for me!

People told me it was ""too hard, you won't win, we can't help you.â€ The last person to run as a Democrat in my District was in 1978 and they lost. But we canâ€™t keep giving up and we canâ€™t win if weâ€™re not on the ballot. Thereâ€™s too much at stake. So, I filed my campaign in October 2017 as a Candidate for FL State Representative / House District 106!

And yes, it's been an uphill battle. I had to build infrastructure, find people with institutional knowledge and convince the naysayers, but it's working and it's the most exciting thing I have ever done! Our opponent is far right with Koch $$$ and a 93% NRA rating, but our campaign now has 10 state-level endorsements, has been ahead with ""cash on hand"" since May, and we WON more contributions the last reporting period!

Come November we are going to flip this district and I need your help to make sure we win! Take a minute to like our social media, share this campaign and fund our outreach with a donation.

Thanks!

3YLTXLH3DGOVXS8N37CDLVD5SRGHP9,This marks the end of gun control,"The federal government has finally recognized the obvious â€“ that sharing instructions on how to make guns with 3D printers counts as constitutionally protected speech. Despite little fanfare, this is an important victory for First Amendment rights. It also represents a real blow to the increasingly futile cause of gun control.

The U.S. Justice Department announced a legal settlement and its surrender to the First Amendment arguments July 10 made in a case brought by Cody Wilson, founder of Defense Distributed. Wilson, 25, created a ruckus in May 2013 when he announced his successful design of a plastic gun. In just two days, 100,000 copies of the handgun blueprint were downloaded from Wilsonâ€™s website.

The most downloads came from Spain, followed by the U.S., Brazil and Germany. The heavy downloading in Spain, Brazil and Germany likely reflected attempts to evade extremely restrictive handgun regulations in those countries.

People are going to download these files whether they're legal or not. As we've seen with movies, file sharing is unstoppable. The most pirated TV program in 2017 was the seventh season of â€œGame of Thrones,â€ with well over 10 million illegal downloads in most weeks.

Within days of the gun file being uploaded, the Obama State Department served Wilson with a letter threatening criminal prosecution for violating federal export controls. Wilson immediately complied with the order, but there was no way to stop further downloading.

Within a week of the initial uploading, the file could be downloaded on the Internet from over 4,000 different computers around the world.

The Justice Departmentâ€™s recent settlement with Wilson is very favorable to him, allowing Wilson to provide the printing instructions â€œfor public release (meaning unlimited distribution) in any form.â€ The government also compensated $40,000 of Wilsonâ€™s legal costs.

Someone has just as much right to release the instructions in a computer file as in a book or newspaper article. The groups that submitted arguments on Wilson's behalf were ideologically diverse, ranging from conservative self-defense advocacy groups to the Reportersâ€™ Committee for Freedom of the Press and Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Anyone with access to a metal 3D printer can make guns functionally and aesthetically indistinguishable from any gun that can be bought in a store. Such metal printers are available for less than $2,000.

How the government will stop people from obtaining these printers isnâ€™t exactly obvious. Proposals to require background checks, mandatory serial numbers and even a registration process for printers are easily defeated. Even if printers are registered with the government, what is going to stop gangs from stealing them? And the designs for making your own printer have been available on the Internet for years.

3D printers make the already extremely difficult job of controlling access to guns practically impossible. The government is not going to be able to ban guns, and limits on the size of bullet magazines will be even more laughable than before. Many parts of a gun can be made on very inexpensive, plastic 3D printers or even from simple machine tools.

It will be even more difficult to impose background checks, which have proven quite useless anyway. The government has been no more effective at stopping criminals from getting guns than at stopping them from obtaining drugs. That isnâ€™t too surprising, as drug gangs are the source of both illegal drugs and guns.

The goal of eliminating guns is ultimately a foolâ€™s errand. Every place in the world that we have crime data for that has banned all guns or all handguns has seen a subsequent increase in murder rates. Even island nations such as Ireland and Jamaica â€“ with coastlines that are more easily monitored and defended than land borders would be â€“ have faced five- or six-fold increases in murder rates after guns were banned.

It is understandable that governments want to regulate 3D printing, but gutting the First Amendment is too high a cost. This settlement may bring some awareness to the futility of gun control regulations that only disarm the law-abiding.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/07/20/this-marks-end-gun-control.html,"['Strongly Republican', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Republican', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Republican']","['5', '5', '5', '4', '5']"

""[Florida Department of Law Enforcement] is currently responding, and I have spoken to FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen regarding the shooting in Jacksonville. We will continue to receive updates from law enforcement.""

He has since tweeted that he has spoken with the city's mayor, Lenny Curry.

Rep. Charlie Crist, D-Fla., offered his prayers in a tweet.

""Devastated by reports of another mass shooting in Florida,"" he wrote. ""Praying for all involved. But more than prayers, we need action to stop such senseless violence in our communities.""

Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., also took to Twitter regarding the situation.

""Our prayers go out to those killed and injured in #Jacksonville shooting, and we hope shooter will be brought to justice. #Sayfie â¦â¦@Everytownâ© â¦@CityofJaxâ©,"" he said.

Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi shared her thoughts.

""Praying for Jacksonville and the victims of this horrific attack. My advocates are there assisting @JSOPIOâ€”helping the victims,"" the Republican shared.

Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., urged people to follow warnings from law enforcement.

""Word of another tragic mass shooting in our state brings shock and outrage,"" he tweeted. ""Right now, law enforcement are doing their jobs under horrific circumstances and itâ€™s important that people in the Jacksonville area heed their warnings.""

Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., opened up about his emotions over the incident.

""Once more left speechless and exasperated as yet another mass shooting claims young innocent lives,"" he said. ""My heart is with all the victims and their families during this unimaginably painful time.""

""Another tragic loss of life to gun violence in Jacksonville today,"" Ellison, also deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, wrote. ""We must keep fighting for common sense measures to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of criminals and those who pose a risk to themselves or others.""

Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., urged Twitter followers to adhere to guidance from the sheriff's office.

""Horrified by what has transpired at The Landing,"" he said. ""As we pray for the victims and all the emergency personnel responding to this tragedy, please follow guidance from @JSOPIO as they work to secure the area.""

Kaitlin Bennett, a pro-Second Amendment supporter and Grassroots Director for Liberty Hangout, shared a clip on July 4 where she fired the gun that made her an Internet star. She wore a â€œUSAâ€ T-shirt and cut-off jean shorts as she pulled the trigger.

â€œRemember that big scary rifle I brought to Kent State for my graduation photos?â€ Bennett tweeted. â€œHereâ€™s how that baby fires.â€

The gun supporter used the hashtag â€œsuperscaryâ€ in an eight-second video where she is seen shooting the AR-10 before turning and saying â€œso scaryâ€ to the camera with a smile on her face.

Bennett told Fox News she figured ""a little blonde girl firing the AR-10 would break stereotypes and show that shooting rifles isn't as scary as it's made out to be.""

""If I can do it, anyone can,"" she said.

Bennett went viral in May after she posed with the gun immediately following her graduation from Kent State to condemn the school's ""insulting"" anti-gun policies.

""The entire outrage over my graduation photos and subsequent Twitter infamy has only made me stronger in my beliefs and activism,"" she said.

Bennett said she was recently stalked and threatened in a restaurant but she isn't backing down.

Republican Gov. Rick Scott and incumbent Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson have emerged as the frontrunners in whatâ€™s expected to be an extremely costly election.

The fact that a sitting U.S. senator and a sitting governor will likely square off in the race is a rarity, Dr. Susan MacManus, a University of South Florida professor and expert on Floridian politics, told Fox News.

â€œItâ€™s two people with understanding of grassroots-level campaigning, two state politicians with two different views of the world,â€ MacManus said. â€œItâ€™s a clash of titans, I would say.â€

Hereâ€™s a look at the contentious Senate race.

The Republicans

Gov. Rick Scott, 65, officially declared his candidacy for Senate in April 2018.

To win, Scott shouldnâ€™t try to paint himself as a political outsider â€“ after all, heâ€™s spent the past seven years as Floridaâ€™s governor â€“ but should discuss congressional term limits as a way to differentiate himself from Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, who has been involved in Florida politics for decades, MacManus said.

He should also tout his success in bringing jobs to the state. Scott, in announcing his candidacy, said nearly 1.5 million jobs were added under his governing; PolitiFact said Scott brought about 86 percent of the jobs he promised to the state â€“ and he still has a few more months in office.

Scott, who is term-limited, got his first experience in Florida politics as its governor. He is a Navy veteran.

Also gunning for the Republican nomination is Roque De La Fuente, who sought offices this year in a handful of states, including California.

The Democrats

Incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, 75, has represented Florida in the Senate for more than 17 years. Before he was senator, he served in the state legislature and the U.S. House.

It was while he was a congressman that he was able to join the crew on the space shuttle Columbia in 1986 for six days.

To win, Nelson needs to be able to get voters, particularly minorities, to come out to vote, Dr. Gregory Koger, a political science professor at the University of Miami, told Fox News.

""I think if he campaigns as a real Democrat, a real member of the party who is interested in checking the president, thatâ€™s probably a strong message for him,"" Koger said.

In the Senate, Nelson serves on the Armed Services and Finance committees.

Nelson has not had a serious challenger since 2000.

The District

Trump narrowly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in Florida in the 2016 presidential race by less than 2 percentage points, according to Fox Newsâ€™ election results.

Fox News has ranked the election a toss-up.

â€œFlorida statewide elections tend to be fairly competitive,â€ Dr. Kevin Wagner, a Florida Atlantic University political scientist, told Fox News. â€œFlorida is a purple state that neither side can win, and thatâ€™s increasingly uncommon [nationally].â€

â€œThe fact that the president essentially lives here, comes on a regular basis, will make it hard for Republicans in the state to claim they do not know him or stay away from him.â€ - Dr. Gregory Koger, University of Miami political science professor

Wagner said both sides will need an assist from their national parties in order to win in the fall.

â€œFlorida is a very large state and a very expensive state to run in,â€ Wagner said, adding that Scott may already have a slight advantage as heâ€™s already shown, through his gubernatorial campaigns, that he is willing to spend his own money.

The issues

President Trump: Itâ€™s inevitable that the president will play a role in the race â€“ for better or for worse, depending on votersâ€™ opinions of Trump. Itâ€™s not uncommon for midterm elections to become a sort of â€œproxy on how the president is doing,"" Wagner said.

But Trumpâ€™s visibility certainly is heightened in the state given Mar-a-Lago, Trumpâ€™s Palm Beach, Florida resort considered to be a â€œwinter White House.â€

â€œThe fact that the president essentially lives here, comes on a regular basis, will make it hard for Republicans in the state to claim they do not know him or stay away from him,â€ Koger said. â€œHis presence here will be a constant reminder of the agenda of this administration.â€

â€œSo much more than other states, this election will probably be a referendum on the president, and that wonâ€™t do well for the Republican Party,â€ Koger said.

Gun control: In less than two years, Florida has seen two of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history â€“ the Pulse nightclub attack in 2016 and the Parkland high school shooting in 2018.

Despite his A-plus rating with the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobbying firm, Scott ultimately signed Floridaâ€™s new law raising the age limit to purchase rifles to 21 and creating a new process enabling law enforcement to seize guns from someone who is considered a danger.

Nelson has advocated for universal background checks and a ban on certain types of semi-automatic rifles.

Puerto Rico: Following the devastating hurricanes in 2017, particularly Hurricane Maria, more than 200,000 Puerto Ricans have relocated to Florida, at least temporarily, according to NBC News. And neither Nelson nor Scott have wasted time in courting the votes of those who have moved to the Sunshine State.

â€œThe administrationâ€™s poor response to Puerto Rico will probably hurt Rick Scott,â€ Koger said, although adding that Scott hasnâ€™t been as â€œanti-immigrant as President Trump.â€

Both Nelson and Scott have visited Puerto Rico since the hurricanes. Wagner noted that thereâ€™s typically not a high voter turnout among this demographic of people, but the hurricanes could change that this year.

36MUZ9VAE7KAOLEV8XDC0YZ3M5DDET,Father blames 'stand your ground' in son's parking-lot death,"Michael McGlockton is convinced that two things killed his son in a Florida parking lot last month: The man who pulled the trigger and the state's polarizing ""stand your ground"" self-defense law.

Markeis McGlockton, 28, died a few yards from his children and girlfriend at a store in Clearwater after a confrontation over a parking spot that reignited the debate over the law. The local sheriff said that under ""stand your ground,"" Michael Drejka was justified in the killing.

In an interview with The Associated Press â€” his first one-on-one with a news outlet since the shooting â€” Michael McGlockton said that if the law didn't exist, his son might have gone home the night of July 19, or Drejka might have been arrested. Instead, McGlockton said, he buried his firstborn while the killer walked free.

""No law should be able to protect somebody to the point that they kill somebody on the street and they can lay in the bed the same night,"" McGlockton said. ""To me and my family, that's a slap in the face. (Drejka) would've thought twice before he pulled the trigger. With the law, he knew that he could hide behind that.""

The law received international attention in 2012 when black teenager Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman. In the end, Zimmerman did not argue a ""stand your ground"" defense and was acquitted anyway. Critics say the law unfairly allows young black men to be victimized by gun violence.

The dispute with Drejka started when he yelled at McGlockton's girlfriend, Britany Jacobs â€” who was in a car with two of the couple's small children â€” outside a store for parking in a handicapped space. McGlockton, who was black and unarmed, pushed Drejka, a white man, to the ground. Drejka pulled out his handgun and killed him.

Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri has declined to press charges. State prosecutors are considering whether to charge Drejka, 47.

""I didn't make the law, and I do not do what people want because of outrage,"" Gualtieri said. ""If you're outraged by the law and don't like the law, then change it.""

The case drew hundreds to a rally last weekend in Clearwater.

Instead of scrapping the law, Florida lawmakers have strengthened it to force prosecutors to prove the shooting doesn't fall under a ""stand your ground"" defense. Previously, defendants had to prove why that defense applied.

A 2015 American Bar Association task force report on ""stand your ground laws"" found the statute is unpredictable, results in racial disparities, and undermines victims' rights. Additionally, the report said there was widespread confusion among law enforcement as to when shootings were justified.

Georgetown University law professor Paul Butler said the law does have a racially disparate effect that devalues black life. Because the law is predicated on the belief that an imminent threat exists, shootings are more likely to be considered justified by a judge or jury when white people shoot blacks, he said.

""White fear is seen as more reasonable than black fear,"" Butler said.

Dennis Baxley, a Republican legislator from Ocala and an initial ""stand your ground"" sponsor, says the law's intent was to make it clear that when people are attacked, they have a right to defend themselves.

""I don't think anyone should be raped or beaten because they think they would get in trouble for defending themselves,"" Baxley said.

Baxley called the Clearwater case a ""tough call"" but said it's up to the sheriff and prosecutor to decide whether a crime was committed.

Markeis McGlockton was 23 when Martin was killed in 2012. It was the first time Michael McGlockton, a lifelong Florida resident, had heard of ""stand your ground."" He said he thought the ""messed-up"" law should be changed but never imagined it would strike so personally.

McGlockton said it is his son who was defending himself and his family against a threat.

""Every man raises his kid to be that ultimate man for his family,"" McGlockton said. ""That's exactly what he was doing, standing up for his family. I'm so proud of him because he did exactly what I taught him to do.""

Nearly 30 years ago, McGlockton was sitting in Spanish class as a high school junior when he got the call that his girlfriend was in labor.

He rushed to the hospital, but by the time he arrived, Markeis had already entered the world. It was the best day of Michael's life.

""I stayed with him all night, crying,"" Michael McGlockton, now 46, recalled. ""I was just happy.""

Father and son were close. He chided his father for babying him, even as an adult. Warning him away from the mistakes he had made was simply McGlockton's way of showing love â€” a word he began using with his son only a few years ago.

""A lot of grown men don't really say that to their sons,"" McGlockton said.

Their hometown, Clearwater, known for its beaches and sunshine, bills itself as ""a progressive city committed to enhancing residents' lives."" McGlockton wouldn't disagree, and seldom thought of Markeis' safety as the father of a black son.

But ""this law does not work in favor of black people,"" he said.

Like Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, Michael McGlockton and Monica Moore-Robinson want justice for their son's killing. He no longer wants or expects an apology from sheriff Gualtieri and regrets voting for him.

McGlockton hopes for a different outcome from prosecutors.

""Everybody in America can see that tape,"" McGlockton said, referring to the video of the confrontation. ""I'm hoping the state's attorney can see the exact same thing.""

McGlockton's family is focused on pushing for Drejka's arrest, prosecution and conviction. Then, he said, he'll focus on pushing to change the law.

""He didn't have to pull that trigger,"" McGlockton said. ""But because of 'stand your ground,' this is what happens.""

31N9JPQXIQ0VU7WANSZLH68ASCFHND,Trump backtracks on Russian meddling statement,"Happy Tuesday, OP fam, and welcome to this edition of ""Did President Trump Really Mean to Say What He Said?""

Keep up with the latest, get your friends to subscribe and let's go.

And words are all I have

Did it really just come down to a contraction?

After nearly 24 hours of backlash from people on both sides of the aisle, President Donald Trump said he misspoke during his news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

As USA TODAY's John Fritze reports, when Trump said he couldn't see any reason why Russia ""would"" have been involved in the U.S. presidential election, what he meant to say was ""wouldn't.""

""I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't,'"" Trump explained, speaking at the White House. ""The sentence should have been, 'I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia.'""

""I think that probably clarifies things pretty good by itself.""

That explanation may not be good enough for congressional GOP leaders, who are unequivocally saying that Russia meddled in 2016 and are looking for ways to counter the president further. And whatever the president meant, election experts worry that his words could embolden hackers looking to disrupt the upcoming midterm elections.

To take your heart away

Want to anonymously donate to some tax-exempt organizations? You're in luck.

USA TODAY's Fredreka Schouten reports that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced this week that his agency would no longer force some of those organizations, including politically active groups such as the National Rifle Association, to identify their contributors to the IRS.

The change drew protests Tuesday from campaign finance watchdogs, who say it strips the government of its ability to scrutinize those donations and could lead to foreign interests illegally infiltrating U.S. elections through advocacy groups.

""This is the theater of the absurd,"" said Fred Wertheimer of the watchdog group Democracy 21. ""By limiting donor disclosures to the IRS, they have limited any ability to prevent Russia and Russian oligarchs to launder unlimited, undisclosed and illegal contributions through advocacy groups into federal elections.""

Gillum, who received the backing of prominent socialist figures including Sen. Bernie Sanders and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, defeated Rep. Gwen Graham and former mayor of Miami beach Phillip Levine with 34.3 percent of the vote. He was also endorsed and funded by left-wing billionaires such as Tom Steyer and George Soros.

Congratulations, @AndrewGillum! The progressive movement is transforming the country â€“ and he proved that again tonight. Gillum ran on Medicare for All, Legalizing Marijuana, #AbolishICE &amp; more. Thank you, Florida voters! On to November https://t.co/8keyzxVmcf â€” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) August 29, 2018

Congratulations to @AndrewGillum on his victory. Tonight, Floridians joined Andrew in standing up and demanding real change and showed our nation what is possible when we stand together. Let's make history this November and make Andrew Gillum the next Governor of Florida. â€” Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 29, 2018

President Donald Trump immediately mocked Gillumâ€™s candidacy, describing him as a â€œfailed socialist mayorâ€ who has allowed â€œcrime [and] many other problems to flourish in his city.â€

Not only did Congressman Ron DeSantis easily win the Republican Primary, but his opponent in November is his biggest dreamâ€¦.a failed Socialist Mayor named Andrew Gillum who has allowed crime &amp; many other problems to flourish in his city. This is not what Florida wants or needs! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2018

Gillum ran on a platform of universal health care, a $15 an hour minimum wage, abolishing ICE, and passing onerous gun control laws. He has previously starred in videos calling for Trumpâ€™s impeachment.

However, Hollywood elites such as Michael Moore, Alyssa Milano, Debra Messing, Piper Perabo, Don Cheadle, Rob Delaney, and John Leguizamo took to Twitter to celebrate the victory of another â€œprogressive insurgent,â€ while also expressing excitement over the prospect of the stateâ€™s first-ever black governor.

Aliâ€” you can say he was Hillary backed if you felt you had to make the point that he (obviously) wasnâ€™t backed by Trump. Hillaryâ€™s platform WAS progressive. Gillum most aligns with Hillary.

In an interview on Tuesday with Laura Ingraham, DeSantis claimed that Gillum was a man who â€œcombines a far-left ideology with managerial incompetence.â€

â€œHe is the most liberal candidate that the Democratic Party has ever nominated in the state of Florida, by a country mile, in a governorâ€™s race,â€ DeSantis explained. â€œHe wants to abolish ICE. He wants a billion-dollar tax increase. He wants a single-payer healthcare system in Florida, which would bankrupt the state.â€

â€œIâ€™m trying to make Florida even better. He wants to make Florida Venezuela,â€ he continued. â€œBut he also combines a far-left ideology with managerial incompetence. As mayor of Tallahassee, his tenure has been absolutely disastrous. Tallahassee is one of, if not the most crime-ridden city in all of Florida, year after year, rising crime. Heâ€™s embroiled in a lot of corruption scandals.â€

Gillum has also been endorsed and supported by All in the Family creator Norman Lear, producers Will Packer and Shonda Rhimes, as well as actresses Regina Hall, Debra Messing, and Issa Rae.

3VCK0Q0PO6WKJ7QEPKS0BE9T6VDN0H,"Incumbents Curbelo, Murphy win big in Florida congressional primaries","Republican Carlos Curbelo and Democrat Stephanie Murphy were projected to coast to victory in two of Florida's U.S. House primaries Tuesday night as closely watched matchups in November's battle for the House of Representatives began coming into focus.

National Democrats have eyed Curbelo's 26th congressional district as a potential pickup target, in large part because it voted heavily for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. But with almost all precincts reporting, approximately 2,500 more people had turned out to vote in the GOP primary than in the Democratic primary.

Curbelo garnered 84 percent of the vote against primary opponent Souraya Faas, who described Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad as ""heroes"" and claimed chemical attacks in Syria's civil war were ""staged by [humanitarian group] the White Helmets.""

In November, Curbelo will face Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a former associate dean at the Florida International University Medical School and Democratic candidate for state Senate. She defeated Navy veteran Demetries Grimes in the Democratic primary.

Murphy, who unseated GOP incumbent John Mica in 2016, easily defeated a primary challenge in the 7th District from Chardo Richardson, who was backed by New York democratic socialist candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She will face Florida state Rep. Mike Miller in November's general election.

In the 5th District, incumbent Democrat Rep. Al Lawson defeated former Jacksonville mayor Alvin Brown, who slammed Lawson as ""Trump's favorite Democrat"" after he was seen applauding during President Trump's State of the Union address earlier this year.

Lawson will be a heavy favorite to keep his seat against Republican Virginia Fuller, who did not face a primary opponent.

In the 18th District, Republican Brian Mast garnered 78 percent of the vote, more than enough to see off two Republican challengers -- Mark Freeman and Dave Cummings, each of whom received approximately 11 percent of the vote.

In April, Freeman told the Sun-Sentinel newspaper that he was motivated to challenge Mast after the congressman backed tighter gun laws, including an ""assault weapons"" ban, in the wake of the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. He vowed to ""defend the Second Amendment"" and be an ""unwavering partner"" to President Trump. For his part, Cummings called Mast's support for an assault weapons ban ""just lousy policy.""

Mast will defend his seat against Democrat Lauren Baer, an attorney who served in the Obama administration as a senior adviser to Clinton and John Kerry during their tenures as secretary of state.

Another Republican who defeated two challengers was Rep. Matt Gaetz, one of Trump's most staunch defenders. Gaetz received 62 percent of the vote, compared to 33 percent for his main challenger, small business owner Cris Dosev. He will face Democrat Jennifer Zimmerman in November as a heavy favorite for re-election.

Other incumbents who won contested primaries include Republican Ted Yoho (3rd District), Democrats Darren Soto (9th District), Val Demings (10th District), Alcee Hastings (20th District), Ted Deutch (22nd District) and Frederica Wilson (24th District). All six are expected to hold on to their seats in November; Demings, Hastings and Wilson don't even have a Republican opponent.

Soto's win was notable in that it represented another failed comeback attempt for former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, who formerly represented the 9th District for two terms before resigning to pursue a failed run for U.S. Senate in 2016.

In the 6th District, Republican Michael Waltz won his party's primary to replace Rep. Ron DeSantis, who resigned his seat to run for governor. He will face Democrat Nancy Soderberg, a former National Security Council official during the Clinton administration.

In the 13th District, disaster management consultant George Buck defeated Brad Sostak for the right to face former governor and Republican-turned-Independent-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist, who did not have a primary opponent. The 13th District narrowly went for Clinton in 2016, and is likely the best chance Republicans have to flip a seat in the Sunshine State.

In the 23rd District, Republican Joe Kaufman will get another shot at unseating former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Kaufman, who defeated Carlos Reyes and Carla Spalding in Tuesday's primary, previously lost to Wasserman Schultz in 2014 and 2016.",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/28/incumbents-curbelo-murphy-win-big-in-florida-congressional-primaries.html,"['Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Republican']","['1', '3', '1', '2', '4']"
367O8HRHKHQYY80KGHWOMB9CA61S4E,Chicago shootings put spotlight on Illinois gun laws,"After an exceptionally violent weekend in Chicago that left nearly a dozen people dead, Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration is among those being blamed for the outbreak.

About 70 people were hurt and 11 killed â€“ ages 11 to 63 â€“ over the weekend as gun violence erupted in Chicago. One teenager was shot while riding a bike; other shootings took place at a block party and funeral.

Emanuelâ€™s challengers in his campaign for re-election have blamed him for an understaffed police force and a lack of investment in Chicagoâ€™s economically downtrodden neighborhoods. In turn, Emanuel encouraged people in neighborhoods where gun violence is most prevalent to â€œspeak up.â€

The violence has also raised questions, however, about the impact of gun laws. The city does not have the toughest gun laws in the country, as some have claimed. But Illinois is ranked eighth among states with the strongest gun laws by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Read on for a look at some of the gun laws in Illinois and Chicago specifically.

Licensing

To purchase a firearm in Illinois, one must obtain a Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card.

To obtain a FOID card, one must be a legal citizen of the U.S. and have a valid driverâ€™s license. The cards cost $10.

TWO MORE KILLED IN CHICAGO SHOOTINGS FOLLOWING BLOODY WEEKEND OF GUN VIOLENCE

FOID cards will not be issued to anyone who has been convicted of domestic battery, aggravated domestic battery or a similar offense. They also wonâ€™t be issued to anyone who has been a patient at a mental institution or treated for a mental illness in the past 5 years.

Minimum age to purchase

Illinois residents must be 21 to obtain a FOID card. However, individuals who are at least 18 years old can legally possess a firearm and ammunition with the written consent of an eligible parent or legal guardian.

Concealed carry

Individuals at least 21 years of age â€“ who have not been treated for alcohol or drug abuse or been convicted of a misdemeanor related to the use of physical force in the past five years â€“ can apply for a concealed carry license.

MORE CHICAGO OFFICERS DEPLOYED TO AREAS AFFECTED BY GUN VIOLENCE

In order to apply, one must have at least 16 hours of concealed carry firearms training by a certified instructor with valid certification. The application fee is $150 for residents and $300 for non-residents.

Waiting periods

The state of Illinois has waiting periods for the sale of guns. According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the waiting period is 24 hours for long guns and 72 hours for handguns.

However, non-Illinois residents do not have to adhere to the waiting period when purchasing long guns at gun shows, according to the nonprofit.

The waiting periods give the Illinois Department of State Police the time to approve or deny the purchase of guns at licensed dealers and gun shows, according to the law center.

Open carry

Open carry is prohibited in the state of Illinois within city, village or incorporated town limits, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. This does not apply to a personâ€™s own land, home or business.

There are some exemptions to this ban, including for concealed carry holders who might have a partially exposed handgun, according to the nonprofit.

Red flag law

Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican, signed the stateâ€™s red flag law in July 2018. The law allows for police to temporarily seize firearms from someone deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.

HEATâ€™S ON IN RAHMâ€™S RE-ELECTION RACE AFTER BLOODY WEEKEND OF GUN VIOLENCE

Family members or other individuals, such as a roommate, can seek a court order of protection for the confiscation of firearms.

Firearms ban

The city of Chicago has banned more than 150 types of guns. This ban includes: semiautomatic handguns or rifles with a detachable magazine, semiautomatic rifles with a magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds and shotguns with a revolving cylinder.

Gun stores

In Chicago, gun stores, which are only allowed in designated areas in the city, must record on video the sales of firearms.

Individuals can also only purchase guns once every month.

Gun store employees also have to pass background checks and be trained on how to spot individuals who might be purchasing a gun for someone else.

Silencers

Itâ€™s illegal to possess a silencer, according to the lobbying arm of the National Rifle Association.

3M67TQBQQI6VVIK2GC6OIJQMAGUA9U,California Tries New Tack on Gun Violence: Ammunition Control,"SACRAMENTO â€” Sold from vending machines in Pennsylvania, feed depots in Nevada, pharmacies in Georgia and jewelry stores in Texas, ammunition is in many states easier to buy than cold medicine. But in California, which already enforces some of the nationâ€™s most restrictive gun laws, there is a movement underway against the unfettered sale of bullets.

Gun control advocates here have pushed to limit internet sales, ban large-capacity magazines, require sellers to have licenses, raise taxes on bullets, and mandate serial numbers or other traceable markings on ammunition so that the police can more easily track them.

Such regulations, several of which have been enacted and take effect this year and next, are inspired by the view that the best way to limit gun violence is to approach it as a â€œbullet controlâ€ problem. As Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat from New York, told the Senate 25 years ago, when he introduced legislation that would have imposed a 10,000-percent tax on hollow-tip ammunition, â€œguns donâ€™t kill people; bullets do.â€

Across the country, bullets remain subject to far fewer federal restrictions than the weapons that fire them. Purchasing ammunition typically requires no form of identification, is handed over with no questions asked and, in most of the country, can be ordered online and delivered to doorsteps. In contrast, gun dealers have to keep detailed sales records of firearms and generally have to be licensed. If someone buys more than one handgun, the purchase is reported to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Gun buyers usually have to pass background checks.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/09/us/california-gun-control-ammunition-bullets.html,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic']","['5', '3', '5', '5', '5']"
31YWE12TE1U3DC42CP0IOVAEGNTX7B,Dem's campaign manager quits after video shows candidate secretly backing gun ban,"The campaign manager of a Democrat seeking a U.S. House seat in upstate New York quit the campaign Tuesday, after a video showed the candidate saying she wouldn't publicly endorse a ban on certain firearms -- for fear that sheâ€™d lose the election.

Mike Szustak, who since April had run the campaign of candidate Tedra Cobb, told the Watertown Daily Times that heâ€™s no longer part of Cobb's bid to unseat Republican incumbent Elise Stefanik in New York's 21st Congressional District.

The departure follows revelations that Cobb wonâ€™t publicly state that she favors banning assault rifles. The video was first revealed by the Washington Free Beacon. Fox News also reported on the video.

NEW YORK DEM RUNNING FOR US HOUSE SEAT BACK GUN BAN â€“ BUT WONâ€™T SAY SO PUBLICLY

""When I was at this thing today, it was the first table I was at, a woman said, â€˜How do you feel about assault rifles?' And I said they should be banned,"" Cobb is heard telling a group of teens in the video.

""And I said, you know, people were getting up to go, to go get their lunch because it was a buffet, and I just said to her, 'I want you to know, Cindy, I cannot say that,â€ she added.

""When I was at this thing today, it was the first table I was at, a woman said, â€˜How do you feel about assault rifles?' And I said they should be banned."" - Tedra Cobb

The Democrat went on to explain that she cannot publicly come out in support of a gun ban as that will doom her election chances.

""And she said, â€˜Well, I want you to,' and I said, â€˜I won't win,'"" Cobb said. ""I said Moms Demand [Action] says, and Tricia Pleau [member of the gun-control group Moms Demand Action] said, â€˜Do not say that you want an assault rifle ban because you will not win.'""

Cobb has a platform for addressing gun violence nationwide, including the expansion of universal background checks and banning of bump stocks -- devices that make a semiautomatic weapon fire like an automatic weapon. But none of her official proposals suggest banning any type of firearms.

The Republican Party jumped on the issue last week, issuing a stark attack on Cobb, calling her â€œwildly out of touchâ€ and accusing her of â€œlying to voters.â€

""Tedra Cobb knows that she's wildly out of touch with the district, so she's desperately trying to hide her liberal agenda from voters,"" Chris Martin, regional press secretary of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told the Free Beacon.

3NRZ1LDP7XOHOD8H9TIKL2HAOHXZPH,Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel not seeking re-election,"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced Tuesday that he is not seeking re-election -- despite raising $10 million toward his bid for a third term.

""Today, the time has come to make another tough choice. As much as I love this job and will always love this city and its residents, I have decided not to seek re-election,"" Emanuel, 58, said in a statement released by his office.

""This has been the job of a lifetime, but it is not a job for a lifetime. You hire us to get things done - and pass the torch when we've done our best to do what you hired us to do,"" he said.

""I have approached public service the only way I know how for the last 23 years -- giving 100 percent, 24 hours a day, seven days a week -- for President Clinton, in Congress and in its leadership, as President Obama's Chief of Staff and finally as your Mayor,"" he continued.

""For the last seven and a half years I've given my all every day and left everything on the field. This commitment has required significant sacrifice all around. Now, with our three kids in college, Amy and I have decided it is time for us to write a new chapter together.""

Emanuel assumed office on May 16, 2011, replacing Richard Daley, who served for more than two decades.

His stunning announcement comes the day before the start of one of the biggest police-shooting trials in the history of the Windy City -- the murder trial of police officer Jason Van Dyke.

The release of a dash-cam video two years ago of the white cop shooting black teen Laquan McDonald 16 times in 2014 drew the sharpest criticism of Emanuel.

Many questioned whether his office delayed releasing the footage to limit political damage on Emanuel amid a federal civil-rights investigation of the city's police department and calls for his resignation.

Despite the furor, the mayor weathered the storm and oversaw sweeping changes on the police force, including naming a new superintendent, overhauling training and instituting the use of body cams while equipping all officers with Tasers.

Emanuel also had incurred the wrath of some voters for record property taxes he instituted to help fund police employee pensions and for closing 50 schools in 2013, according to the Tribune.

His administration also has struggled to address recent spikes in gun violence - including a recent weekend in which 64 were shot, 12 fatally.

Chicago recorded more than 1,400 murders and 6,200 shootings in 2016 and 2017.

The 2018 murder count through August of 368 marks a 20 percent drop from the 460 killings from January through August last year, the police department said.

For the better part of the last year, Emanuel had said he would run for a third term and had already amassed more than $10 million for the effort, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Obama reacted to Emanuel's announcement by calling him a ""tireless and brilliant public servant.""

""I've been blessed to call Rahm my friend. Whatever he chooses to do next, I know he'll continue to make a positive difference, just as he has throughout his career in public service,"" Obama said, according to WGNTV.com

""And Michelle and I wish Rahm and Amy all the best as they consider this next phase in their lives.""",https://nypost.com/2018/09/04/chicago-mayor-rahm-emanuel-not-seeking-re-election/,"['Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['4', '5', '1', '1', '4']"
3P7RGTLO6FVFCE3TK9XD8S42LMKKA0,"How Maria Butina, accused Russian spy, worked her way into top US circles","Criminal charges open new front in bid to counter Russian disruption and suggest American associates of Butina, 29, may be under threat

The Las Vegas hotel ballroom was crowded, but the Russian redhead caught Donald Trump's eye. ""Yes, ma'am,"" he said, inviting a question.

It was July 2015, and Maria Butina wanted to know what Trump, then a month into his unlikely campaign for the White House, planned to do about US relations with her country. Trump had good news.

""I believe I would get along very nicely with Putin,"" he said.

Butina, then 27, was asked on the sidelines of the event why she had travelled all the way to Nevada for a gathering of libertarians and conservatives. ""I would like to know more, and to bring this knowledge to Russia,"" she said casually. ""I hope it will be useful for my country.""

According to US prosecutors, Butina's patriotic curiosity had by then developed into the beginnings of a criminal conspiracy.

Butina was arrested last weekend and appeared in court in Washington on Monday, charged with operating as a secret agent for the Kremlin. She is accused of working to infiltrate the National Rifle Association (NRA) in an attempt to influence the Republican party and, ultimately, the US government.

An FBI agent who investigated Butina said in a court filing she tried to develop secret back channels with American politicians that could ""penetrate the US national decision-making apparatus to advance the agenda of the Russian federation"".

Butina denies any wrongdoing. Her attorney, Robert Driscoll, said she was a legitimate college graduate and aspiring businesswoman who happened to be Russian. She ""intends to defend her rights vigorously and looks forward to clearing her name"", he said.

The charges open a new front in the justice department's effort to counter Russian disruption of US politics, and signal that American associates of Butina may be seriously imperilled. They also threaten to conclude Butina's short adventure in Washington with up to five years in a federal prison.

As she worked her way into some of American conservatism's most rarefied circles, Butina had a compelling and simple pitch: she was building Russia's equivalent of the NRA.

She spent years cultivating relationships with Republican operatives, gun rights activists and religious leaders. She took photographs with Republican presidential candidates and helped bring NRA officials to Moscow.

In the grey-haired, male-dominated world of conservative conferences, Butina stood out. She was young, tall and flirtatious, according to two gun rights activists who knew her. In 2014, she was the subject of a flattering profile in Russian GQ, accompanied by a photoshoot of her posing with pistols in Dolce &amp; Gabbana underwear.

Butina has said she was raised in Siberia, where her father introduced her to guns and taught her to shoot. After college, she said, she founded a chain of furniture stores. Then she moved to Moscow, where she said she ran an advertising company. In a 2012 profile, she described founding a group called The Right to Bear Arms some time around 2011. She also took the American journalist profiling her to shoot guns ""at a former KGB range"".

Butina clearly knew how to handle firearms: she was comfortable and competent around guns. But other aspects of her rÃ©sumÃ© did not seem to add up, one activist said. When asked for basic official documents for her Russian gun rights group, the activist said, Butina could not produce any.

She did not behave in what I considered an entirely professional manner. She had an extra button or three unbuttoned

Julianne Versnel

Alan Gottlieb and Julianne Versnel, husband-and-wife gun rights activists, said they had an intimate dinner with Butina and Alexander Torshin, her longtime mentor, during a Right to Bear Arms conference in Moscow in 2013. Torshin, a senior official at Russia's central bank, is now accused by US prosecutors of directing Butina's operations.

Gottlieb, founder of the Washington-state based Second Amendment Foundation, said Butina always seemed laser-focused on gun policy. Still, she was an unusual character: assertive, even aggressive and determined to make herself the centre of attention.

""She did not behave in what I considered an entirely professional manner,"" Versnel said. ""She had an extra button or three unbuttoned.""

Her husband added: ""She knew how to use her youth and beauty to make sure that she was engaged in conversation.""

Butina began cultivating American contacts. In 2013, John Bolton, now Trump's national security adviser, appeared in a Russian gun rights video that Right to Bear Arms used for pro-gun lobbying in Russia. Bolton was reportedly asked to appear in the video by David Keene, a recent president of the NRA, who had become acquainted with Torshin.

In April 2014, Butina flew to Indianapolis for the NRA convention. She posted photographs to the Russian social network VK showing that she mixed with Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's pugnacious vice-president, along with heavyweight Republicans including Bobby Jindal, then governor of Louisiana, and Rick Santorum, a former US senator and presidential candidate.

That September, Butina invited Paul Erickson, a conservative political operative and veteran NRA member based in South Dakota, to address her gun rights group in Moscow. Six months later, according to US officials, she emailed an American political operative who appears to be Erickson to set out what she called project ""Diplomacy"". Erickson did not respond to messages this week.

The subject line of Butina's email, sent on 24 March 2015, appeared to liken her to a notorious KGB propagandist during the cold war. In the text, she declared that the Republican party, in the prosecutors' words, ""would likely obtain control over the US government after the 2016 elections"".

The disclosure this week raised an obvious question: what, at a time when most national opinion polling indicated an advantage for Hillary Clinton over her potential Republican rivals, had convinced Butina that the GOP would be triumphant in an election still 20 months away?

Saying that she wanted to build more constructive relations with the traditionally hawkish Republicans, Butina noted the NRA's ""central place and influence"" in the party. She said she needed a $125,000 budget to fund her participation in GOP conferences. The American political operative provided her with a list of ""important contacts"" to meet.

A few weeks later, Butina was back in the US for the NRA's 2015 convention. Held in Nashville, Tennessee, it again gave her access to the most in-demand figures in the conservative movement. She and Torshin chatted with Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, who posed for a photograph with her and spoke a few phrases in Russian. In July, Butina attended the launch of Walker's presidential campaign.

The Kremlin seems to have been interested. Court filings said Butina wrote Torshin a memo about a political campaign event that detailed her ""private meeting"" with the same candidate at the NRA convention. Walker was not identified by name. Then came Butina's encounter with Trump at the Freedom Fest event in Las Vegas.

Late that year, Butina's gun rights group paid to fly NRA allies to Moscow for a visit that included lavish dinners and a meeting with Dmitry Rogozin, Russia's deputy prime minister. Her guests included Erickson, Keene and David Clarke, the former sheriff of Milwaukee, who would go on to support Trump's presidential campaign.

Pete Brownell, a gun company chief executive who also took part in the 2015 Moscow trip, became NRA president in 2017. In May this year, his tenure ended abruptly and earlier than expected. Representatives did not respond to questions about whether his departure was connected to the Russia trip.

The NRA and Clarke did not respond to requests for comment. A person who answered the phone at a number listed under Keene's name said on Monday he was ""out fishing"" and was not expected back until the end of the month.

As the 2016 campaign intensified, and the likelihood of Trump's Republican primary victory became clear, Butina began honing her activities and trying to gain access to the candidate and his circle, according to US officials.

During that election year, she obtained a student visa and enrolled in an international relations graduate program at American University in Washington. But her networking continued.

Butina told a second American associate, also unidentified in the charging documents, that a Kremlin official had endorsed her efforts to establish a back channel to US politicians. She wrote: ""All we needed is &lt; &gt; from Putin's side. The rest is easier.""

Court filings describe extensive efforts by Butina and Torshin over the following months to arrange a series of ""friendship and dialogue dinners"" in Washington and New York. They reportedly used American go-betweens to make an apparently unsuccessful approach to senior members of Trump's campaign with a ""backdoor overture"" on behalf of Vladimir Putin's government.

They tried to get access to Trump himself in May 2016, but had to make do with his son. The Trump Organization confirmed that Donald Jr met Torshin during the NRA convention in Louisville, Kentucky, but tried to downplay the significance of their discussion.

Alan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump company, told CBS the two men were introduced and ""made small talk for a few minutes"" before dining separately. Futerfas has also said the discussion was ""all gun-related"". The New York Times reported on Monday that Butina was present at this meeting and that congressional investigators have obtained a photograph of the three together.

According to the FBI, when guns didn't bring her to Trump, Butina tried again with God. An investigator described in court filings a series of contacts between Butina and an organiser for the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. Butina and Torshin attended in February 2016.

(Torshin and Butina came even closer to a meeting with the president at the following year's Prayer Breakfast. Shortly before the scheduled encounter, a White House aide flagged Torshin's ""baggage"" and cancelled the meet and greets, Yahoo News reported.)

By 4 October 2016, with just a month to go before polling day, Butina's first American associate - apparently Erickson - emailed a contact to say that he had ""been involved in securing a VERY private line of communication between the Kremlin"" and Republican leaders.

The next day, Butina and Torshin exchanged a series of cryptic Twitter messages reflecting on their efforts, according to prosecutors. When Torshin asked about the status of the ""Russia-USA friendship society"", Butina replied ""we are currently 'underground' both here and there"" and signalled a need to avoid publicity.

3AXFSPQOYRGFXLEJD4JTLEFG3QPFJR,NRA Gives '16 Million Reasons' Feinstein Is Wrong by Saying Semi-Automatic Weapons Aren't in 'Common Use',"The NRA is making sure to keep Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) accountable for comments she made while questioning Judge Brett Kavanaugh.

During the Supreme Court nominee's confirmation hearing, Feinstein brought up the idea of common use weapons.

""I'm talking about your statement on 'common use,'"" Feinstein said. ""Assault weapons are not in common use.""

Kavanaugh claimed that semi-automatic weapons were in common use based on how many Americans owned the weapon, yet Feinstein expressed her fear that this would cause bigger problems.

""If the Supreme Court were to adopt your reasoning,"" Feinstein said. ""I fear the number of victims would continue to grow.""

According to Kavanaugh, millions of Americans own weapons such as the AR-15.

""Semi-automatic rifles are widely possessed in the United States,"" Kavanaugh rebutted. ""There are millions and millions. ... That seemed to fit the [definition of] 'common use' and not being a dangerous and unusual weapon.""

The NRA is now also backing his claims, releasing a study that shows over 16 million rifles were currently in America.

""We now have more than 16 million reasons to disagree with her,"" the NRA-ILA wrote in an article. ""Needless to say, there is nothing 'reasonable' or moderate about banning what is literally the most popular class of rifles in America.""

37J05LC5AY1IZ10NMYO3XECVRR5DJ2,Betsy DeVos considers allowing schools to use federal funds to buy guns,"

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

This story has been updated.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is considering whether states can use federal grant money to buy guns for schools, including possibly arming teachers, after receiving queries from Texas and Oklahoma, people familiar with the matter said.

The idea drew swift criticism from Democrats, teacher unions, education groups and gun control activists, who said the response to school shootings should be fewer guns, not more. But President Trump and others have argued that arming teachers would â€œhardenâ€ schools and make them less likely targets for mass shootings.

Texas and Oklahoma were seeking clarity on spending funds from Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants, which can be used for a wide range of school expenses.

Some opponents said firearms were never considered when the grants were created in 2015. But the $1.1 billion program has few restrictions on it, and some argued DeVos may have little choice but to give states the flexibility that Congress wrote into the law.

â€œCongress wrote a vague law and everyone is trying to figure out what it means,â€ an administration official said. This person added that Congress should bar such purchases if it does not want to allow them.

The education department has never before funded gun purchases. Earlier this year, in the wake of the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., Congress allocated $50 million per year for a school safety grant program, which specifically banned the use of funds to train or provide school staff with firearms.

Officials cautioned that it is possible DeVos would take no action on this matter â€” not expressly permitting the gun purchases, nor advising against it. An education department spokeswoman declined to say how DeVos sees the matter.

â€œThe department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety,â€ said spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill. â€œThe secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios.â€

Some read the move by Texas and Oklahoma as an effort to force DeVosâ€™s hand on an issue she would rather not confront. Even if she doesnâ€™t want to approve firearm purchases, they said, the rules of the program may leave her little choice.

â€œThey are uncomfortable with the substance but they feel like they donâ€™t have a choice,â€ said one Republican who is close to the agency and who spoke with officials there about this on Thursday. â€œTheyâ€™re getting jammed by Texas and Oklahoma.â€

[â€˜No way I would do thatâ€™: Educators decry Trump proposal to arm teachers]

Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who chairs the Senate education committee, said DeVos may have to allow the purchases even if she doesnâ€™t want to.

â€œIâ€™m not a fan of arming teachers, but the safe schools block grant for many years has allowed states to make the decision about how to use those federal dollars to make schools safer for children,â€ he said, using an earlier name for the grant program at issue.

Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the committee, vowed to fight the idea. â€œUsing these funds to add more firearms into schools is not only the opposite of what Congress intended, it is wrong and will make schools more dangerous and students less safe,â€ she said.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a leading voice for new gun restrictions, introduced an amendment to a spending bill pending in the Senate to block the idea. The bill passed without a vote on his measure.

The conversation about using federal funds for guns appears to be unfolding independently from deliberations of a school safety commission created by President Trump that is led by DeVos. The commission is expected to include a section in its report on best practices for arming school personnel, several people familiar with that process aid.

[At Betsy DeVosâ€™s federal school safety commission meeting, lessons from first-graders on friendships and fist bumps]

During its public meetings, the commission has heard strong arguments on both sides about guns in schools. The commissionâ€™s last field visit is set for Thursday in Las Vegas, with a final â€œlistening sessionâ€ planned for next week.

The question about use of the federal grant program, known as Title IV, was posed by the Texas Education Agency, which wanted clarity on how it can use the grant funding, according to federal and state officials. The stateâ€™s questions included whether Texas could use the funding to arm and train school marshals, who are sometimes teachers, as well as other school security measures, according to an email sent to the federal department by a Texas official.

DeEtta Culbertson, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, said the question originated from a regional school official and that the state forwarded it to Washington seeking clarity.

A request for clarification also came from an Oklahoma school district, a department official said.

Opponents said that funding gun purchases would mean pulling funding for mental health and other programs.

â€œDevos, after my daughter was murdered, you yelled â€˜Donâ€™t talk about guns, talk about mental health,'â€ Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., wrote on Twitter. â€œYour brain dead plan will pull money from mental health.â€

Superintent Craig McVay, who heads the El Reno Public Schools system outside of Oklahoma City, said he would never spend the districtâ€™s grant money on guns. The cash-strapped district received $46,000 through the program last year and spent it on reading and math software for its grade school students.

â€œWeâ€™re probably going to find a different way to keep kids safe rather than spend money weâ€™ve traditionally used on academic achievement,â€ McVay said.

In rural Lee County, Va., school leaders recently voted to arm school employees, saying it was cheaper than hiring school resource officers or armed law enforcement personnel. School board chairman Mike Kidwell said he favored using grant money for guns.

â€œItâ€™s a cheap way to add security to our schools and the best option we could do,â€ he said of arming teachers. â€œAny state or federal funds, in my opinion, that could go toward arming someone like this is money well spent.â€

Trump has repeatedly called for arming teachers as a response to the rash of mass shootings at schools. In February, he suggested paying teachers a bonus if they agree to carry weapons. At a Cabinet meeting last week, he said, â€œWe want to harden our schools against attack.â€ Among the solutions, he said, was â€œallowing qualified personnel to be armed.â€

At that meeting, DeVos did not endorse that idea, but she said decisions about the safety of students rests primarily with states and local communities. â€œOur aim isnâ€™t to impose a one-size-fits-all solution for everyone, everywhere,â€ she said.

2Q Fundraising

It's that time again! The deadline for House and Senate candidates to file their quarterly fundraising reports (covering the period from April 1 to June 30) is July 15, but it's common for campaigns to leak their numbers early to generate some press. (Deadlines vary by state for gubernatorial contenders and often aren't quarterly.) We'll be posting numbers as we get them; as always, we'll be releasing our House fundraising chart after the July 15 deadline.

And as we always urge campaigns every quarter, if you want to get attention for your most recent fundraising haul, issue a release now. Don't wait until the reporting deadline, when everyone's numbers come out at once.

â— CA-04: Jessica Morse (D): $520,000 raised

â— CA-39: Gil Cisneros (D) $479,000 raised; $715,000 cash-on-hand

â— FL-16: Vern Buchanan (R-inc): $640,000 raised, $2.5 million cash-on-hand

â— IL-06: Sean Casten (D): $790,000 raised

â— OH-01: Aftab Pureval (D): $885,000 raised, $1 million cash-on-hand

â— TX-07: Lizzie Pannill Fletcher (D): $1 million raised, $800,000 cash-on-hand

Senate

â— AZ-Sen: DefendArizona, a super PAC that's aligned with the Republican Party establishment, has reserved $5 million in TV ad time for the general election in Arizona on the hope that Rep. Martha McSally, the national GOP's favorite, wins the Aug. 28 primary.

â— FL-Sen: The group New Republican PAC (guess what party they support) has thrown down another $771,000 against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, which takes their total investment in this race to $5.3 million so far.

â— MI-Sen: Wealthy venture capitalist Sandy Pensler has released a Strategic National poll that gives him a 33-18 edge in the GOP primary against businessman John James. Pensler has led every poll here for months, though this internal survey was released about a day after an independent poll from Target-Insyght found him with a much narrower 32-29 advantage in the August primary.

â— ND-Sen: Senate Majority PAC has put $93,000 behind their latest ad against Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer. They bemoan what they call his false attacks against Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, while accusing him of lying about his own record. SMP also blasts Cramer for increasing the deficit by $1.9 trillion dollars and proposing to cut Medicare and Social Security to pay for it.

â— TN-Sen: Former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen's latest ad focuses on Supreme Court justices, where he decries how partisan the confirmation battles have become and says he'll vote on a nominee based solely on whether they're highly qualified and ethical.

â— WV-Sen: Senate Majority PAC has laid down another $466,000 to bash Republican Patrick Morrisey in West Virginia. Their latest TV ad uses a CBS news clip where Morrisey admits he lobbied for pharmaceutical companies. They follow up by accusing him of getting rich lobbying for opioid distributors and then going so easy on them when he became state attorney general that the Charleston Gazette-Mail called his handling of the opioid crisis ""woefully negligent.""

â— Senate: The Senate Leadership Fund, which is the main super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the GOP establishment, has made another round of TV ad reservations on behalf of three red-state Republicans:

IN-Sen: Mike Braun: $7.1 million TN-Sen: Marsha Blackburn: $4.2 million WV-Sen: Patrick Morrisey: $5 million

Indiana and West Virginia feature two vulnerable Democratic incumbents, Joe Donnelly and Joe Manchin, respectively. However, Tennessee's inclusion raises an eyebrow, since it's a Republican-held open seat in a state that backed Trump by a wide 61-35 margin. Nevertheless, reservations can be canceled if conditions change, and SLF will almost certainly expand the amounts it is spending as Election Day grows nearer.

Gubernatorial

â— AK-Gov: On Monday, wealthy businessman Scott Hawkins announced that he was dropping out of the Aug. 21 GOP primary. Hawkins said he'd been planning for a one-on-one contest against former state Sen. Mike Dunleavy, but former Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell's last-minute entry ""significantly complicated this contrast.""

The only poll we've seen of this primary was an early June survey for Dunleavy's allied Dunleavy for Alaska PAC that showed him far ahead with 46 percent of the vote, while Treadwell and Hawkins took 19 and 7 percent, respectively. Hawkins said a poll he'd conducted a month ago but didnâ€™t release also found both him and Treadwell trailing Dunleavy by quite a bit.

â— AZ-Gov: The GOP firm Data Orbital takes a look at the Aug. 28 Democratic primary to take on GOP Gov. Doug Ducey, and they give Arizona State University professor David Garcia a 33-11 lead over state Sen. Steve Farley; activist Kelly Fryer takes third with 6 percent. The only other poll we've seen in months was a May Garcia internal that gave him the lead with 32 percent, while Farley and Fryer each took 11.

â— CO-Gov: Following last week's primary, which set up a November matchup in Colorado's open gubernatorial race between Democratic Rep. Jared Polis and Republican state Treasurer Walker Stapleton, the Colorado Democratic Party quickly released a new poll from PPP showing Polis up 47-40 and Donald Trump under water with a 44-52 job approval rating. Notably, neither Stapleton nor his allies have responded with contradictory data in the week since the poll came out, and a poll last month that also had Polis ahead likewise went unanswered.

While we always caution against reading too much into a single survey or even a pair of them, a number of other factors bode poorly for Stapleton. Though both parties hosted competitive primaries, far more votes were cast on the Democratic side than in the Republican contest: 629,000 to 498,000, a 56-44 differential on a percentage basis. In addition, independent voters were allowed to participate in party primaries for the first time, and more of them cast ballots for Democratic candidates than for Republicans.

Colorado is also the second most highly educated state in the nation (40 percent of residents hold a bachelor's degree or higher) and 12th-most affluent, and it's home to a large and growing Latino population (21 percent, the seventh-largest overall). These are demographics that have proven sharply hostile to Trump's GOP.

The main dynamic in Stapleton's favor is likely the fact that Democrats have held the governorship for 12 straight years. But if Coloradans have tired of the Democratic Party occupying the governor's mansion, they have yet to show it. Polis, a wealthy self-funder who's worth as much as $400 million, will have all the resources he needs from now until Election Day, and it looks like he has the edge. We're therefore changing our rating on this race from Tossup to Lean Democratic.

â— CT-Gov: Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton, who has the state GOP endorsement, is up with his first major TV buy ahead of the Aug. 14 primary, which the campaign says its running ""in excess of six-figures"". Boughton begins by discussing a recent health scare, with him telling the audience, ""A neurologist discovered a large mass inside my brain,"" and that he ""was told there was a chance I would never walk or talk again.""

As footage of a surgeon at work plays, Boughton says he ""went to the best surgeon in the world and with god's grace and his steady hands, the operation was a complete success."" He concludes by saying that he wants ""to give my time and voice to give Connecticut its own comeback story and to change our future and to turn our state around.""

Boughton had the aforementioned surgery last year, but a few months ago, he collapsed due to what he said was ""severe"" dehydration and his failure to take anti-seizure medication. Boughton says that ""[o]ther candidates have mentioned"" his health, and that this commercial is his attempt to tackle the issue head on rather than shy away from it.

Boughton didn't name which of the â€œother candidatesâ€ he was talking about, but the Connecticut Post notes that Trumbull First Selectman Tim Herbst has repeatedly boosted about his own ""physical stamina,"" and bragged that he does CrossFit workouts. Herbst underwent a successful operation last year to remove a cancerous thyroid, but he's declared that he's in excellent health and argues he's the best-positioned candidate in the five-way GOP primary to survive a ""grueling campaign.""

On the Democratic side, Rep. John Larson has endorsed businessman Ned Lamont.

â— GA-Gov: Secretary of State Brian Kemp is out with a poll of the July 24 GOP primary runoff from Public Opinion Strategies that shows him tied 45-45 with Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle. The results are almost identical to the 44-43 Cagle edge that the GOP firm Cygnal, which says they're neutral in the contest, also found in late June.

â— IL-Gov: The Economic Freedom Alliance, which was headed by wealthy businessman Ron Gidwitz until he was nominated to become ambassador to Belgium in May, has dropped $500,000 on TV ads for Republican Gov.

â— MI-Gov: Last week, GOP Attorney General Bill Schuette's allied super PAC Better Jobs Stronger Families PAC released a poll from NMB Research that showed him narrowly trailing Democratic frontrunner Gretchen Whitmer 40-39 and tied with businessman Shri Thanedar 40-40. The memo says that both matchups include another 20 percent or respondents ""leaning or undecided,"" but they don't reveal which way the leaners are well, leaning.

The only other recent poll we've seen here was a Target-Insyght poll for the local tipsheet MIRS News that found Schuette trailing Whitmer and Thanedar 42-37 and 40-37, respectively. (Neither poll has results testing Schuette against the third Democratic candidate, former Detroit Health Commissioner Abdul El-Sayed.)

P.S. The NMB poll also included a look at the Aug. 7 GOP primary. However, the PAC has not responded to our inquiries about the poll's sample size, which is information we need to include a poll in the Digest.

Meanwhile, Thanedar's latest Democratic primary ad takes on Donald Trump, with Thanedar highlighting his immigrant background as a success story contrary to Trump's claims that immigrants are part of ""an infestation."" He says he'll fight for early childhood education, criminal justice reform, and keeping ""Trump's racism"" out of Michigan.

â— KS-02: A new group called Kansans Can Do Anything PAC is spending $64,000 on an ad campaign for Army veteran Steve Watkins ahead of the Aug. 7 GOP primary. While the super PAC's name is reminiscent of then-Louisiana Gov.

This Detroit-based seat backed Clinton 79-18, so Conyers III's campaign probably isn't going to leave many Democrats sweating about the general election. Conyers III has until July 19 to submit 3,000 valid signatures, which is three times the number he needed to qualify for the Democratic primary.

â— NY-23: Cyber security expert Tracy Mitrano emerged as the Democratic nominee to take on GOP Rep. Tom Reed on Tuesday after veteran Max Della Pia conceded defeat a week after their tight June 26 primary. This district, which includes liberal Ithaca and conservative neighboring areas, has been a big source of frustration for Democrats over the last few cycles. Reed pulled off a surprisingly close 52-48 win in 2012 as Romney was carrying his upstate seat 50-48, but he did considerably better against touted Democratic foes during the 2014 Republican wave and in 2016, when Trump won the seat 55-40.

Neither national party has shown much interest this time and Daily Kos Elections rates this contest as Safe Republican. However, after what happened in 2012, this seat is at least worth keeping an eye on.

The narrator begins by accusing Chabot of not showing up for a real town hall and proceeds to feature several people asking their questions to an empty podium. They proceed to ask why Chabot voted to cut taxes for the ultra-wealthy even though they'll go up for most other people.

On the other side, the American Chemistry Council is out with an issue ad that praises Chabot for pushing ""middle class tax cuts,"" and says the former teacher is pushing for bipartisan solutions to end school violence; there is no word on the size of the buy.

â— OH-04: Just before the Independence Day holiday, NBC News reported that Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, who was an assistant wrestling coach at the Ohio State University from 1986 to 1994, had been accused of willfully ignoring widespread sexual abuse allegedly committed by Dr. Richard Strauss, the team's doctor from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s. Several former wrestlers came forward with their allegations this spring, and the university launched an investigation in April into their claims that coaches and other OSU employees knew of Strauss' predatory behavior, something Jordan unequivocally denies.

Three former wrestlers discussed their claims of abuse with NBC, and two of them, Mike DiSabato and Dunyasha Yetts, went public with their identities. Both said it was widely known that Strauss was a predator who frequently groped athletes during examinations and would take long showers with students during which he would masturbate in front of them.

None of the former wrestlers has accused Jordan of sexual abuse, and they've spoken highly of him as a coach and mentor, but DiSabato and Yetts called Jordan a ""liar"" for pleading ignorance about the accusations against Struass. Yetts says he personally told Jordan about an incident where Strauss tried to pull down his pants when he went to see him for a thumb injury.

DiSabato estimates that Strauss, who also served as a physician for other sports teams, abused 1,500 to 2,000 athletes over two decades. The university itself confirms ""reports of sexual misconduct"" from former athletes in 14 different sports, as well as from former patients at the school's Student Health Services department, where Strauss also worked. DiSaboto says that the recent conviction of Michigan State University sports physician Larry Nassar inspired him and other athletes to speak out about Strauss, who committed suicide in 2005.

After NBC's story broke, a spokesperson for Jordan denied the congressman knew of the abuse and claimed he hadn't been contacted by investigators but would cooperate with them. However, the law firm appointed as legal counsel to OSU told NBC it had previously tried to reach Jordan by email and phone for an interview yet received no response.

While several members of the House have resigned over the last year in response to claims of sexual harassment and misconduct, none have been as powerful as Jordan, a founding member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus and one of the leading conservative extremists in Congress. Jordan hasn't yet faced widespread calls to resign, but that may change as more details emerge.

O'Rourke is the Democrat nominee facing Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in one of the closest races in the country.

O'Rourke sat down for an interview with CBS and explained his full view on the Second Amendment, including his belief that Americans should not be able to own AR-15s.

""I think banning bump stocks makes a lot of sense. As I just shared, I don't know that we should raise the age for buying an AR-15, I just don't think that we should be selling AR-15s in this country. That weapon was designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to kill people as effectively and efficiently as possible on the battlefield. It has no place in our streets, in our schools, in our concerts, and movie theaters. We should not be selling that to civilians.""

O'Rourke also touched on school safety, specifically on arming teachers in the classroom.

""I've been listening to teachers in Texas and they want to focus on teaching the kids in their classrooms, not carrying weapons,"" explained O'Rourke.

""I think that securing the school, making sure all doors are locked and locked from the inside, I think restricting entrance and exits, all those things make a lot more sense in addition to getting smart on gun safety, universal background checks, banning the sale of assault weapons, and allowing the CDC to study gun violence in this country.""

Many were not thrilled to hear O'Rourke talk about banning certain guns, especially when he referred to ""assault weapons.""

Many fear the slippery slope that follows banning guns like AR-15s because there are very minimal differences between the AR-15 and most weapons in this country, rendering the Second Amendment at risk.

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education have been threatened with lawsuits over a plan to arm teachers that hasn't even been confirmed by anyone on the record, The Hill reported.

The New York Times cited ""multiple people with knowledge of the plan"" when reporting Wednesday that DeVos was considering allowing states to use federal funding to buy guns for teachers.

In response, the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the American Federation of Teachers, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Democracy Forward came together to say they may sue if that plan goes forward.

""We will fight this unlawful proposal to spend taxpayer dollars on guns for our kids' classrooms every step of the way,"" the press release read.

For a long time, the federal government has refused to pay for weapons for schools, and Congress expressly forbid money in a recent school safety bill from being used on guns.

According to the Times, a program called the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants doesn't prohibit weapons purchases, meaning the federal government could potentially choose to use that as a vehicle to pay for guns for school personnel.

The Education Department did not confirm or deny its consideration of such a proposal, saying ""The secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios.""

The coalition of groups harshly criticized the proposal, calling it reckless and saying it would only make schools less safe.

""We knew Betsy DeVos wanted to gut and privatize public education, but her decision to consider turning the federal government into an arms dealer for schools goes far beyond the recklessness we thought she was capable of,"" said Randi Weingten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""Flooding schools with guns will make kids and teachers less, not more, safe.

Other members of the coalition claimed it to be unwise to use federal money on guns when many schools come up short with basic school supplies.

""It is outrageous to think of using federal funds to buy guns for teachers at a time when underfunded schools can't even afford school supplies,"" said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/08/24/arms-dealer-for-schools-groups-threaten-devos-with-lawsuit-over-alleged-plan-to-arm-teachers,"['Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Democratic']","['5', '5', '1', '5', '5']"

In Cody Wilson's zeal to post his plastic-gun blueprints online, he's actually exposing a giant loophole in gun control: Our view

A 3D-printed gun (Photo: Eric Gay/AP)

America is already awash in 270 million firearms, more than one for every adult in the nation. Now it's possible to assemble a pistol from parts created on a three-dimensional printer. For those worried about gun proliferation in an era of mass shootings and terrorism, is it time to panic?

Not yet.

Cranking out weaponry on a 3D printer, as readily as printing tax forms on your HP inkjet, remains futuristic. Arms-producing printer technology is expensive, time-consuming and rudimentary. Today's plastic guns are odd, boxy creations that tend to crack or come apart when the first shot is fired. Traditional metal weapons, responsible for this weekend's carnage in Chicago, are a much bigger concern.

Even so, if there's one thing we've learned about technology it's that it will improve rapidly. The time to address the threats posed by self-made guns is before, not after, they become a major problem.

CODY WILSON: My printable guns respect security norms

Adding a certain amount of urgency to the issue is 30-year-old Cody Wilson, a Second Amendment champion and self-styled anarchist from Texas who seeks to post his plastic-gun blueprints online.

The internet unveiling was temporarily blocked by judges last week after eight states and the District of Columbia filed suit, arguing that the technology allows criminals and terrorists to build untraceable and undetectable firearms.

Wilson conceded as much on Fox News Sunday: ""It should be expected that there will be social costs for protecting a right.""

The blueprint genie might be out of the bottle already. Wilson's plans were downloaded more than 100,000 times before being pulled and are readily available elsewhere. But he has achieved something else, however unintended. In his zeal to promote firearms, Wilson shed a bright light on a giant loophole in gun laws.

The requirement to undergo a criminal and mental-health background check before purchasing a serialized and traceable firearm applies only to guns bought from commercially licensed dealers, the way most people acquire them. But if you can build one in your basement â€” or assemble it from printed parts â€” no background check or serialization is necessary.

That used to be the realm of hobbyists fascinated by historic flintlocks. No more. Now, companies are selling kits from which untraceable assault-style rifles can be assembled. They're called ""ghost guns,"" and their popularity is growing.

A disturbed and angry Kevin Janson Neal of Northern California was barred by court order from owning firearms, but he managed to assemble two high-powered rifles, killed his wife and four others, and shot up an elementary school before police killed him in November. Earlier this year, law enforcement in Los Angeles seized from gang members a small arsenal of guns, including AR-15 assault-style rifles, built from internet-ordered parts.

""You should have made a law,"" Wilson said of this lack of restrictions.

An excellent idea. California did just that in 2016, requiring people who assemble homemade guns â€” be they metal or plastic â€” to apply for a serial number and submit to a background check. True, lawbreakers are unlikely to comply, but they'll certainly risk arrest or seizure of their guns should police stop them on the street.

As 3D printer technology advances, closing this loophole is one good way to get ahead of the problem of unlicensed, untraceable guns. Another way might be using technology, such as blocking software, to prevent the printers from being used to make firearms. To the extent that Cody Wilson spurs actions such as these, he's providing a valuable public service.

3EHVO81VN63SG0PLI51NKZV7PXB1HY,Chicago hopes therapy in jail can slow gun violence,"CLOSE Chicago ended 2017 with fewer homicides than the year before, but gang violence in the cityâ€™s most dangerous neighborhoods kept the total number of killings above the 600 mark for only the second time in more than a decade. Time

Jail officials are betting the program can help reduce gun violence in Chicago. (Photo: Aamer Madhani, USA TODAY)

CHICAGO â€“ The day's group therapy session for the young detainees at the county jail started with their behavioral health specialist testing them with a hypothetical scenario: Theyâ€™ve cheated on a girlfriend and the other woman is pregnant.

The participants â€“ all facing serious charges and picked for the jail's intensive therapy program because they're deemed a high risk of getting caught in Chicagoâ€™s intractable gun violence once they leave custody â€“ bristled at a push for honest talk.

â€œAm I ready to take this journey?â€ asked Timothy Moore, the counselor, who told the detainees the question was as relevant to addressing their lives on Chicagoâ€™s streets as it was to navigating their relationships. â€œAm I ready to listen? Am I ready to be honest? Thatâ€™s what counts. Thatâ€™s the first step.â€

And the Cook County Sheriffâ€™s Office initiative dubbed S.A.V.E. â€“ an anti-violence program built around trying to change how incarcerated men from some of Chicago's most volatile neighborhoods think â€“ was off and running.

Programs like S.A.V.E. (the Sheriff's Anti-Violence Effort) that use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a psychological treatment that focuses on helping young men recognize their instinctual responses and slow down their thinking in high-stake situations, have gained popularity in several cities around the U.S. in recent years.

The sheriff's office, which runs one of the nationâ€™s biggest jails, is betting that the therapy can help some of Chicago's incarcerated population get a better handle on their impulses â€“ and in the process, reduce the cityâ€™s persistent gun violence.

Many participants will likely find themselves jailed again: 43 percent of Illinois offenders are charged within three years of being released from incarceration, according to the state's sentencing policy advisory council.

But sheriff's officials say if they can help the young men â€“ who come from one of Chicago's 15 most-violent ZIP codes â€“ even slightly shift their decision-making capabilities, the impact for the individuals and their communities will be significant. Participants attend therapy and life skills classes five days a week.

Tom Dart, the Cook County sheriff, said he told his staff that the program's objective is met if a participant after his release â€œdidnâ€™t shoot anybody and wasnâ€™t shot by anybody.â€

â€œThose were my two bars for success,â€ Dart said.

Therapy gains in popularity

The 2-year-old program at Cook County Jail in Chicago was launched as the nationâ€™s third-largest city saw gun violence skyrocket in 2016 and 2017 with more than 1,400 murders and 6,200 shootings as the national murder rate hovered near all-time lows.

Murders are down 20 percent in 2018 compared with the same time last year, but the city is once again on track to lead the nation in homicides.

Experts say cognitive behavioral therapy has proved to be an effective tool in fighting the plague of gun violence in several different settings.

In Boston and Baltimore, the anti-violence group ROCA Inc. has used CBT in its work with ex-offenders, a program that pushes the riskiest of at-risk to ""think different to act different."" In the group's work in the Boston area, 84 percent of its participants have no new arrests, and two out of three stay employed after finishing the program.

Researchers at the University of Chicago Crime Lab found that participants in the urban youth mentoring program Becoming a Man, which focuses on Chicagoâ€™s at-risk teenagers and utilizes CBT, tallied a 50 percent lower violent crime rate than their peers.

And last year, the anti-poverty group Heartland Alliance launched a two-year, $32 million program called READI Chicago that provides CBT and transitional jobs to ex-offenders convicted of violent crimes.

The participants, who are recruited from three of Chicagoâ€™s most violent neighborhoods, attend group therapy sessions or life-skills coaching each weekday morning before heading to hourly-paid jobs.

Eddie Bocanegra, READI Chicagoâ€™s senior director, said about half of participants were hostile to outreach workersâ€™ initial efforts to recruit them. About 68 percent of 328 participants READI Chicago has placed in jobs are still working and attending the group therapy and coaching sessions, according to the group.

â€œThey are disconnected for a certain reason, theyâ€™re involved in violence and victimization for a certain reason ... so itâ€™s important for this population we recognize their challenges and that we recognize what itâ€™s going to take to engage this population,"" he said.

Desman Donaldson, 23, who joined READI Chicago last year while on probation for aggravated battery of a police officer, said pairing therapy with work has been crucial to helping him change.

Heâ€™s now charting out a plan to get a commercial driver's license so he can work as a trucker. Eventually, Donaldson wants to pursue a career in real estate.

The $12-per-hour READI job provides him a fraction of what he said he made dealing drugs. Still, the income helps keep him out of trouble.

â€œIâ€™m definitely thinking about the long term,"" said Donaldson, who has been arrested 13 times since he turned 11. ""The way I was going â€” all my people were getting federal indictments.â€

Throw out the rule books

The Cook County Jailâ€™s S.A.V.E. program is unique to other programs using therapy as a violence prevention tool in that it works with offenders while they are still incarcerated.

The jail program enrolls about 40 young male detainees at a time and houses them together at a division of the sprawling jail as they wait for their cases to wind through the county court or until they can be released on bond. The sheriff's office, which has two jail staffers who work full time on S.A.V.E. and six others who work part time, said it costs about $285,000 annually to operate.

The participants all volunteer for the program and must express a desire to make sweeping changes in their lives.

Many come from rival gangs but agree to set aside differences they might have on the street to take part in the program. Typically, administrators at the jail try to segregate gang rivals.

â€œYou throw a little bit of the rule book out the window,â€ Dart said. â€œIf you go on our S.A.V.E. tier, there are people, who if theyâ€™re on the outside right now, are shooting at each other.â€

Only a fraction of detainees who started the program stick with it long term.

The sheriff's office said it is still working with or in touch with 98 of the 679 participants who opted into S.A.V.E. since its launch. The participants include several who were in S.A.V.E. for a matter of days.

More than 200 of the participants were expelled for fighting, repeated disrespect of S.A.V.E. officials or other unspecified infractions, according to sheriff's office data. Eighty-four participants opted out while they were still jailed and were returned to the general population.

After S.A.V.E participants leave jail, the sheriffâ€™s department steers them to anti-violence groups on the outside that offer services such as job training and continued therapy. It ultimately is up to participants to follow through.

The participants are facing a gamut of serious charges but are likely to spend all or most of their incarcerated time in the county jail. About 81 percent of Cook County detainees are returned directly to their communities without entering the state prison system.

Success and failure

In the early going for S.A.V.E., there have been hits and misses.

Randy Leflore, 21, spent about seven months in S.A.V.E. before a judge agreed to release him on electronic monitoring in June 2017 while he awaits trial.

Leflore, a former gang member, ended up in jail after allegedly carrying out three armed robberies of laundromats. He was also in possession of a replica firearm when he was arrested, according to prosecutors.

Leflore pleaded not guilty to the charges but acknowledges he was in a bad place when he was arrested. He credits S.A.V.E. with helping him restart his life.

â€œThe important thing I got out of S.A.V.E. was to change the way I think,â€ said Leflore, who has been working part-time jobs at McDonald's and Corner Bakery restaurants since his release from jail. â€œBasically, it was like I had a criminal mindset. I thought there ainâ€™t no way I could change.â€

Leflore said he recently used what he learned in therapy after one of his gang buddies was fatally shot by a rival in their neighborhood, Englewood, an enclave on the cityâ€™s South Side hard hit by gun violence.

â€œWhen someone dies in Englewood â€¦ the first thing that comes to mind is retaliation,â€ Leflore said. â€œWhen things like that happen now I just sit.""

Not all S.A.V.E. participants have managed to avoid gun violence after getting out.

Courtney Lewis, 20, spent fewer than 40 days in S.A.V.E. in late 2016 and early 2017 after being charged with unlawful use of a weapon and felony possession of a firearm after police officers found a gun on him following a traffic stop. Lewis was prohibited from possessing a firearm because of a previous gun-related conviction.

In January 2017, a relative posted the $7,500 Lewis needed to bond out of jail. He returned home while his case plodded along in the county court system, court records show.

Less than three months after his release, Lewis was shot and another man was wounded when a gunman opened fire on the vehicle they were riding in, police said. In addition to those killed, seven former participants â€“ including four who were expelled from S.A.V.E. â€“ ended up back in jail on charges related to discharging a firearm, according to the Sheriffâ€™s Office.

Lewis died from his wounds several days after the incident and became one of three S.A.V.E. participants killed in gun violence after leaving the program.

Lewis spoke regularly with S.A.V.E. officials at least for part of the time he was out on bail, but he eventually fell out of touch and was listed as inactive in the program three days before he was gunned down, according to sheriff's records.

â€œThat was big on the whole S.A.V.E. program,"" said Leflore, who knew Lewis before they spent time in S.A.V.E. together. ""I think a lot of participants learned a lesson from Courtney Lewis â€¦ to stay out of the streets.â€

Other S.A.V.E. participants say their efforts to reform are similar to a drug addict or alcoholic trying to get sober in that relapse is often a pitfall in the path toward recovery.

Romell Young, 23, who is back in jail after being arrested on an unlawful use of weapon charge, started his third stint in the S.A.V.E. program in late May. His two earlier stints were after arrests for drug possession charges.

For the first weeks of his current jail stay, Young needed to use a cane to walk. He was seriously wounded the month before he was arrested after he said he beat up a man in a fistfight near his home.

Weeks after being shot, police said they received a call from a concerned resident about an armed man on the street fitting Youngâ€™s description.

When police arrived, Young allegedly tried to flee and during a brief pursuit threw his jacket, according to court records. The responding officer discovered a firearm in the area near where Young allegedly threw the coat.

Through S.A.V.E.'s individual counseling, he said heâ€™s come to realize that heâ€™s never fully dealt with parental abandonment issues from his childhood. The therapy sessions, he said, have also taught him coping techniques to deal with adversity, and he has a better grip on his anger.

So why does he keep putting himself in dangerous situations?

â€œI need someone to stand on me,â€ Young said. â€œIf this program could be outside in the world, it would be better for us.â€

Recently, he felt like he hit bottom. On Fatherâ€™s Day, his mother brought his 9-month-old son to the jail to visit him. His child wanted to touch him, but a glass divider in the jailâ€™s visiting room made it impossible.

â€œHe started busting out crying,â€ Young recalled. â€œThat was the moment I realized, and I prayed about it. Only thing I can do now is beat the path to righteousness.â€

It's Tuesday, Aug. 28, 2018. Here are some of the stories we're talking about on ABC News' new daily podcast, ""Start Here.""





1. Trump ignores questions on McCain, eventually releases statement

Sen. John McCain has been dead for more than three days, yet he's still wielding tremendous political power.

ABC News Chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl told us about his repeated attempts yesterday to ask President Donald Trump about McCain.

2. Tuesday primaries in Arizona, Florida, Oklahoma

Voters across three states head to the polls today. In Arizona, the death of Sen. John McCain is on people's minds as they cast their ballots, but ABC News Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran said the Republican candidates for Senate ""are not in the McCain mold at all.""

""He's already a man of the past in his own party,"" Moran said.

And in Florida, several issues have been on the minds of voters choosing candidates for the midterms, including gun violence and displaced Puerto Rico residents, according to ABC News Political Director Rick Klein.

""There's been a lot of issues at play that are microcosms of the national debates that we're having,"" Klein said.

3. Trump announces trade deal with Mexico to replace NAFTA

The U.S. and Mexico agreed to revise some key parts of the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to the president yesterday.

But Canada was notably absent from the conversation -- and from the name of the deal: The United Statesâ€“Mexico Trade Agreement.

ABC News' Zunaira Zaki covers economics and said: ""He seemed to deliberately leave Canada out of that name, and that is now a precursor to what are going to be negotiations with Canada to get this deal together in a relatively short amount of time.""

4. UN report suggests genocide of Rohingya people in Myanmar

For years, the country of Myanmar, or Burma, was ruled by the country's military. They were in charge, and they were ruthless. Bloody crackdowns were the norm, and dissidents lived in fear, including Aung San Suu Kyi, a woman who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her non-violent resistance even as she was placed under house arrest for years.

Now she's the nation's democratically elected leader. But in the last year, we've seen more bloody crackdowns -- this time against a minority known as the Rohingya.

ABC News' Bob Woodruff said the United Nations issued a damning report saying this has all the markings of a genocide.

3FO95NVK5DI5ZE2IRTS1U4KM2B9SR3,Russia's road map to conquering the Republican Party,"Donald Trump at the National Prayer Breakfast

Events from the last week have surfaced at a moment that seems almost too perfect. As reported in the New York Times â€¦

According to the complaint unsealed on Monday, Ms. Butinaâ€™s promotional activities for Russian political interests included attending the National Prayer Breakfast twice.

Why was Butina, a covert agent of the Russian government posing as a representative of a pro-gun group connected to the NRA, there at the National Prayer Breakfast? Because thatâ€™s where the Republicans were. Thatâ€™s where the Right was. Because: God, guns, and gays.

The phrase â€œGod, guns, and gaysâ€ is often falsely attributed to President Obama, or Nancy Pelosi, or Hillary Clinton. But thatâ€™s not where it originated. It came out of the 1994 campaign of Republican Senator Jim Inhofeâ€”he of the snowball in the Senate, climate change-denying fame. The phrase â€œGod, guns, and gaysâ€ wasnâ€™t coined by Inhofeâ€™s team as an insult. It was intended to focus Oklahoma voters on social issues, so they would ignore Republican economic and environmental policies that were ruining their towns and lives. It was a strategy. For Russians looking a way to upend American politics, it was a road map.

For decades, the Republican Party had made taking a strong stand against Russia part of its core identity. After all, it was hard to position the GOP as the party of patriotism and defense, if it didnâ€™t make a show of standing up to Americaâ€™s greatest international opponent. But just as Gods, guns, and gays was a way to make a â€œshotgun weddingâ€ of a supposedly charitable religion and an anything-but political party, Russia saw that it also offered a path to not just reconciling Republicans with Moscow, but making them as thoroughly owned by the Kremlin as the Religious Right is by the GOP.

Maria Butina, though only a 22-year-old student, saw this clearly at least as early as 2011. So did her boss, Russian oligarch Alexander Torshin. In that year, Butina formed the faux pro-gun group â€œRight to Bear Arms,â€ not to actually champion the cause of gun rights in Russia, but as a way to reach out to the NRA and the right wing in the United States. Bolstered by money and praise from Torshin, the non-existent â€œgroupâ€ became an almost overnight power on the American right. As the Washington Post documents, it took only months for Butina to secure connections within the NRA. Less than two years after she began, former Russia hawk John Bolton was recording what amounted to a commercial for her group. By 2014, both Torshin and Butina were at the NRA convention, where they were treated as celebrities.",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2018/7/18/1781592/-God-guns-and-gays-Russia-s-road-map-to-conquering-the-Republican-Party#comments,"['Republican', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Republican', 'Democratic', 'Republican']","['3', '5', '3', '4', '5']"
34YWR3PJ29SPV14IRQF99G0R89NX0B,How Gloria Steinem Became The Unlikely Face Of A Lipstick Brand,"Gloria Steinem's Instagram feed looks exactly like what you'd expect Gloria Steinem's Instagram feed to look like: references to her many feminist and civil rights causes, weekly callouts featuring female political candidates you should know about, throwbacks from her second-wave '70s heyday, the occasional cat photo. In the iconic activist's world, even leopard-print Cole Haan boots come imbued with a social justice statement.

In one Instagram post back in May of 2017, Steinem shared her support for a new beauty brand, The Lipstick Lobby, and its new lipstick, Kiss My Pink. Publicly championing a lipstick might have seemed incongruous for a woman whose rich life has been lived largely without makeup as a personal choice, but this one made sense: Launched in defense of women's reproductive rights in the wake of the Trump election, 100% of net profits from the sale of the hot-pink shade went directly to Planned Parenthood.

When Davida Hall, the non-profit company's founder, caught wind that Steinem was a fan, a lightbulb went off -- Hall describes it as a ""watershed moment"" for the small, female-powered brand. ""Following our previous campaign [focusing on gun control law reform], we knew we wanted our next shade to focus on women, specifically those who really needed the visibility and resources,"" she tells Refinery29. ""Gloria and I met in New York, and we talked about how great it would be to collaborate together.""

This week, that partnership comes to life with In The Clear, a vitamin E-packed lip balm that will raise money and awareness for the unPrison Project, a female-led non-profit that works to empower incarcerated women by teaching them marketable skills, forming plans for life after prison, and helping them stay connected to their children. ""We must address the problems as we see it -- incarcerated women have the odds stacked up against them and do not have the resources to provide for themselves and their families or to get the help they need,"" Steinem says in a press release.

We all have a right to feel 'in the clear,' regardless of our past.

It was the feminist hero who led Hall and The Lipstick Lobby, which has also worked with the ACLU and The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, to the unPrison Project and its founder, Deborah Jiang-Stein. ""We were blown away by Deborah, and all the work she was doing singlehandedly inside these massive corrective facilities to help empower the women inside,"" Hall says. ""We felt that this was the perfect opportunity for The Lipstick Lobby to bring more awareness to this often misrepresented and ignored population of women.""

The Lipstick Lobby's previous launches have all involved bold, unapologetic colors; the kind of lipsticks that make a statement without saying a word. Hall says that, though Steinem's idea to create a clear balm was a departure at first, it ended up being the right decision -- and a fitting one at that. ""It really made total sense for our core values and mission: embracing that anyone and everyone could wear this shade,"" Hall says. ""Inclusivity is so key to who we are."" And anyway, as Hall told us during an interview earlier this year, ""We don't really consider ourselves a 'beauty brand'; we're a social justice brand, and yes, we make lipstick, but it's all about the proceeds, and where that money goes.""

The transparent treatment, which retails for $19, also lent itself perfectly to the apropos name, for which Hall gives full credit to Steinem. ""The name In The Clear has several meanings,"" she explains. ""It represents that symbolically, all women, including women who have served time in prison, deserve to have a clear and bright future. It speaks to our desire to be free of judgement and stigma -- something that we can all relate to. And ultimately a clear shade symbolizes the thousands of women who are invisible."" Steinem says, ""We all have a right to feel 'in the clear,' regardless of our past.""

YORKTOWN, Va. â€“ Just what were they thinking?

Arguments over gun control and gun rights lead to the United States Constitutionâ€™s Second Amendment â€“ 27 words approved in 1791 that are still being sifted through by legislatures and courts.

But at the American Revolution Museum at Yorktown, you can get a handle on what the Founding Fathers had in mind when drafting and approving the Bill of Rights. Of the 39 who signed the Constitution, most had participated militarily or politically in the 1775-1781 revolution. Among them were Gen. Alexander Hamilton, a Yorktown combat veteran, and James Madison, who represented Virginia at the Continental Congress in Philadelphia while the Battle of Yorktown effectively brought the Revolution to a close.

Here you can see, hear and smell the bang, boom and roar.

On a fast-warming June morning, grizzled interpreter Glenn Bittner is dressed as one of the outraged Shenandoah Valley farmers who followed Virginia Gen. Dan Morgan to New England in 1775. He holds up his musket and goes through the steps:

1. Make a quarter-turn away from the British, your muzzle still pointed toward the enemy.

2. Half-cock your musketâ€™s hammer; open the dinky pan underneath.

3. Use your free hand to reach into the shoulder-slung cartridge box. Withdraw a sealed paper cartridge, a load containing gunpowder and one musket ball. Bite open one end of the cartridge.

4. Pour the gunpowder into the open pan. Close the pan.

5. Put the cartridge wad, containing the musket ball and remaining gunpowder, in the barrel.

6. Withdraw the ramrod attached to the underside of the musket barrel. Use it to ram the wad deep into the musket barrel.

7. Return the ramrod to its place.

8. Raise the musket vertically; pull the hammer back fully. Youâ€™re ready.

9. Lower the barrel toward the enemy. Aim. Fire.

It gets tricky. All of this is done without the butt of the musket touching the ground. In company formation (60 to 80 men), an officer would bark step-by-step commands to orchestrate a devastating volley. There was always a chance your 10-pound musket would not fire.

Exploded black gunpowder in those days created a lot of acrid smoke. Though a well-trained unit could fire three times per minute, an enemy could suddenly appear through the smoke â€“ the literal â€œfog of war.â€ There should have been a bayonet at the end of your barrel, for piercing or slicing him. It would be good to also have a hatchet or knife slung from your belt, for hand-to-hand combat.

Outside and indoors

The Museum of the American Revolution, in downtown Philadelphia â€“ where independence was declared â€“ is a worthwhile attraction. But the American Revolution Museum at Yorktown is near the National Park Service-owned battlefield where American and French forces effectively won the revolution after a three-week siege that resulted in British Lord Cornwallis surrendering his trapped army on Oct. 19, 1781.

Yorkownâ€™s museum opened the same year as Philadelphiaâ€™s â€“ 2017. But its semi- rural location allows staff interpreters on the expansive grounds to load and fire replica long guns twice daily for visitors. Spring through fall, weekends on the grounds often feature encampments of re-enactment groups.

When artillery displays are offered, you experience the firing of unloaded replica fieldpieces maybe 15 feet away, behind a rope line. Youâ€™re warned to cover your ears, but the boom is often followed by the wails of startled infants.

From the outside, the one-story, 80,000-square-foot museum looks like a large, upscale motor inn. The permanent galleries show roughly 500 artifacts; displays and mini-theaters tell how 13 English colonies came to chafe under long-distance imperial rule, how decrees and incidents led to rebellion, independence, a post-war confederation, the Constitution and westward expansion.

Cool interactive flourishes include a wall projection of silhouettes of armed men heading off to war. Kids passing it are amazed to see their own shadows projected into the montage.

Start to finish, permanent galleries show the fluidity of the times â€“ how victories and defeats were often chancy.

A special exhibition, â€œBlast from the Pastâ€ (through Jan. 5), explores how iron or brass cannon, howitzers and mortars work, how they were manufactured in the 1700s, and how the disadvantaged revolutionaries had to rely on artillery captured from the British or shipped from France.

â€œBefore the revolution, it was illegal for colonists to manufacture artillery for their own purposes,â€ says exhibit curator Sarah Meschutt. â€œOnly one cannon foundry operated â€“ and that was for the British army.â€

Patriot casting efforts werenâ€™t always successful, given the steep learning curve for forging artillery. One reject on display, a 6-pounder forged in Maryland, was found buried in someoneâ€™s garden.

Also on display are unexploded mortar balls excavated in the 1970s from the Yorktown battlefield. They were still filled with 1781 gunpowder and had to be defused.

Visual gems in the show are French-issue bronze cannons sporting carefully worked decoration.

Weapons of less destruction

Independence led to a loose confederation with myriad problems. Hamilton and Madison pushed for the 1787 convention that group-wrote the federalizing Constitution for a â€œmore perfect unionâ€ and co-authored the Federalist Papers that greased the skids for its approval. The initial amendments were 1791 add-ons to coax ratification from the 13 wary states: Having recently won independence, they didnâ€™t want to surrender key rights to a new central government.

â€œThe Second Amendment has to do with concerns about the federal government controlling state militias,â€ says Kevin Hardwick, a colonial history professor at Virginiaâ€™s James Madison University. â€œPretty much all agreed that a standing army in times of peace was a bad idea: It could be misused to put the government in a more authoritarian direction. How do you protect against this? According to the theory of the time, you rely on citizen militia, like what is now the National Guard.

â€œIn slave states, they took this pretty seriously; they were always worried about slave insurrections. But all states had their own militia.â€

In 2008, Hardwick notes, the Supreme Court affirmed in District of Columbia v. Heller that Second Amendment militia protection extends to individuals who own/use weapons lawfully for self-defense.

So, how effective were those Revolution-era muskets?

â€œThey were effective for 100 yards â€“ the length of a football field,â€ says T.J. Savage, assistant supervisor in the Continental Army encampment at the Yorktown museum. â€œA musket ball could carry 200 to 300 yards, but youâ€™re not going to hit what youâ€™re aiming at. Hit rates are abysmal.â€

Muskets were effective in volleys: â€œThe key is putting a lot of lead down-range.â€

Flintlock pistols, used by mounted troops and sailors, had a range of about 25 yards, according to Savage.

Norman Fuss, a veteran re-enactor now with the museum interpretive crew, owns 10 French, American or British uniforms. In an outdoor tent in full redcoat dress, he was trying to convince a purple-haired 14-year-old to enlist in the â€œCorps of Engineers, Kings Army in America.â€

Like Savage, he also owns some pieces classified as antiques, not weapons. Fuss says he was a competitive target shooter for 40 years but is now focused on old guns â€œbecause I was bitten by the black powder bug. Itâ€™s too much fun.â€

At home, he keeps his weapons under lock and key, unloaded.

A sign at the museum entrance notes that guns are not allowed on the premises. Its director, Peter Armstrong, says â€œVirginia is an open-carry state, but by law no weapons are allowed in state facilities. In the four years Iâ€™ve been here, there have been no hassles about this with visitors.â€

Both he and curator Meschutt previously worked in England at the Royal Armouries, where centuries of weapons are preserved and displayed.

They both are British.

334ZEL5JX7X221A2Z1BX09FHRJ1OSS,A sleeping student wouldnâ€™t wake up in class. So an officer pulled out her Taser.,"The newly minted junior at Liberty Preparatory School was perhaps still on summer break schedule during class last week. His teacher couldn't wake him up. Even summoning the interim principal wasn't enough to get the teenager to open his eyes.

So the Smithville, Ohio, educators called for the school resource officer, a part-time member of the local police named Maryssa Boskoski, whose idea of an impromptu alarm could cost her job and maybe even her freedom.

As a classroom full of students looked on, she reached into her holster and pulled out her department-issued Taser, according to Cleveland ABC affiliate WEWS. Then she removed the firing cartridge and pulled the trigger.

Smithville school resource officer on leave after using Taser to wake up a student in class https://t.co/TCSAX9HVEN â€” News 5 Cleveland (@WEWS) September 5, 2018

The ensuing electric buzz startled the student awake and stunned a northeast Ohio charter school community that felt a weapon used to subdue combative criminals shouldn't be used to rouse a drowsy student.

A Taser is a brand of electronic stun gun that fires probes that stick in a person's skin and transmit 50,000 volts of electricity, along with a painful, paralyzing shock. But if the probe-containing cartridge is removed, the Taser can arc, emitting a visible bolt of electricity, an audible buzz and a painful jolt if it touches someone.

School officials notified parents of what they deemed an inappropriate use of the stun gun in a letter that did not reveal the identity of the student.

â€œWhile on our School campus, a Smithville officer attempted to wake a sleeping student by deploying a taser near the vicinity of the student,â€ school leaders said in a letter obtained by WTMJ. â€œAt no time was any student in any kind of danger.â€

Boskoski, who is also a member of the Air Force Reserve, works part time for the Smithfield Police Department. She could not immediately be reached for comment.

But Smithfield Police Chief Howard Funk says that Boskoski was previously disciplined for a separate Taser-related incident a month ago. Funk told the news station he was â€œdisappointed that this took place.â€ Boskoski is on unpaid leave.

[An 11-year-old was accused of shoplifting. An off-duty officer Tasered her in the back.]

An investigation was ongoing, according to the Associated Press, and Funk said he would meet with the Smithville solicitor to see if charges should be filed. Funk did not immediately return a message from The Washington Post seeking comment.

In the previous case, Boskoski didn't remove the cartridge from her Taser before doing what officers refer to as a spark test. When she pulled the trigger, the Taser fired near another officer.

Although originally marketed as less-than-lethal alternatives to officers pulling firearms, Tasers have been linked to dozens of deaths, according to a 2015 Washington Post report:

Research shows that when used correctly, the devices are generally safe and prevent injuries to both police officers and civilians. But when Tasers are used excessively or if officers donâ€™t follow department policy or product guidelines, the risk of injury or death can increase, according to company product warnings and police experts.

Taser issues can be particularly thorny for school resource officers. The combative people they encounter are often children, and officers' use of force can face additional scrutiny.

For example, officers said they couldn't subdue a girl who got into a fight at Morgan Fitzgerald Middle School in Pinellas Park, Fla.

Video captured by bystanders captured an officer shooting his Taser at the fleeing girl after she screamed, â€œGet off me!â€

â€œOnce they [students] get it in their heads that thatâ€™s how theyâ€™re going to be, then certainly it makes for a tough situation,â€ a school spokesman said, according to the Kansas City Star.

Maria Butina's lawyer says the Russian student came to the United States to study at American University. U.S. prosecutors claim the 29-year-old has been operating as a covert Russian agent.

Lead federal prosecutor Erik Michael Kenerson said he doesn't think Butina was in Washington â€œjust to attend American Universityâ€ but instead was participating in a â€œcovert influence campaign.â€

[Read the U.S. court filing seeking the detention of Maria Butina]

On Wednesday, Butina was jailed pending her trial, and in response the Russian Foreign Ministry asked supporters to participate in an online â€œflash mobâ€ and show their support for Butina by changing their social media avatars to a photo of her.

The ministry changed its own Twitter photo to feature Butina, and then tweeted in English, ""#NewProfilePic, #FreeMariaButina.â€

And on Saturday, the Foreign Ministry released a statement saying that in a phone call on Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that Butina should be released. Lavrov told his counterpart that she is being held ""on the basis of fabricated charges.""

As The Washington Post reported this week, a grand jury indicted the political science student Tuesday after prosecutors alleged that Butina tried â€œto advance the interests of the Russian Federationâ€ by infiltrating certain American political organizations. Butina has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and failing to declare herself as an agent of a foreign government.

Since arriving in the United States, Butina has advocated for gun rights and attended National Rifle Association conventions. At one NRA meeting, she spoke with President Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr. She has also managed to gain access to a number of political players, attending high-profile events such as the National Prayer Breakfast.

On Friday, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov told reporters in Moscow that the accusations against Butina are â€œtotally illegalâ€ and that Russia â€œwill demand her release so that she can calmly go home.â€

â€œThey're trying to break this girl,â€ he said. â€œBut she will not be broken.â€

Amie Ferris-Rotman in Moscow contributed to this report.

CHEERS to razzmatazz in the land of OKFLAZ. All eyeballs not riveted to porn tonight will be glued south of the mason-Dixon Line as primary results roll in from Oklahoma, Florida and Arizona. Here are some of the big races being decided ahead of the midterms, which are a mere 69 days away:

Florida: Rick Scott's reign of error is blissfully coming to an end, so tonight's action will decide the November contenders, one of whom will have the task of fumigating his office in January. For Democrats: Gwen Graham and Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum. For Republicans: Rep.Ron DeSantis and state agriculture commissioner Adam Putnam. Remember: if you take more than one â€œI Votedâ€ sticker, itâ€™s eighteen years in jail and a $200,000 fine, bub. Arizona: Governor's primaries will pit incumbent Republican Doug Ducey against Secretary of State Ken Bennett, and Democrats David Garcia and Kelly Fryer are duking it out for the chance to boot the winner. Also: Jeff Flake's senate seat is open, so there's action on both sides: Rep. Martha McSally vs. Trumpbot conspiracy wackos Dr. Kelli Ward and the freshly-pardoned crook Joe Arpaio on the Republican side, and Rep. Kyrsten Sinema vs. Deedra Abboud for Team D. It'll be fun watching Sheriff Joe get kicked to the curb one more time. Oklahoma: Just a Republican runoff for governor. The winner faces former Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson on November 6th.

There are also several House races in Florida and Arizona, and you can read the tea leaf readers' tea leaf readings via Daily Kos Elections here and Vox here. The DK Elections Team---""The Best in the Business!""---will be on duty tonight to liveblog all the action, and Steve Kornacki will be unleashed for another frenetic act of his one-man performance of The Ballot Ballet. Words of wisdom to his on-set tech crew: give him a wide berth when you see him in front of his interactive map screen or he'll swipe you into the next county.

JEERS to Captain Smallthinker. Neil Simon, eat yer Heaven-bound heart out. Yesterday the Trump Comedy Hour performed a guaranteed-to-become-a-classic sketch from the Oval Office, where a futzy speakerphone, a hapless assistant, and the ramblings of Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto and his translator provided enough hilarity for straight man Donald Trump to fume over that he's virtually assured the Emmy nomination that he's coveted so bigly for decades. The skit revolved around the Preliminary And Tentative Hypothetical Exploratory Trade Interrelation Concurrence (PATHETIC). David Frum gives the performance two thumbs up:

x Congratulations to the Trump administration on reaching a preliminary agreement in principle to begin negotiations with half of America's NAFTA counterparties with a view to revising one section of the trade agreement! David Frum (@davidfrum) August 27, 2018

He only makes the best deals. Unfortunately, these days it takes a magnifying glass to see them.

CHEERS to happy coincidences. Fifty-five years ago today, on August 28, 1963, an intimate gathering of 200,000 people watched as Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech (watch it here) from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. And ten years ago tonight Barack Obama echoed the words of King (among them: ""The fierce urgency of now"") when he spoke to a packed stadium in Denver as the first African-American presidential nominee in the history of the universe. This for me is still King's money quote:

""I have a dream my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but the content of their character.""

Or as modern day Republicans call it: a nightmare.

Emmett with his mom.

JEERS to the good dying much too young. Speaking of civil rights, today is the 63rd anniversary of the abduction and murder of 14 year-old Emmett Till---a shocking and disgraceful act that helped spark the civil rights movement in 1955. Till's original glass-topped casket (his remains were exhumed and re-buried in 2005) was restored and went on display at the Smithsonian's Museum of African American History and Culture. We hope his killers---who confessed after they were acquitted and never showed remorse before they died in 1980 and 1994---are currently in the process of feeling a certain burning sensation for eternity.

JEERS to America: land of the guns, home of the gun nuts. Speaking of senseless murders: what happens in the wake of the massacre in Newtown Aurora Binghamton Tucson Santa Barbara Charleston Lafayette Roseburg Kalamazoo Orlando Alexandria Las Vegas Benton Parkland etcetera etcetera etcetera Jacksonville, Florida during what was supposed to be a happy day of videogaming (3 dead, 11 wounded by an angry white guy, which is why Trump hasn't said a word about it) is depressingly predictable:

The community will grieve as the victims are buried. Gun control advocates, led by the Stoneman Douglas activists, will wisely suggest that this might be a good time to review our federal and state firearms policies so that our nation's shameful record of gun violence might be improved upon. The president and his minions will blame Democrats for the carnage and urge every living soul and their pets to arm themselves to the teeth, but not before insincerely offering their â€œthoughts and prayers.â€ And, this being Florida, aka Gun Carnage central, Marco Rubio will tweet out worthless Bible passages and Governor Rick Scott will again vow to â€œdo everything in my power to prevent this from happening againâ€ and then do nothing because snakes canâ€™t do much but eat and sun themselves on a rock. And the NRA will continue scaring Republican politicians into looking the other way by informing them that, ""We'll be scoring you on your response."" And it will all happen again sooner rather than later. Like I said, predictable. Depressingly.

CHEERS to history not repeating itself. On August 28, 1968, police and anti-war demonstrators made a giant clusterfuck of things in the streets of Chicago as the Democratic National Convention nominated Hubert Humphrey. In the wake of the fracas all the parties came together and instituted a new rule that has served conventions well ever since: Decaf, Decaf, Decaf.

3B6F54KMR3UH6931TZDMOD29YMRS11,Trump White House is what a real culture of corruption looks like (opinion),"John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst and anchor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) ""Drain the swamp"" was a popular chant at Trump rallies in 2016, ranking second only to the cries of ""Lock Her Up"" that still persist as a greatest hit at his presidential arena tours.

Nineteen months into the Trump administration, we're starting to see what a real culture of corruption looks like. None of it is normal.

Last week, the President's campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, became convicted felons. His first national security adviser, Gen. Michael Flynn, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. So did Manafort aide Rick Gates and Trump's campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, whose bragging about how he knew the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton kicked off the Russia investigation. And with a second Manafort trial yet to come and the Mueller investigation still incomplete, there may very well be more convictions on the horizon.

No wonder we've now been treated to the spectacle of the President of the United States musing to Fox News about how there ""almost"" should be a law that makes ""flipping"" illegal . For mob bosses, and in popular culture, giving evidence to law enforcement spawned the phrase ""snitches get stitches."" It is also known as finally telling the truth to prosecutors when under oath.

The way we know this isn't normal is that we can compare the Trump presidency with those of his predecessors. And the comparison ain't pretty.

Let's narrow the comparison to a look at how many members of the different administrations' executive branch became convicted felons in the 50 years since Richard Nixon was elected.

Counting backwards, we'll start with President Trump's nearest predecessor, President Obama.

After all, it was the Obama administration that Trump and his followers were targeting most directly with the talk of draining the swamp and the culture of government corruption. But it turns out that over eight years there was only one person in the Obama executive branch who pleaded guilty to a crime -- and it was a misdemeanor. That would be then-CIA director David Petraeus, who pleaded guilty to one count of removing and retaining classified information in conjunction with a tawdry affair. He received two years probation and paid a $100,000 fine.

How about George W. Bush? The man was widely regarded as personally honest but eight members of his administration got caught up in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. In total, there were 21 criminal convictions and guilty pleas from 43's administration and 10 prison sentences -- including Vice President Dick Cheney's Chief of Staff Scooter Libby, who had his sentence commuted by President Bush and recently received a full pardon from President Trump.

Bill Clinton's administration was certainly beset by scandal -- but much of it was self-inflicted and sexual in nature, most notoriously the Monica Lewinsky affair that came to light thanks to special prosecutor Ken Starr's Whitewater Investigation. Shades of 1998 are back on the radar these days, as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and current Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein both served on Starr's investigation.

But Clinton's executive branch had only two convictions and guilty pleas: former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros, who pleaded guilty to lying about payments to a mistress dating back to his time as mayor of San Antonio, and Ronald Blackley , a chief of staff to Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy who lied to an independent counsel looking into his boss for accepting improper gifts. Espy was acquitted and is currently running for Senate in Mississippi.

President George H. W. Bush presided over a comparatively clean administration, with only one conviction and prison sentence doled out to a senior member of his administration. Catalina V. Villalpando, the US treasurer, whose name was printed on all dollars, pleaded guilty to three felony counts after leaving office, including tax evasion, obstruction of justice and making false statements.

Which brings us to Saint Ronald Reagan. He was an honest man, but it might surprise many of his conservative acolytes today that his administration saw a whopping 24 convictions and guilty pleas over eight years. They were largely related to the Iran-Contra scandal, whose most famous protagonist today is probably Oliver North, formerly of Fox News and now the NRA.

Those investigations ultimately ensnared his Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and two national security advisers, John Poindexter and Robert McFarlane, among others. Many of the convictions were for withholding information or lying to Congress . Some of the convictions were overturned on appeal and ultimately no one from the Reagan administration served jail-time -- thanks in large part to a series of pardons issued by President George H. W. Bush, who maintained that the special counsel investigation was politically motivated.

The one-term administrations of Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford may have been a time of economic malaise, but neither White House saw a single conviction or jail time while in office, though Ford's Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz was later convicted of tax evasion.

Then there was Richard Nixon, the only president to resign from office. After he won a 49-state landslide re-election in 1972, the Watergate scandal consumed his administration.

The dozens of Nixon administration and campaign aides convicted, at least 10 of whom were primary players who served jail time in connection with Watergate, were not small players. Even before Watergate broke wide open, Nixon's ""law and order"" Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned i n disgrace for accepting bribes when he was governor of Maryland.

But the Watergate break-in and subsequent cover-up claimed large portions of the powerful West Wing staff and Cabinet confidants -- including the attorney general and campaign chairman John Mitchell, the White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman, senior domestic policy adviser John Ehrlichman and other White House and senior campaign staff. Nixon -- whose lawyer James St. Clair said had ordered him to make the case that ""he is as powerful a monarch as Louis XIV, only four years at a time"" -- was of course pardoned by his successor, Gerald Ford after his resignation.

This is a sobering and sordid list -- and while the bulk of these convictions and pleas occurred under Republican presidents, they're all a reminder that every administration has its scandals and bad apples. But this reality check also reveals that not every administration is the same when it comes to creating a culture of corruption -- and less than two years into his administration, President Donald Trump may be on pace to equal or exceed the record set by his swampiest predecessor, Richard Nixon.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/28/opinions/trump-swamp-convictions-since-nixon-avlon/index.html,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic']","['1', '1', '2', '1', '1']"
3GITHABACZ3RFHTS47WEU2283TXN21,FOX NEWS FIRST: Trump wants White House official behind NY Times op-ed ID'd; DOJ targets conservative censorship,"Welcome to FOX News First. Not signed up yet? Click here.

Developing now, Thursday, Sept. 6, 2018

President Trump demands that the â€˜gutlessâ€™ author of an anonymous New York Times op-ed article be revealed. The newspaper claims the writer was a â€œsenior administration officialâ€ inside the White House.

Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh faced a second day of grilling on Capitol Hill, with Democratic senators questioning him on topics ranging from the Mueller investigation, to his alleged ties to the president's inner circle, to racial profiling.

The Justice Department announced it will investigate whether social media giants are intentionally censoring conservatives as Facebook and Twitter executives defended their practices in hearings on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.

Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his commitment to denuclearization and expressed faith that President Trump could settle stalled nuclear talks between the North Korea and the U.S., state media reported.

Hurricane Florence has been upgraded to a Category 4 storm and could cause life-threatening conditions in Bermuda by the end of this week, forecasters warn.

THE LEAD STORY - 'THE RESISTANCE' WITHIN TRUMP'S RANKS: The New York Times on Wednesday published an explosive opinion piece that the paper says was written by an anonymous senior White House official who described a ""two-track presidency"" in which top officials were ""working diligently from within to frustrate parts of [President Trump's] agenda and his worst inclinations"" ... The piece quickly triggered anger from inside the White House, as President Trump called it ""gutless,"" and press secretary Sarah Sanders demanded the unnamed author ""resign.""

In the piece, titled ""I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,"" the author wrote that the alleged actions by White House officials were not part of ""the popular 'resistance' of the left."" Trump responded by questioning whether the anonymous senior White House official even existed, tweeting: ""Does the so-called 'Senior Administration Official' really exist, or is it just the Failing New York Times with another phony source? If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!""

By late Wednesday night, Trump lamented in a tweet that he was ""draining the Swamp"" but the ""Swamp was trying to fight back."" However, the president vowed, ""We will win.""

COMBATIVE EXCHANGES AT KAVANAUGH HEARING: The second day of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings boiled over into a series of tense exchanges late in the evening Wednesday, as high-profile Democrats lined up to hammer the appellate judge with thinly veiled accusations that he was hiding ties to President Trump's inner circle and harbored sympathies for racist policies ... In an especially combative moment late in the day, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., pointedly asked Kavanaugh whether he ever had discussed Special Counsel Robert Mueller or his Russia probe with anyone at Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by Marc Kasowitz, a former personal attorney to President Trump.

In another dramatic exchange, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., implied Kavanaugh had been open to racial profiling tactics, citing an email exchange between Kavanaugh and a colleague. However, Booker did not provide Kavanaugh a copy of the emails to review while questioning him about it, prompting an objection from Sen. Mike Lee, who charged that it was inappropriate to ""cross-examine"" Kavanaugh about documents that he ""can't see.""

Testimony in Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation is scheduled to resume at 9:30 a.m. ET Thursday.

SOCIAL MEDIA 'STIFLING' TARGETED: The Justice Department on Wednesday announced Attorney General Jeff Sessions will convene a meeting with state attorneys general this month to discuss long-standing concerns by conservatives that social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are ""stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms"" ... The announcement came after a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing involving top officials from Facebook and Twitter, and ahead of a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on alleged bias and lack of transparency, where Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testified.

There was no date set for the meeting. And it was not immediately clear how many attorneys general would attend the meeting.

NEW HOPE FOR A NUKE-FREE NORTH KOREA? - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his South Korean counterpart will meet later this month to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, his state-controlled media reported Thursday ... Kim also expressed faith in President Trumpâ€™s efforts to settle a nuclear impasse, despite recent bumps in diplomacy, the report said. Chung Eui-yong, a special envoy from South Korea, told reporters that Kim stressed that ""he has never talked negative about President Trump to his staff or anyone else,"" South Korea's Yonhap News reported.

Chung reportedly said North Korea expressed hope to improve the ""North-U.S. relationship within Trump's first term."" The statement comes after a South Korean envoy met with Kim to set up the inter-Korean summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

Trump says 'no reason' for costly U.S.-South Korea war games, relationship with Kim Jong Un is 'very good'

HURRICANE FLORENCE INTENSIFIES: Florence, the first major storm of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, was upgraded to a Category 4 storm Wednesday as forecasters warned it could cause ""life-threatening"" surf and rip current conditions in Bermuda later this week ... According to the National Hurricane Center, Florence's maximum sustained winds are estimated to be 130 miles per hour. The storm is centered about 1,295 miles east-southeast of Bermuda and is moving northwest at 13 mph. Forecasters have said they expect Florence to weaken somewhat over the next couple of days, but the storm is predicted to remain a powerful hurricane through early next week. The National Hurricane Center said that the swells generated by Florence would begin to affect Bermuda on Friday.

3EQVJH0T413TPK1UKOLXQ5E2H7THTW,Dr. Marc Siegel: Killing of cardiologist who treated President George H.W. Bush robs us of a great healer,"The shooting death of prominent Houston interventional cardiologist Dr. Mark Hausknecht â€“ who treated former President George H.W. Bush years ago for an irregular heartbeat and who prolonged and saved many lives during his long career â€“ deprives patients of a skilled and caring healer.

How many more lives could this skilled doctor, who was 65 and in apparent good health, have saved had he not been taken from us? Weâ€™ll never know.

Hausknecht, who trained at Johns Hopkins University in the1980s and who practiced in Houston since 1987, was bicycling to work when he was gunned down Friday morning by another cyclist. Police are working to identify and apprehend the killer.

Known among his contemporaries for his bedside manner, Hausknechtâ€™s career had spanned the major advances in heart technology. These ranged from balloon angioplasty â€“ which first opened coronary arteries without surgery â€“ to the introduction of bare metal stents, to the changeover to stents made of an alloy that releases a chemical that prevents inflammation and premature artery closure.

Hausknecht was an avid cyclist, setting a good example of the value of exercise for his patients. Cycling is a cardiovascular exercise well-suited to a cardiologist who understands the important physiology of dilating vessels leading away from the heart, taking the pressure off the hardest working muscle in the body.

President George H.W. Bush released a statement calling Dr. Hausknecht a â€œfantastic cardiologist and a good man,â€ and expressed gratitude for his â€œexceptional compassionate care.â€

The doctor worked at Houston Methodist Hospital and the world renowned DeBakey Heart and Vascular Center.

No one knows at this point if the shooting of Hausknecht was premeditated, grudge-related, or random. Doctors sometimes worry about disgruntled patients becoming psychotic and attacking them, though we have no idea if this was the case here.

Hausknechtâ€™s widow â€“ emergency physician Dr. Georgia R. Hsieh â€“ issued a statement Saturday calling for stricter gun control â€“ an issue some doctors describe as a public health problem.

â€œ'Senseless' has become a trite adjective to describe these tragedies, but what IS senseless is the misguided notion that any society with more guns is a safer society,"" Dr. Hsieh wrote. ""When students cannot go to school without fear, and teachers need to arm themselves, what has this country come to?""

After he was shot, an ambulance in the area stopped to take Hausknechtâ€™s vital signs but had to call the fire department to bring the wounded doctor to the hospital, since the ambulance was already carrying a patient. Consider the irony of a full ambulance being unable to transport a shot doctor who has saved many lives â€“ though there is no definite reason to believe that this delay is what cost him his life.

President George H.W. Bush released a statement calling Dr. Hausknecht a â€œfantastic cardiologist and a good man,â€ and expressed gratitude for his â€œexceptional compassionate care.â€

Google reviews, which are often filled with derogatory comments, were glowing and complimentary, with several reviewers calling Hausknecht simply â€œthe best.â€

It is easy for a doctor like Hausknecht to feel indispensable, because the stents he placed, the impact of the medications he gave and the kindness he showed his patients stay with them for the rest of their lives. Consider that interventional cardiologists are leaving their signature stents inside the most important arteries in the human body.

Doctors can be appreciated or even cherished, but we are not irreplaceable. Other cardiologists will step in to treat patients Hausknecht would have treated. But it is particularly sad that a compassionate and brilliant man who devoted his life to saving the lives of others â€“ and could have saved so many more â€“ has been killed by an evil man who made it his mission to destroy life.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/07/22/dr-marc-siegel-killing-cardiologist-who-treated-president-george-h-w-bush-robs-us-great-healer.html,"['Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Democratic']","['3', '3', '2', '5', '5']"

The FBI told a secret federal surveillance court in 2016 that it believed Carter Page, a onetime foreign policy aide to President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign, â€œhas been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian governmentâ€ in its efforts to interfere in the presidential election, according to a trove of documents made public late Saturday. The FBI released more than 400 pages of documents in response to lawsuits by USA TODAY and other media organizations. Trump on Sunday used the document release to criticize the Justice Department's handling of the Russia investigation, which he once again described in a tweet as a ""witch hunt"" against his administration. Page denied the assertions.

A private safety inspector says he warned the company nearly a year ago that a design flaw in some of the vehiclesâ€™ exhaust could cause them to sink in choppy water.

Ohio State students allege sexual abuse by ex-team doctor

More than 100 former Ohio State students have come forward with sexual misconduct allegations against a former team doctor, the school announced Friday. Ohio State hired an outside firm to conduct an investigation into Richard Strauss after several former wrestlers earlier this year alleged they were subjected to sexual abuse or harassment. Strauss, who died by suicide in 2005, served in various roles in his 20 years at Ohio State, including more than a decade as a team doctor.

Alleged spy Maria Butina paid by Russian billionaire Konstantin Nikolaev

Maria Butina, the Russian citizen accused of attempting to infiltrate U.S. political organizations, received financial support from a Russian billionaire with ties to U.S. energy and technology firms, according to a Washington Post report Sunday. Butina, 29, was arrested last weekend and charged with trying to influence groups like the National Rifle Association. In April, Butina told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Konstantin Nikolaev, a Russian billionaire, provided funding for a guns right group she represented, according to the Post. A spokesman for Nikolaev told the Post that the businessman was in contact with Butina but declined to confirm whether he offered money.

WASHINGTON â€“ Democrats hoping to make inroads in Wisconsin nominated iron worker Randy Bryce â€“ known as the â€œIron Stacheâ€ â€“ on Tuesday to compete for House Speaker Paul Ryan's seat.

In Minnesota, former GOP Gov. Tim Pawlenty lost his bid to get his old job back. And Vermont Democrats nominated the nation's first transgender gubernatorial candidate from a major political party.

Here's a look at results from Tuesday's primary contests in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Connecticut and Vermont, where voters cast ballots for House, Senate and gubernatorial races:

Wisconsin

Bryce, a U.S. Army veteran, significantly outraised his opponent, Janesville School Board Member Cathy Myers, and is financially well-positioned to compete for Ryan's seat in November.

He faces Ryan's former staffer, University of Wisconsin regent Bryan Steil, who won the GOP primary. He is an attorney for a manufacturing company.

But Bryce's history of arrests, including operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol in 1998, could be problematic. Myers also filed a Federal Election Commission complaint against him, claiming he converted campaign funds to personal use.

Republicans were eager to pounce on Bryce's record.

Meanwhile, State Schools Superintendent Tony Evers won the Democratic gubernatorial primary, which drew a field of eight candidates vying to oust GOP Gov. Scott Walker. And while analysts say the race leans Republican in the fall, polls suggest Walker is vulnerable.

Evers told the Associated Press that he will ""take the fight to Walker,"" attacking him on his record while talking about issues Wisconsin voters care about, including education and jobs.

In another Wisconsin race that drew attention, state Sen. Leah Vukmir defeated Marine Corps veteran and first-time candidate Kevin Nicholson in an intense GOP Senate primary battle. Vukmir will take on Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is favored to win in the fall. In nominating Vukmir, GOP voters looked past a video from 2016 that recently emerged showing her bashing the president as â€œoffensive to everyone.â€

Vukmir was the establishment favorite endorsed by the state party, while Nicholson portrayed himself as a conservative outsider. He was endorsed by conservative organizations, including Club for Growth, though he was once a rising star in the Democratic Party.

Minnesota

The race to replace retiring Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton in November is a toss-up, analysts say, in a state former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won by only 1.5 percentage points.

In the GOP primary, County Commissioner Jeff Johnson defeated former Gov. Tim Pawlenty, denying him a shot at the job he left in 2011. Pawlenty was favored to win, but Johnson positioned himself as the more conservative choice. He attacked Pawlenty for calling then-candidate Donald Trump ""unhinged and unfit"" in 2016, even though Johnson back then called Trump a ""jackass.""

The Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination went to U.S. Rep Tim Walz, despite the party's endorsement of state Rep. Erin Murphy.

Walz and Rep. Rick Nolan left open two of Democratsâ€™ most vulnerable seats in the country â€“ each voted for Trump â€“ to run for statewide office.

In Walzâ€™s southern Minnesota district, Democrats nominated former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Dan Feehan, while Republicans nominated 2014 and 2016 nominee Jim Hagedorn, who came within a point of beating Walz in 2016.

The DFL primary nod in Nolanâ€™s Iron Range district went to Nolanâ€™s 2016 campaign manager and former state Rep. Joe Radinovich. Republicans nominated St. Louis County Commissioner Pete Stauber.

State Rep. Ilhan Omar won the Democratic nomination to compete for a safe blue district in Minneapolis being vacated by Rep. Keith Ellison, who is running for state attorney general and won his primary. If she wins in November, Omar, who once lived in a Kenyan refugee camp, would become the first Somali-American in the House.

Sen. Tina Smith, who was appointed to fill a vacancy left by Sen. Al Franken, defeated a high-profile special election challenger in Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush White House who left the GOP and has become a hero to the resistance as a frequent Trump critic. She will face state Sen. Karin Housley, who is married to NHL's Buffalo Sabres Head Coach Phil Housley, in November.

Connecticut

Retiring Democratic Gov. Dan Malloyâ€™s deep unpopularity gives Republicans a shot at the governorâ€™s mansion in this blue state for the first time in eight years.

The GOP nod went to political newcomer Bob Stefanowski, a former GE executive who dubbed himself Bob the Rebuilder, in an upset. Stefanowski, who wants to eliminate the personal income tax, defeated the state party's endorsed candidate, Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton, and three others.

Stefanowski will face Democrat Ned Lamont, a businessman and 2010 gubernatorial candidate. Lamont won his primary against Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim, who made a political comeback after serving time in prison for corruption charges during an earlier stint in elected office.

A scandal opened up the stateâ€™s most competitive House district in April, when Rep. Elizabeth Esty announced she would not seek re-election amid mounting criticism for her delay in firing a chief of staff accused of sexually harassing a woman in her office.

Still, the congressional delegation's all-Democratic makeup isnâ€™t expected to change this cycle. Political newcomer Jahana Hayes, who was the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, defeated former Simsbury First Selectman Mary Glassman in a two-way Democratic primary for this seat.

While Glassman touted her experience and had the partyâ€™s convention endorsement, Hayes was encouraged to run by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and has the endorsement of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. If she wins in November, Hayes will be the stateâ€™s first black Democrat and first black woman elected to Congress.

Her GOP opponent is Manny Santos, the former mayor of Meriden.

Murphy will face small-business owner Matthew Corey, a three-time congressional candidate, in the fall, but he is expected to retain his seat.

Vermont

Vermont Democrats made history, nominating Christine Hallquist, the nation's first transgender gubernatorial candidate from a major political party.

Hallquist, a former utility CEO, defeated three other Democrats in her primary. She now faces Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, who is seeking his second term.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the longest-serving independent in Congress, won the state's Democratic primary but he is expected to turn down the nomination and run as an independent, as he has done in the past.

His potential GOP opponents are unlikely to make headway against Sanders, who won his last election with 71 percent of the vote. Sanders, who ran in the Democratic primary for president in 2016, is now running for his third Senate term.

Rep. Peter Welch, a Democrat, also won his primary and will face GOP opponent, H. Brooke Paige, a perennial candidate, in November.

391FPZIE4D48PXGJKTB7V104088HU5,Russian 'agent' held on charges of seeking to infiltrate US govt,"Washington (AFP) â€“ A Russian gun rights enthusiast who built a network of powerful Republican contacts under the direction of a Kremlin power-broker was ordered held without bond Wednesday after FBI counterintelligence agents accused her of conspiring to infiltrate the US government.

US prosecutors said Maria Butina, 29, exploited her close links with the powerful NRA gun lobby while posing as a visiting graduate student to endear herself with senior Republicans, guided by one of Russian President Vladimir Putinâ€™s major political supporters, Alexander Torshin.

Butina was charged in the Washington federal court with acting illegally as an unregistered agent for the Russian government while she lived in Washington over the past three years with her boyfriend, a veteran Republican operative.

They called Butina a â€œcovert Russian agentâ€ who maintained contacts with Russian spies and pursued a mission â€œto penetrate the US national decision-making apparatus to advance the agenda of the Russian Federation.â€

That included offering sex to get a job in a US lobbying group, according to documents filed in court by the Department of Justice.

Butina pleaded not guilty to two criminal charges of conspiring to act as a foreign agent without registering, and acting as a foreign agent. The first charge brings a maximum five years in prison, while the second carries a maximum 10 years.

â€œThis is not a spy case,â€ her lawyer Robert Driscoll said after Butina appeared in court in an orange jumpsuit.

â€œThe government is speculating that someone is a Russian spy, but thousands of Russians met intelligence operativesâ€ in the United States, he said.

â€“ Russian political meddling â€“

Butinaâ€™s arrest Sunday added to the political turmoil in Washington over Russiaâ€™s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and allegations that President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign collaborated with the Russians.

The arrest was announced Monday hours after Trump finished a summit and a press conference with Putin in Helsinki, Finland, where the US leader rejected the US intelligence communityâ€™s verdict that the Russians meddled to support him over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 race.

Trump reversed that stance a day later under heavy attack from US politicians of both parties.

FBI agents described a long-term operation stretching back as far as 2011 when Torshin met then-National Rifle Association president David Keene and Butina launched a mirror Russian gun rights group named The Right to Bear Arms.

She befriended the Republican operative, unnamed in the indictment but widely identified as Paul Erickson, 56, who opened doors to NRA and Republican circles.

Butina began visiting the United States and was regularly hosted by the NRA and other groups, and became a â€œlife memberâ€ of the American gun rights lobby.

Pictures of her meeting prominent Republican governors and congressman, and the powerful leaders of the NRA, are splashed across her social media accounts.

In July 2015, Butina was selected to ask Trump a question about his plans for ties with Russia at a rally in Las Vegas.

â€œI believe I would get along very nicely with Putinâ€¦. I donâ€™t think youâ€™d need the sanctions,â€ he said, in possibly his first campaign trail pronouncement on the issue.

Her activities ramped up after she moved to the US capital on a student visa in 2016, attending American University graduate school while she lived with Erickson.

Hardly masking her networking efforts, she told colleagues at the school that she had a nearly direct line to Putin.

She helped arrange visits by Torshin and other Russian officials to major political events like the National Prayer Breakfast, as they sought to construct a â€œback channelâ€ with sympathetic, influential Americans.

Meanwhile Erickson, citing his Russian connections, tried to arrange a meeting between Putin and Trump in early 2016.

And that year Butina reportedly met Trumpâ€™s son Donald Trump Jr. at a private dinner in Louisville, Kentucky during the NRA annual convention.

â€“ Moscow condemns arrest â€“

The FBIâ€™s investigation of Butina began before the probe led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and the indictment did not involve Muellerâ€™s team.

But the two investigations clearly overlapped, and Butina has already been interviewed by the Senate committee studying Russian meddling.

On Wednesday Moscow said the arrest was a political move seeking undermine the gains of the Helsinki summit.

â€œThis happened with the obvious task of minimizing the positive effect,â€ of the Trump-Putin meeting, said foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.

US prosecutors say Maria Butina, 29, exploited her close links with the powerful NRA gun lobby while posing as a visiting graduate student to endear herself with senior Republicans, guided by one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's major political supporters, Alexander Torshin.

She was charged this week in Washington of acting illegally as an unregistered agent for the Russian government while she lived in Washington over the past three years with her boyfriend, a veteran Republican operative.

In a telephone call with Pompeo, Lavrov ""stressed that the actions of American authorities who arrested the Russian citizen Butina based on false accusations is totally unacceptable,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Lavrov said Butina must be released ""as soon as possible,"" according to the statement.

The two diplomats also ""exchanged views on ways to develop the relationship between our countries with the objective of normalising them"".

Butina's arrest on Sunday added to the political turmoil in Washington over Moscow's meddling in the 2016 presidential election and allegations that President Donald Trump's campaign collaborated with the Russians.

391FPZIE4D48PXGJKTB7V104088UHI,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: The Democrat who challenged her partyâ€™s establishment â€” and won,"In the spring of 2017, before she ended the 20-year congressional career of Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) and upset her cityâ€™s most powerful political machine, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was working behind a bar. She had helped launch Flats Fix, a tacos and craft cocktail spot in Manhattan, while pondering what to do next.

â€œI was taking brunch orders, with the AC off, and people from progressive political groups were calling me,â€ she said last week in an interview.

She had organized for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in New York, but he lost the Democratic presidential primary. She had rallied at Standing Rock, the site of Native American protests against a pipeline that would endanger their North Dakota land. She had worked with Bronx Progressives and the Democratic Socialists of America to lobby Crowleyâ€™s office; she was cheered when the congressman endorsed the Houseâ€™s â€œMedicare for Allâ€ legislation.

In May, encouraged by the activists sheâ€™d been working with, the 28-year-old Ocasio-Cortez filed to challenge Crowley. It was a long shot, but it was at least a way to build a political movement. â€œIf [the district] can be more educated, more organized, more invested than we were a year ago,â€ Ocasio told WYNC in November 2017, â€œthen this campaign will have been 100 percent worth it.â€

Ocasio-Cortez now looks to be on her way to Congress, running in a district that gave 78 percent of its vote to Hillary Clinton and that Republicans arenâ€™t seriously contesting. There, she could be the youngest woman elected by either political party. Before this year, Crowley had never come close to losing in New Yorkâ€˜s 14th Congressional District. Republican reaction to Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s win was mostly about Crowleyâ€™s defeat and how his partyâ€™s establishment had lost to a self-described socialist.

That was what Ocasio-Cortez had set out to do â€” replace the party establishment, and the Queens Democratic Party machine controlled by Crowley, with a new establishment and a new electorate. Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress, among the progressive groups that had urged her to run, ended up staffing her campaign. She wasnâ€™t inclined to back House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi for speaker, name-checking one of the Houseâ€™s most left-wing members as a better choice.

â€œIâ€™d like to see new leadership, but I donâ€™t even know what our options are,â€ she said. â€œI mean, is Barbara Lee running? Call me when she does!â€

Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s politics are substantially to the left of most of the party, and even Sanders. In her campaign videos and posters, designed by friends from New Yorkâ€™s socialist circles, she came out for the abolition of ICE, universal Medicare, a federal jobs guarantee and free college tuition. The ads also made it clear that she was a different candidate â€” a young Latina from the Bronx, not a white man from Queens.

The posters, which she said were designed to look â€œrevolutionary,â€ were bilingual and centered her face; her viral campaign video, created by a socialist team called Means of Production, began with her saying that â€œwomen like me arenâ€™t supposed to run for officeâ€ over an image of her getting ready for the day in a busy apartment building.

â€œThe only time we create any kind of substantive change is when we reach out to a disaffected electorate and inspire and motivate them to vote,â€ Ocasio-Cortez told the left-wing magazine In These Times, in one of many interviews she gave as her campaign seemed to surge in the final weeks. â€œThat is how Obama won and got reelected, and thatâ€™s how Bernie Sanders did so well.â€

Support from better-known national liberal groups did not come until late in the campaign. The Working Families Party, which has helped primary challengers and insurgents across the state, endorsed Crowley. So did Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has become a leading left-wing figure in the party. Only one member of Congress endorsed her â€” and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) hedged his bets by also endorsing Crowley.

In the final weeks, though there was no public or private polling showing Crowley in danger, the endorsements tumbled in. One week before the election, MoveOn announced that it was endorsing Ocasio-Cortez; her campaign team pointed out that there were more than 10,000 MoveOn members in the district. Cynthia Nixon, the activist and actor running for governor against Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), endorsed Ocasio-Cortez over the final weekend, and hit the trail with her the day before the election.

Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s victory party in the Bronx was a demonstration of the rising left wing; Nixon came by, as did Democrats challenging state senators of their own party who had caucused with Republicans. While national media looked elsewhere, media at the party included two hosts of the left-wing Chapo Trap House podcast, documentary filmmaker Josh Fox, and Ryan Grim, the D.C. bureau chief of the Intercept, which had published a run of stories on her race.

In interviews last week, as Ocasio-Cortez canvassed voters in Queens, she said her campaign began with grass-roots organizers and took off once national left-wing media noticed what she was doing. The Young Turks, a YouTube-based left-wing news channel, interviewed her multiple times and sent reporters to cover her race and district. An early profile in the Intercept, she said, was â€œa game-changer,â€ leading to more interviews and profiles that led with the audacity of her challenge, then got to her policies. By the final week of the campaign, when she briefly left the state to see conditions at immigrant detention centers in Texas, she was updating Vogue on how the campaign was going.

â€œThe biggest hurdle that our communities have is cynicism â€” saying itâ€™s a done deal, who cares, thereâ€™s no point to voting,â€ Ocasio-Cortez told volunteers before one of their canvasses. â€œIf we can get somebody to care, itâ€™s a huge victory for the movement and the causes weâ€™re trying to advance.â€

Why challenge Crowley? She would explain: He was a â€œcorporate Democrat,â€ who received more money from corporate PACs than from local donors â€” and from the developers who were driving up housing costs. He had voted to create the Department of Homeland Security. Heâ€™d voted for the war in Iraq. Heâ€™d voted for PROMESA, the bill that created a hated bankruptcy board to handle Puerto Ricoâ€™s debt.

â€œMy grandfather died in the storm,â€ Ocasio-Cortez tweeted last month. â€œYour acts shut schools and starved public services when we needed them most.â€

None of that had stopped Crowley in the past, but Ocasio-Cortez was convinced that it could â€” if she met the voters who were angry about it. Her campaign began with phone banks that targeted thousands of unaffiliated voters, informing them that they needed to register as Democrats six months before the election if they wanted to vote in the primary. It purchased the Democratic voter list, but Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s team found the built-in technology to be too clumsy, so they built their own app and handed it to volunteers.

The campaignâ€™s greatest weapon was Ocasio-Cortez herself, who proved to be a natural candidate with a compelling story. She was the first to admit that she had bounced around, from Sen. Ted Kennedyâ€™s office to the National Hispanic Institute to political organizing to the service industry. She had to; her family had been hit hard during the 2008 financial crisis.

Crowley did not take the challenge lightly, spending $1.5 million, more than five times as much as his opponent. In his own campaign messaging, Crowley called himself â€œJoe from Queensâ€ and emphasized how his clout in Washington made him an ideal opponent to Donald Trump.

In his one televised debate with Ocasio-Cortez, Crowley briefly went on the offensive, telling viewers that his opponent had once said that New Yorkâ€™s gun laws didnâ€™t need to be applied in other states. The attack was true â€” Ocasio-Cortez had said it in a Reddit forum â€” but she laughed it off, called it â€œtrolling on the Internet,â€ and he moved on.

Ocasio-Cortez simply outplayed Crowley, whom many congressional reporters saw as a potential speaker of the House, across the media. One of her greatest coups came a week before the primary, when a Bronx newspaper held a candidate forum and Crowley could not attend. Ocasio-Cortez showed up early, shaking hands even though the crowd was thin.

Crowley had sent Annabel Palma, a former city councilwoman, to take his place, even though she occasionally confessed not to know Crowleyâ€™s positions on issues in front of Congress. (She was heckled after saying, correctly, that Crowley supported moving Americaâ€™s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The day that embassy was moved, Ocasio-Cortez condemned the â€œmassacreâ€ of Palestinians who had protested it, and tweeted that â€œDemocrats canâ€™t be silent about this anymore.â€

The first-time candidate was clearly getting the best of the longtime city councilwoman. Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s focus stayed on Crowley. Early in the debate, before she was told not to stand during answers, she paced the stage and said her campaign was of, by and for the Bronx.

â€œWe have touched the hearts and minds of all families here. We are fighting for an unapologetic movement for economic, social, and racial justice in the United States,â€ Ocasio-Cortez said.

She turned and faced Palma. â€œWith all due respect,â€ she said, â€œIâ€™m the only one running for Congress in this room.â€

3VCK0Q0PO6WKJ7QEPKS0BE9T685N0Z,"Cuomo has wasted billions, and somehow he's still here","By any standard or sane measure, Gov. Andrew Cuomo should be running scared. Joseph Percoco, one of his closest advisors and friends -- ""my father's third son,"" Cuomo once said -- was convicted of sleazy, felonious self-dealing and is scheduled to be sentenced to federal prison next week, probably for a good long time.

Meanwhile, Alain Kaloyeros, the nanotech Svengali, at one time New York state's highest-paid public employee, has been found guilty alongside construction bigwig and generous Cuomo donor Lou Ciminelli, of rigging bids in the massive Buffalo Billion program.

Cuomo gave Kaloyeros control over most of the Buffalo Billion scheme, which was supposed to shower upstate with taxpayer dollars and let economic development bloom.

In an effort to stay in favor with King Andrew I, Kaloyeros appears to have worked to make sure that certain preferred builders won major construction contracts; top Albany influence-peddler, Cuomo aide and donor, and Percoco-trial witness Todd Howe was also in the mix.

The project at the center of the Kaloyeros trial was the massive $750 million solar-panel factory that has since been taken over by Elon Musk's Tesla. SolarCity RiverBend was supposed to become the largest manufacturing facility in North America, employing thousands of people and attracting billions of dollars in investment. But now, Tesla is closing solar-panel installation facilities around the country and scaling back its investment in residential solar, leaving the future of the Buffalo plant in doubt. With 600 workers on site, the state subsidy is running better than $1.2 million per job, hardly the kind of ""transformative"" investment that the governor promised.

But that's no surprise, given the history of economic development boondoggles around the state. Spending on economic development has been a demonstrable failure in New York. In 2013, the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission estimated state expenditures on development at roughly $7 billion annually, while we lack ""data to prove the investments are worthwhile."" Indeed, domestic outmigration -- the net loss of residents to other states -- has cost New York almost a million people under Cuomo's time in office. While New York City is doing reasonably well, upstate is in very rough shape, with job growth only one-quarter the national average. And about 90 percent of the net jobs added upstate have been low-wage service-sector positions, not the solid, middle-class employment that we expect from massive economic-development subsidies, which never seem to pay off.

In 2014, New York ""partnered"" with Soraa, a California light-bulb company, to build a $90 million factory outside Syracuse. Soraa promised to bring more than 400 jobs to the region and agreed to rent the facility for $1 annually. Just as the finishing touches were put on the plant, Soraa pulled out of the deal, leaving New York's taxpayers with an empty light-bulb factory.

Doubling down on development deals, Gov. Cuomo announced in 2016 a $600 million investment in a computer chip factory in Utica, to be run by Austrian technology company Ams AG. Six months after a celebrated groundbreaking, Ams cited ""delays"" as their reason for saying goodbye to upstate. The state is ""working tirelessly on potential alternatives"" for the site.

At least the film industry, which gets $420 million in annual tax credits from New York state, goes ahead and makes movies and TV shows here. But all the evidence suggests that they would do so anyway, without the subsidies and that the number of new jobs created by the breaks is minimal. The tax credits, incidentally, are refundable, meaning that the film companies can turn them in for cash if their tax bill is less than the credit is worth. Last year, the state also decided to extend tax credits worth $25 million each to the music and video-game industries, just in case they were thinking about moving.

Most filming takes place in New York City. That's unfair to upstate, so Cuomo launched the infamous Syracuse Film Hub, which was funded with $15 million of public money and built by Cor Development -- whose executive Steve Aiello was convicted of bribery in the Percoco case. ""Hollywood comes to Onondaga!"" exclaimed Cuomo. ""Who would have ever guessed?""

Nobody, as it turned out: The Film Hub was a flop and is now being taken over by Onondaga County, which is hoping to get state money to fund the operating expenses on the mostly empty soundstage.

Desperate to attract jobs to an increasingly depopulated upstate, in 2013 Cuomo launched START-UP NY, a program that created tax-free zones for new companies in certain industries, in depressed areas. After four years of operation, the program has created an estimated 722 new net jobs, ""not even a rounding error in a statewide economy whose 600,000 private firms employ nearly 7.6 million people,"" writes E.J. McMahon of the Empire Center. START-UP NY was rolled out with great fanfare and a $47 million marketing campaign.

In 2010, while the country was in the midst of the financial crisis, Gov. David Paterson wisely ended the practice of legislative ""member items,"" otherwise known as ""earmarks,"" aka ""pork."" But member items came back, in the form of disbursements through the Dormitory Authority (established during World War II in order to build dorms at state teachers' colleges) and its subsidiary State and Municipal Facilities Program. Since 2014, the SMFP has allocated, on behalf of local elected officials, more than $1 billion to all manner of capital projects, from $50,000 for a snowplow for Pitcairn to $25 million for an outlet mall on Staten Island.

At least a snowplow will clear snow. But for what earthly purpose did Cuomo decide, in 2017, to decorate New York City bridges with lights that could be programmed to blink and change color in harmony for an estimated cost of at least $216 million? The ""Harbor of Lights"" plan, mercifully, was shelved, after roughly $6 million was spent on lights for the grand opening of the new Kosciuszko Bridge, to which the governor rolled up in FDR's 1932 Packard limousine. Restoring the car only cost the state $10,000, but Cuomo promises to use it for ""ceremonial opportunities"" and added that President Roosevelt would have wanted it that way: ""Just to leave it sitting here, I don't think it's what FDR would do.""

Then there's the $8 million the governor spent putting up enormous ""I â™¥ NEW YORK"" signs along the state's highways. These signs are so egregious that the federal Department of Transportation ruled them a safety hazard and fined the state $14 million. If New York doesn't take them down by September, that money isn't coming back.

Cuomo hasn't been accused of venality, and there is no indication that he is out to enrich himself personally. But in his efforts to vacuum up as much in the way of campaign contributions, he hasn't let much stand in his way. Despite a 2007 executive order forbidding political appointees from donating to the governor who appointed them, Cuomo has accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from such appointees and hundreds of thousands more from their wives, children and associated business entities. His office has shrugged off suggestions that state government appears to be stocked with individuals who pay for their posts, saying that the original order is inapplicable in most of the cases in question.

And who says no? Though the governor ran for re-election in 2014 promising to sweep out Albany's Augean stables of filth, he shut down his good-government Moreland Commission to Investigate Public Corruption when it took what to him was a wrong turn. When the commission started looking into a state vendor who had donated to Cuomo's campaign, the governor rolled down the gate on its work.

""It's my commission,"" explained the governor, in terms that the Emperor Caligula would have found sympathetic.

""It's my commission,"" explained the governor, in terms that the Emperor Caligula would have found sympathetic. ""My subpoena power, my Moreland Commission. I can appoint it, I can disband it. I appoint you, I can un-appoint you tomorrow . . . It's my commission. I can't 'interfere' with it, because it is mine. It is controlled by me.""

One might hope that a public official would be the slightest bit embarrassed to talk like this. But we are dealing here with the same man who recently vowed to lead a flotilla of pleasure craft to block off-shore drilling, should it be authorized, ""just as Winston Churchill did in Dunkirk .â€‰.â€‰. If you think I'm kidding, I'm not, and I'm going to lead that citizen fleet."" And the same man who, in words that Yogi Berra might have shied from uttering, promised to sue the Supreme Court if it overturns Roe v. Wade.

In a normal political climate, all this foolishness and proximity to heavy-duty corruption would take a toll on the figure atop the Albany totem pole. But this is New York, where graft, self-dealing, no-show jobs for wives and outright theft scarcely raise eyebrows, from Watertown to Water Mill. So Gov. Cuomo can continue to raise millions from millionaires, lie down in the street to protest gun laws in other states and ask crowds of people, ""Do you love me?""

None of this, it appears, will matter very much in September. The latest fundraising numbers show that Governor Cuomo, with a $30 million war chest, has 50 times as much cash-on-hand as Cynthia Nixon. And unlike New York's 14th congressional district, where Joe Crowley was unseated by a scrappy, underfunded underdog, a statewide election requires plenty of money to blanket isolated media markets with non-stop television commercials.

Furthermore, the newest polls have the governor outpacing Nixon by double-digits in every category of registered Democrats, especially among the minority and women she has identified as essential to winning. So with his sole opponent now reduced to calling herself a socialist in order to scrape up support from the grimiest corners of the Democratic Party, it seems like we will have plenty of Cuomo to kick around in the years ahead.

3YZ7A3YHR6BGUR4KUMFYR3FQA2WS5J,Trial Begins Monday for Chicago Officer Accused of Murdering Black Teen,"CHICAGO - The trial of white Chicago policeman Jason Van Dyke, accused of murder in the 2014 shooting of a black teen, was scheduled to begin on Monday in a decisive case for race relations and policing in the third-largest U.S. city.

A soundless dashboard camera video released in 2015 showed police gunning down 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. It spurred protests, fed a national debate over the use of excessive force by police against minorities and led to the ousting of local officials.

The officer, now 40, opted for a jury trial on Friday following the selection of a 12-person jury and five alternate jurors.

The jury of four men and eight women includes seven white persons, three Hispanic people, one black person and one Asian person, based on appearances, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Opening statements were expected later on Monday.

Van Dyke, who was suspended without pay after he was first charged in 2015, pleaded not guilty to murder and has said he felt threatened by McDonald.

McDonald was armed with a knife when he was shot. Van Dyke faces six counts of first-degree murder, 16 counts of aggravated battery - the same number of times prosecutors say McDonald was shot - and one count of official misconduct. Van Dyke is the first Chicago police officer to face a murder charge for an on-duty incident in decades.

The deaths of mostly unarmed black men at hands of police officers across the United States in recent years have led to protests and sometimes violence in major U.S. cities. The killings, some of which were captured on video, helped give rise to the Black Lives Matter movement and became an issue in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.

The video, released by the city more than a year after the shooting in response to a freedom of information lawsuit, sparked days of protests in Chicago. Former Chicago police Superintendent and mayoral hopeful Garry McCarthy was fired, voters ousted the prosecutor who charged Van Dyke, and activists called for the resignation of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

Emanuel said on Sept. 4 he would not seek a third term after facing widespread criticism over his handling of the city's gun violence, a stain on his national political legacy. He did not specifically cite McDonald in his announcement.

A U.S. Department of Justice investigation that began after the video's release found that Chicago police routinely violated people's civil rights, citing excessive force and racially discriminatory conduct.

Three Chicago Police Department officers were indicted in June 2017 for conspiring to cover up McDonald's shooting. They have not yet been tried.

Illinois state judge Vincent Gaughan will oversee the trial in Cook County circuit court.

3VGET1QSZ1HOOCZC2K4WMCW777NW7P,"Accused Russian spy Maria Butina's lawyer: Russia 'doesn't want her back, they want her out'","Robert Driscoll, the lawyer for accused Russian spy Maria Butina, took aim at the Department of Justice on Sunday, telling Fox News exclusively that investigators charged her on technicalities after a lengthy surveillance operation because they didn't want to have to follow her to South Dakota.

Driscoll's remarks came after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday to demand the release of Butina, calling the charges against her ""fabricated,"" according to a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry.

In his first interview since Lavrov's call, Driscoll said that Russia doesn't ""want her back -- they want her out.""

""She's a young woman, who is 29 years old, who just graduated from American [University] with a master's, and she's being held without bond in a D.C. jail on a FARA [Foreign Agents Registration Act] registration charge, and a lot of people look at a young woman like that, and think of their kids,"" Driscoll said.

""Maria has nothing to do with the 12 Russians who were indicted, she has nothing to do with the [Special Counsel Robert] Mueller probe,"" he added. ""They haven't pointed to anything she did that would be remotely spy-like. Spies don't communicate by Twitter direct message.""

RUSSIAN OFFICERS INDICTED FOR ALLEGEDLY HACKING DNC EMAILS

Driscoll played down Butina's texts with her alleged Russian handler, Alexander Torshin, which referred to her ""teachers."" Her attorney told host Leland Vittert that the two were close because of her previous gun-rights advocacy in Moscow.

""To me, it's an overblown case,"" Driscoll said. ""I think Maria circled among people who were involved in U.S. politics, and people got excited when they saw that.""

Driscoll stopped short of saying that Butina's prosecution is a purely political effort, but he charged that it amounts to much ado about a technicality -- and a prosecution that would not have occured if Butina were an American citizen.

FBI agents charged that Butina was getting ready to move to South Dakota to live with her reported boyfriend, conservative political activist Paul Erickson, when they moved in to arrest her.

Driscoll said Butina's connections with high-level officials were overhyped and incidental, and came largely through her relationship with Erickson.

""They haven't charged her with being a Russian agent,"" Driscoll said. ""Everything she's done, according to the government, would be legal if she had filed a piece of paper with the attorney general.""

Butina, a Russian national, was arrested in July and is accused of attempting to infiltrate multiple organizations in the U.S. at the direction of an unnamed senior Kremlin official. She has pleaded not guilty to the allegations but remains in jail as prosecutors argued she could be considered a flight risk.

Butina â€œgained accessâ€ to â€œan extensive network of U.S. persons in positions to influence political activities in the United Statesâ€ by living with and having a personal relationship with another individual,â€ according to court documents.

WATCH: IS BUTINA A RUSSIAN AGENT WHO TRADED SEX FOR SECRETS?

She also allegedly offered sex to someone â€œin exchange for a position within a special interest organization.â€ Court records did not name these people.

The 29-year-old has connections to a longtime GOP operative as well as the National Rifle Association (NRA). She also asked President Trump a question about the United Statesâ€™ relationship with Russia when he was just a presidential candidate.

She was in the U.S. on a student visa, enrolled at American University in Washington, D.C. She received her graduate degree from the university in May.

While Lavrov insisted that Butina be released, there were no signs that the State Department was willing to grant or even acknowledge that request over the weekend.

On Sunday, a State Department statement that recapped Pompeo's call with Lavrov omitted any mention of Butina, focusing instead on Syria policy and the countries' efforts to improve counterterrorism coordination.

""Among the topics discussed was the fact that Russia had violated its commitment in southwest Syria"" the statement read. ""The two also discussed how to implement ideas on counterterrorism process coordination and the mutual goal of establishing business-to-business dialogue between private, non-governmentally controlled entities in each of our two countries.""

3FHTJGYT8OIHXWDCJ1UV0V14DR3PGI,Timeline: President's Donald Trump's rocky road to UK visit,"President Donald Trump will be arriving Thursday in Britain, his first visit since becoming president. He will meet with Prime Minister Theresa May and Queen Elizabeth II before spending the weekend at one of his golf clubs in Scotland. Trump has angered many in Britain in the last two years with a series of actions and pronouncements and many protests are expected.

Here is a look at some of these developments:

January 19, 2016: Britain's lawmakers debate a proposal to ban Trump, a Republican presidential candidate, from Britain. The debate was prompted by a petition signed by roughly half a million people calling for his exclusion after he proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Trump was heavily criticized but there was no vote and no ban was imposed.

May 10, 2016: Newly elected London Mayor Sadiq Khan says Trump's ""ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe"" after Trump suggests that Khan, who is a Muslim, could be an exception to his proposal to ban Muslims from coming to the United States.

January 27, 2017: Theresa May meets with Trump in the Oval Office one week after he was inaugurated and extends an invitation to a state visit that would be hosted by the queen in her role as head of state. May becomes the first foreign leader to meet with the new president.

February 20, 2017: Thousands of anti-Trump protesters rally outside Britain's Parliament while lawmakers inside urge the government to rescind its offer to the president of a state visit stamped with pomp, pageantry and royal approval.

November 29, 2017: Trump angers British leaders by retweeting unverified, anti-Islamic videos from Britain First, whose leaders have since been convicted of hate crimes.

January 12, 2018: Trump cancels a planned visit to London to open the new U.S. Embassy, calling it a bad deal in a poor location.

May 4, 2018: Trump tells an NRA convention in Dallas that Britons are losing the battle against knife crime. ""They don't have guns. They have knives and instead there's blood all over the floors of this hospital. They say it's as bad as a military war zone hospital ... knives, knives, knives."" This claim is rejected by British physicians and lawmakers.

July 5, 2018: The Greater London Authority and the mayor give protesters permission to fly a 20-foot tall balloon depicting Trump as an angry baby in a diaper from Parliament Square for two hours during Trump's July 13 visit.

July 12: 2018: Trump is scheduled to arrive for a three-day visit to the London area and Scotland before flying to Helsinki for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/07/11/timeline-presidents-donald-trumps-rocky-road-to-uk-visit.html,"['Republican', 'Republican', 'Democratic', 'Republican', 'Strongly Democratic']","['2', '5', '4', '1', '1']"

THE LEAD STORY - A SUPREME WAR BEGINS: President Trump hasnâ€™t even announced his Supreme Court nominee and already liberal advocacy groups are pumping millions into campaigns pressuring Republican lawmakers to oppose his pick ... One group at the forefront of these efforts, Demand Justice, has launched what is reported to be a $5 million campaign targeting two moderate GOP senators â€“ Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Demand Justice is led by the former press secretary for Hillary Clintonâ€™s presidential campaign, Brian Fallon, and is one of several groups launching an aggressive push to sway moderate senators of both parties to oppose the eventual nominee.

The Washington Post reported the group's ads were set to start airing Thursday in Murkowski and Collins' home states. They focus on the possibility that Trump's pick to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy could help the court overturn Roe v. Wade, among other major decisions. Fox News reported Thursday that Trump has completed his interviews of Supreme Court candidates after speaking to six judges -- Brett Kavanaugh, Raymond Kethledge, Amy Coney Barrett, Amul Thapar, Joan Larsen and Thomas Hardiman. He is said to be focusing on Kavanaugh, Kethledge and Barrett, and is expected to announce his decision Monday.

TRUMP UNLOADS ON WATERS, WARREN, THE WHOLE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN MONTANA: President Trump held a rally in Montana Thursday night as part of his effort to oust Sen. Jon Tester, one of his most bitter political opponents -- but the president took time to rail against several other big-name critics ... Speaking at the Four Seasons Arena in Great Falls, Trump said ""it's time to retire"" Tester, a red-state Democrat. He added that Democrats ""actually got their ass kicked"" in 2016, drawing raucous applause as he proceeded to unload on such varied targets as The New York Times, Rep. Maxine Waters and Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Trump said he would offer to donate $1 million to Warren's preferred charity if she took the ancestry test. Warren has long been accused of falsely claiming she is of Native American heritage to help in securing jobs, including one as a Harvard law professor. Trump called California Rep. Maxine Waters ""the new leader"" of the Democratic party. ""I said it the other day, yes, [Maxine Waters] is a low-IQ individual. Honestly, she's somewhere in the mid-60s, I believe,"" Trump said.

EPA 'PUNCHLINE': Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruittâ€™s resignation was â€œlong overdue,â€ some lawmakers said as President Trump announced the Cabinet change on Thursday ... Pruitt, 50, and his office, which he led since 2017, had come under fire for extravagant spending habits, including on first-class travel, pay raises to top aides and a $43,000 soundproof booth. In announcing his resignation, Trump said Pruitt had â€œdone an outstanding jobâ€ leading the EPA and â€œwill always be thankful to him for this.â€

However, Pruitt's resignation sparked a variety of responses from lawmakers. â€œScott Pruitt was the worst EPA administrator in the history of the agency. Not only has he acted, time and time again, in an unethical manner, but he has led the agency in exactly the wrong direction,â€ Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a statement. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Trump ""made the right decision"" in accepting the resignation of Pruitt. Sen. Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, said Pruitt made the EPA â€œa punchline.â€

POST-SUMMIT GOALS WITH NORTH KOREA: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in North Korea Friday in his first trip to the region since the historic June 12 nuclear summit in Singapore ... His visit to Pyongyang is his third since April. His high-stakes objective, which analyst Harry Kazianis called his ""Mission: Impossible,"" is to help convert the regime's promises of denuclearization into concrete action that would eliminate the threat posed by Kim Jong Un's nuclear arsenal.

Since the summit, doubts over the secretive regime's intentions have grown again, amid reports it was continuing to expand facilities related to its nuclear and missile programs and that U.S. intelligence was skeptical about its intentions to give up its weapons. However, Pompeo said Friday he expects North Korea will approach future negotiations in good faith.

Harry J. Kazianis: Pompeo's 'Mission: Impossible' -- Is North Korea serious about giving up its nukes? We'll find out soon enough

ON THE BRINK OF ALL-OUT TRADE WAR: When the clock stuck midnight Friday morning, U.S. tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports took effect ... Beijing has vowed to respond immediately in kind, the two biggest economies are on a collision course for a full-blown trade war. Earlier on Friday, China's state media reportedly lashed out at U.S. President Donald Trump, accusing the White House of behaving like a ""gang of hoodlums"" as the deadline approached. Trump has warned that the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, or roughly the total amount that the United States imported from China last year, according to Reuters.

TRAGEDY STRIKES RESCUE MISSION: A former Thai navy SEAL assisting in the rescue efforts to save 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped in a cave has died from lack of oxygen, authorities said ... The volunteer rescuer died during an overnight mission in which he was placing oxygen canisters, SEAL commander Arpakorn Yookongkaew told a news conference Friday morning. He said while underwater, the rescuer passed out and efforts to resuscitate him failed. ""Despite this, we will continue until we accomplish our mission,"" Arpakorn said. Thai authorities are racing to pump out water from a flooded cave where 12 boys and their soccer coach have been trapped since June 23, before more rains are forecast to hit the northern region.

Chip Bergh, CEO of Levi Strauss &amp; Co. since 2011, is partnering with Everytown for Gun Safety in an attempt to push for stricter gun control and regulations.

The company is also partnering with other executives including former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in order to create Everytown Business Leaders for Gun Safety, which Bergh said will be ""a coalition of business leaders who believe, as we do, that business has a critical role to play in and a moral obligation to do something about the gun violence epidemic in this country.""

In a Tuesday op-ed published in Fortune, Bergh wrote that it was important to take a stand against gun violence at such a critical time.

Bergh wrote, ""As business leaders with power in the public and political arenas, we simply cannot stand by silently when it comes to the issues that threaten the very fabric of the communities where we live and work.""

""While taking a stand can be unpopular with some,"" he continued, ""doing nothing is no longer an option.""

According to Bergh's op-ed, the company will set aside $1 million in donations for groups who work to eradicate U.S. gun violence.

""We can't insulate ourselves from every threat,"" Bergh said. ""We can't 'harden' every place we gather -- whether it be our schools, workplaces, shops, churches, or entertainment venues. But we can take common sense, measurable steps like criminal background checks on all gun sales -- that will save lives.""

He added, ""I encourage every CEO and business leader reading this to consider the impact we could make if we stood together alongside the broad coalition of concerned parents, youth, elders, veterans, and community and faith leaders who are committed to shaping a safer path forward.""

In 2016, Bergh -- who is a former military officer -- penned a letter to Levi Strauss consumers asking that they refrain from bringing guns into the company's stores.

""In the days after I published that letter, I received threats to our stores, our business, and even on my life. It was unsettling,"" Bergh revealed. ""But these personal attacks pale in comparison to the threats that activists and survivors from Parkland, Sandy Hook, and daily incidents of gun violence face every time they speak up on this issue.""

In his 2016 letter, Bergh wrote, ""It boils down to this: you shouldn't have to be concerned about your safety while shopping for clothes or trying on a pair of jeans. Simply put, firearms don't belong in either of those settings. In the end, I believe we have an obligation to our employees and customers to ensure a safe environment and keeping firearms out of our stores and offices will get us one step closer to achieving that reality.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/09/06/levi-strauss-teams-up-with-bloomberg-to-create-gun-control-group-simply-cannot-stand-by-silently,"['Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Neutral']","['5', '5', '5', '1', '5']"
3NKW03WTLNPYUU4RYJD2M3D2C23QWF,"Who is Maria Butina, the Russian woman accused of spying on US?","A 29-year-old Russian woman accused of working as a covert spy while in the U.S. on a student visa remains behind bars.

Maria Butina, a Russian national, was arrested in July and is accused of attempting to infiltrate multiple organizations in the U.S. at the direction of an unnamed senior Kremlin official. She has pleaded not guilty to the allegations but remains in jail as prosecutors argued she could be considered a flight risk.

Butina has connections to a longtime GOP operative as well as the National Rifle Association (NRA). She also asked President Trump a question about the United Statesâ€™ relationship with Russia when he was just a presidential candidate.

Read on for a summary of Butina and the allegations against her.

So who is she?

Butina is a suspected covert Russian spy. She is a Russian national who was in the U.S. on a student visa, enrolled at American University in Washington, D.C. She received her graduate degree from the university in May.

She's known for her pro-gun activism and founded a Russian gun rights group in Moscow.

The 29-year-old grew up in a modest apartment building in the Siberian city of Barnaul, closer to the Mongolian and Kazakh borders than Moscow.

She developed an interest in high-level politics after she attended a special camp for young political hopefuls run by the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, Konstantin Emeshin, founder of the School of Real Politics in Barnaul, told The Associated Press. Butina received her first degree from that school.

Why was she arrested?

Butina was arrested on July 15 on suspicions she was in the U.S. acting as a covert foreign agent for Russia. She is accused of attempting to infiltrate multiple organizations in the U.S. at the direction of an unnamed senior Kremlin official in a years-long campaign.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

She â€œgained accessâ€ to â€œan extensive network of U.S. persons in positions to influence political activities in the United Statesâ€ by living with and having a personal relationship with another individual,â€ according to court documents.

She also allegedly offered sex to someone â€œin exchange for a position within a special interest organization.â€ Court records did not name these people.

Prosecutors said the FBI has evidence Butina has corresponded with Russian intelligence operatives. She also had contact information of people involved with Russiaâ€™s FSB, the main successor agency to the former KGB, prosecutors said.

Butina was compared to Anna Chapman, the Russian spy who was arrested in 2010 and eventually deported, by Russian officials in text messages, prosecutors added.

WHO HAS BEEN CHARGED IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION SO FAR?

Her arrest is not part of Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation into Russian collusion in the 2016 election and potential collaboration with the Trump campaign.

What is her connection to Republicans?

Butina accompanied Paul Erickson, a longtime Republican operative, to Trumpâ€™s inauguration in January 2017.

Butina once asked Trump, then a presidential candidate, about his foreign policy platform, particularly how he would view a relationship between Russia and the U.S. if elected. She was able to ask him a question during a 2015 town hall.

â€œI believe I would get along very nicely with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,â€ Trump told her.

She met Donald Trump Jr., the presidentâ€™s eldest son, at a 2016 NRA convention, The Washington Post reported.

RUSSIAN WOMAN LINKED TO GUN-RIGHTS GROUPS CHARGED WITH ACTING AS COVERT AGENT IN US

She regularly interacted with members of the NRA and attended events and conventions, according to a court affidavit. She also hosted NRA executives and gun activists in Moscow, including one delegation that included former Sheriff David Clarke of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin.

She was also photographed with Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., while at an NRA meeting in 2015 in Tennessee. Walker denied having an actual sit-down meeting with Butina.

â€œAs we go to events, we meet people, they introduce themselves, often they ask for a picture,â€ Walker told reporters, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. â€œAnd thatâ€™s not a meeting. A meeting is where you sit down in a room and have a discussion.â€

Sheâ€™s also been photographed with former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum.

Whatâ€™s going on with her case now?

Butina pleaded not guilty on July 18, but she remains in prison awaiting trial. Prosecutors said Butina appeared to have plans to leave Washington, D.C. at the time of her arrest â€” as her possessions were packed away in boxes and the lease on her apartment was nearly up.

Her attorney, Robert Driscoll, has denied Butina is a spy and said sheâ€™s just a â€œyoung student seeking to make her way in America.â€

Consular officials plan to meet with Butina in jail, the Russian Embassy said in a Facebook post.

33P2GD6NROAUM1B7QF75PER6YHAKHB,"NRA, Second Amendment Foundation file lawsuit over Seattle's new safe storage requirement for guns","The City of Seattle's new ""safe storage"" gun requirement has prompted the Second Amendment Foundation and NRA to file a lawsuit that claims it violates the state's pre-emption statute, KOMO-TV reported.

Alan Gottlieb, SAF founder and executive vice president, said in the report that it appears Seattle is once again trying to pass its own gun laws.

""Seattle seems to think it should be treated differently than any other local government when it comes to firearm regulation,"" Gottlieb told the news outlet. ""We should not have to repeatedly remind Seattle that they are still part of Washington state and must obey the law.""

Two Seattle residents, both gun owners, are supporting the lawsuit, according to the report.

The lawsuit names Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, the Seattle Police Department and Police Chief Carmen Best.

""While they go to court, kids go to the hospital,"" Durkan said. ""We can't prevent every gun death or injury. We can take steps to help prevent tragedies. I am grateful that legal experts who share our commitment to reducing gun violence are standing with us and standing up for safer communities.""

""We will prevail and will continue to push for more protection for our children,"" Durkan added.

The mayor also wrote on Twitter that the lawsuit will not cause her to be intimidated.

The gun storage requirement was passed earlier this year and is set to go into effect in January. It carries fines of up to $10,000 or more if gun owners fail to meet safe storage requirements. The biggest fine is linked to a minor using an unsecured firearm to commit a crime.

The report outlines some of the changes:

The lawsuit maintains that state law bars cities, towns, counties, and other municipalities from approving gun regulations that exceed the state's authority.

""The state legislature has sole authority to adopt gun laws including, but not limited to, registration, licensing, possession, purchase, sale, acquisition, transfer, discharge and transportation of firearms,"" the SAF stated in a press release announcing the suit.

Seattle's ordinance came in response to a University of Washington study that claimed nearly 2-in-3 gun-owning households in the state do not safely store their firearms, according to the report.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/07/22/nra-second-amendment-foundation-file-lawsuit-over-seattles-new-safe-storage-requirement-for-guns,"['Neutral', 'Strongly Republican', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Republican']","['5', '5', '5', '5', '5']"
3V8JSVE8YZ8DMW9M4T0QDJ9442REYS,Kremlin Launches Twitter Flash Mob To Free Alleged Russian Agent Maria Butina,"STR via Getty Images Maria Butina speaks on Oct. 8, 2013, during a press conference in Moscow. U.S. prosecutors accuse her of working covertly for the Kremlin.

Russiaâ€™s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has launched a Twitter flash mob to free Russian national Maria Butina following U.S. charges that she conspired to influence American politics while covertly working for the Kremlin.

Itâ€™s an intriguing strategy by a foreign government, though perhaps not surprising, given the U.S. intelligence finding that the Kremlin manipulated social media during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The ministry urged people to show support for Butina by changing their Twitter profile photos to a portrait of Butina posted on the ministryâ€™s official Twitter account and Facebook page on Thursday. Those pages feature an image of Butina, 29, with the hashtag #FreeMariaButina beneath.

â€œIn connection with the arrest in the United States of Russian citizen Maria Butina, weâ€™re starting a flashmob in her support: #FreeMariaButina,â€ reads the translated Tweet. â€œPut a photo of Maria as your avatar.â€

The English version of the ministryâ€™s Twitter account simply announced #NewProfilePic and #FreeMariaButina.

By late Thursday, it appeared that no one who had responded in Russian to the Russian Twitter account had changed their profile photo. Responses in English were harsh.

Unbelievable. Russian ministry of foreign affairs changes its profile photo to #FreeMariaButina. This is war. You realise this, right? It's a troll war. But it's still war. It's what war looks like now. pic.twitter.com/9qEREECTJr â€” Carole Cadwalladr (@carolecadwalla) July 19, 2018

U.S. prosecutors say Butina cultivated contacts she made at a â€œgun rights organizationâ€ that fits the description of the National Rifle Association to get close to politicians. She â€œgained accessâ€ through one unidentified American with whom she was cohabiting to an â€œextensive networkâ€ of people in â€œpositions to influence political activities in the United States,â€ according to court documents.

According to reporting by Rolling Stone and Mother Jones, Butinaâ€™s key American contact was likely South Dakota Republican Paul Erickson, 56, who reached out to Trump campaign leaders in a bid to establish a â€œback channelâ€ between the campaign and the Kremlin, according to The New York Times.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-free-maria-butina_us_5b510c2fe4b0fd5c73c3a921,"['Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Democratic', 'Democratic']","['5', '4', '1', '2', '1']"
34KYK9TV2SQIJ7LTVW6BUPFIKBASB2,DeVos considering allowing states to use federal funds to buy guns: report,"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is reportedly considering allowing states to use federal funds to buy firearms for educators.

The New York Times, citing multiple people with knowledge of the plan, reported Wednesday evening that the department is focusing on a federal education law that does not explicitly prohibit the purchase of firearms through federal funds called the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants.

It would be up to DeVos to approve of any such measure, The Times reported.

The Department of Education did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News.

A spokeswoman for the education department told the paper that the agency is â€œconstantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety,â€ but did not specifically address whether the department is considering granting states the option to use federal funds for weapons purchases.

â€œThe secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios,â€ the spokeswoman said.

Former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords -- who was injured during a 2011 shooting at a meet-and-greet event in Tuscon, Az. â€“ said arming teachers puts â€œchildren in even more danger.â€

â€œArming teachers is not a solution. It recklessly puts American children in even more danger,â€ Giffords tweeted late Wednesday evening. â€œWe can forge a better path. Itâ€™s time for Americans to find the courage to fight for our own safety.â€

Stricter gun control laws have been at the forefront of hotly debated topics in Washington since a gunman opened fire at a high school in Parkland, Florida, and killed 17 students and faculty members.

President Trump in February expressed his support for arming â€œgun adept teachers with military or special training experience,â€ as a way to prevent another â€œsavage sickoâ€ from causing mass causalities.

He also advocated for gun control measures, such as raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21.

DeVos unveiled a federal commission on school safety in March to study whether to ban gun sales to people under 21, among other things.",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/23/devos-considering-allowing-states-to-use-federal-funds-to-buy-guns-report.html,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Republican', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['5', '5', '5', '5', '5']"
3W0KKJIARSR1TQAENBDZC1Y7VKKK84,"Second day of Kavanaugh hearings erupts into tense cross-examination on Mueller, racial profiling","Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing boiled over into a series of tense exchanges late in the evening Wednesday, as high-profile Democrats lined up to hammer the appellate judge with thinly veiled accusations that he was hiding ties to President Trump's inner circle and harbored sympathies for racist policies.

In an especially combative moment late in the day, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., pointedly asked Kavanaugh whether he ever had discussed Special Counsel Robert Mueller or his Russia probe with anyone at Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by Marc Kasowitz, a former personal attorney to President Trump.

""Be sure about your answer,"" Harris warned. ""I'm asking you a very direct question. Yes or no?""

""I'm not sure I know everyone who works at that law firm,"" Kavanaugh said. ""I'm not remembering, but I'm happy to be refreshed.""

""How can you not remember whether or not you had a conversation about Robert Mueller or his investigation with anyone at that law firm?"" Harris asked, visibly exasperated. ""This investigation has only been going on for so long, sir, so please answer the question.""

""I'm just trying to think -- do I know anyone who works at that firm?"" Kavanaugh eventually replied. ""I'd like to know the person you're thinking of.""

""I think you're thinking of someone and you don't want to tell us,"" Harris shot back, sending the room into a few seconds of near-total silence.

Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee then interjected briefly to defend Kavanaugh, saying that ""this town is full of law firms"" and that they ""are constantly metastasizing, they break off, they form new firms -- they're like rabbits. There's no possible way we can expect this witness to know who populates an entire firm.""

According to the firm's website, Kasowitz employs more than 250 attorneys, not including dozens of staff members.

A barrage of protesters erupted in a chant of ""Answer the question"" before being led out by police as Lee spoke. In all, 73 people were arrested and charged for unlawful demonstrations within Senate buildings on Wednesday, including 66 people who were removed from the hearing room during the day, according to Capitol Police officials.

In another dramatic exchange, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., implied Kavanaugh had been open to racial profiling tactics, citing an email exchange between Kavanaugh and a colleague. However, Booker did not provide Kavanaugh a copy of the emails to review while questioning him about it, prompting another objection from Lee, who charged that it was inappropriate to ""cross-examine"" Kavanaugh about documents that he ""can't see.""

Booker countered that when Democrats received the emails, which he said were titled ""racial profiling,"" they were marked ""committee confidential,"" indicating that they contained sensitive information.

""The system is rigged,"" Booker said, arguing that the documents should not have been marked confidential, because they did not contain personal or national security information. ""The process is unfair, unnecessary, unjust, and unprecedented on this committee.""

Lee ultimately agreed that the emails should be released, but that Kavanaugh should still be able to review them: ""There's no reason why this shouldn't be something we can't discuss in public -- I don't know why it was marked 'committee confidential,'"" he said.

The emails, released later Thursday, showed Kavanaugh advocating for race-neutral security screening policies at airports in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, although he said that during an ""interim"" period before such policies could be implemented, administration lawyers would need to ""grapple"" with the possibility considering race during screening in the interests of national security.

Also Wednesday evening, Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono pressed Kavanaugh at length about whether he was aware of inappropriate behavior by former 9th Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski when he clerked for Kozinski from 1991 to 1992. Kozinski abruptly retired last year after several woman who had worked as law clerks or colleagues accused him of sexual misconduct that included touching, inappropriate sexual comments and forced viewings of pornography in his chambers.

Hirono, who repeatedly has asked other judicial nominees whether they ever sexually harassed anyone, noted that Kavanaugh and Kozinski had kept in touch after his clerkship, with Kozinski recommending Kavanaugh during his 2006 confirmation hearings for his current job on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

""You saw nothing, you heard nothing, and you obviously said nothing,"" Hirono said, even as Kavanaugh denied being aware of any misconduct by Kozinski and said he would have reported it if he had known.

""I'm sorry about the circumstances, but we'll get through it."" - Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.

For the most part, the lengthy hearing focused on Kavanaugh's writings and, in particular, key opinions he authored while serving on the nation's most prestigious appellate court.

At one point, Kavanaugh was asked by Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy about the constitutionality of individual federal judges issuing nationwide injunctions against presidential action -- a phenomenon that has attracted scrutiny after district court judges unilaterally brought temporary halts to President Trump's travel ban and other initiatives. Kavanaugh demurred, saying he could not discuss potential pending issues before the Supreme Court.

After Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse decried what he said was the improper mixing of partisan politics with legal discussion during the hearing, he reiterated his arguments from Tuesday that Congress often delegates excessive authority to mostly unaccountable executive branch agencies.

WATCH: SASSE UNLOADS ON CONGRESS DURING CONFIRMATION HEARING

In response, Kavanaugh specifically touched on the Obama-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), saying that even if the agency was a good policy idea, its creation was an improper ""departure from historical practice"" because it employed a single director, rather than a committee, who could only be removed by the president for cause.

Kavanaugh wrote an opinion for a three-judge panel striking down the CFPB's structure as unconstitutional in 2016, but was later reversed in part by a 7-3 vote in an unusual en banc review by other justices on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The en banc review found the CFPB's structure to be constitutional, but agreed with Kavanaugh that one of the agency's major interpretive decisions had improperly violated due process requirements.

""A single person can make these enormous decisions?"" Kavanaugh told Sasse on Wednesday, referring to the director of the CFPB. ""From my perspective ... that was an issue of concern.""

The confirmation hearing has been chaotic at times, with Democrats trying to delay the proceedings as they complain they haven't received enough records from Kavanaugh's past work.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell found a way to allow Wednesdayâ€™s confirmation hearing to continue into the night, after a brief floor clash with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Schumer had objected to McConnellâ€™s request for the committee to continue meeting after 2 p.m., despite plans to go late. But McConnell, using a parliamentary maneuver, adjourned the Senate for the day -- because committees can meet as long as they like when the Senate is not in session.

KAVANAUGH VOWS TO 'KEEP AN OPEN MIND IN EVERY CASE'

California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committeeâ€™s ranking member and the first Democrat to question the nominee, began her questioning of Kavanaugh by referencing the outbursts from protesters: â€œI'm sorry about the circumstances, but we'll get through it,â€ she said.

Feinstein asked the nominee about his past case argument that Washington D.C.â€™s assault weapons ban was unconstitutional. He said he was following the precedent of the Supreme Court, but acknowledged that gun violence posed significant policy concerns.

In his 2011 dissent in a follow-up to the landmark D.C. v. Heller case, Kavanaugh wrote that based on Supreme Court precedent, gun restrictions should be assessed principally by reviewing ""text, history, and tradition,"" rather than a balancing analysis that mainly considers dangers to the public and the government's interest in regulation.

Kavanaugh wrote that there is ""no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction"" between semiautomatic rifles and semiautomatic handguns, rejecting the city's attempt to apply regulations to rifles, other than automatics, that could not constitutionally apply to handguns.

Feinstein also pressed Kavanaugh over the Roe v. Wade court decision regarding abortion. â€œWell, as a general proposition, I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade,â€ he said.

Later in the day, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., dismissed Kavanaugh's statements on Roe, saying that describing the case as important ""existing Supreme Court precedent"" was akin to callously introducing a woman as ""my current wife,"" drawing a slight grin from Kavanaugh.

The nominee then stressed that ""precedent on precedent"" has since supported abortion rights, noting that the 1992 Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey explicitly upheld Roe. But when pointedly asked by Blumenthal to vow to never overturn Roe, Kavanaugh reiterated that it would be inappropriate for nominees to the Supreme Court to discuss hypothetical cases during their confirmation hearings -- a view echoed by each sitting Supreme Court justice.

It was a recurring theme for Kavanaugh on the day, as he emphasized that he would remain an impartial jurist despite his personal views, both before and after the confirmation hearings. To argue that he can be trusted to be fair to all litigants, Kavanaugh cited his decision in the 2012 case Hamdan v. United States, in which he overturned the conviction of Osama bin Laden's personal driver, Salim Hamdan. The conviction, Kavanaugh said, violated the Constitution's Ex Post Facto provision by punishing a defendant under a system of military tribunals enacted after his alleged crimes.

â€œYou'll never have a nominee who's ruled for a more unpopular defendant,"" Kavanaugh told senators Wednesday, saying that while Hamdan was a widely reviled Guantanamo Bay detainee, he was still entitled to some constitutional protections.

Feinstein also asked Kavanaugh about past comments regarding investigations involving a president, a key issue amid the Russia probe that has implicated numerous Trump associates. Kavanaugh said heâ€™s never taken a position on the constitutionality of whether a president should be investigated while in office.

In response to later questions from Sasse, Kavanaugh emphasized that ""no one's above the law,"" saying that while any criminal prosecution of a sitting president may face ""timing"" issues, there is no absolute constitutional prohibition against eventually pursuing such a prosecution.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., pressed Kavanaugh about what he knew about the Bush administrationâ€™s warrantless surveillance program. Leahy also asked Kavanaugh if a president has a right to pardon himself, a power President Trump has said he believes he has.

â€œThe question of self-pardons is something I have never analyzed,â€ Kavanaugh replied.

Outbursts from protesters have been a recurring feature since the hearings began. Moments after Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley opened the hearing Wednesday, shouting could be heard from the back of the room: â€œSham president, sham justice!â€ Ironically, at one point, protesters shouted as Kavanaugh discussed how he tried to be respectful in court. ""Iâ€™ve tried to be a very collegial judge, Iâ€™ve tried to be civil,"" he said.

Kavanaugh served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office in the George W. Bush administration. He also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.

Kavanaugh's elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court, raising the stakes beyond those of last year's nomination of Neil Gorsuch.

The judge's nomination, though, will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators, including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee.

Republicans command a narrow 51-49 Senate majority. Party leaders have said they hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by a floor vote by early October, when the next Supreme Court term begins.

3ABAOCJ4R9M2PIADUH7FD5BBE91MQE,At least four people killed in Canada shooting: police,"TORONTO (Reuters) - At least four people were killed in a shooting incident in the eastern Canadian city of Fredericton, police said on Friday.

The Fredericton police said in a post on Twitter the incident was ongoing and there were multiple fatalities. The police urged people to stay inside and lock doors.

In 2014, another mass shooting in New Brunswick led to the deaths of three Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers and the wounding of two more in Moncton. At the time, the incident was one of the worst of its kind in Canada, where gun laws are stricter than they are in the United States and deadly attacks on police are rare. But a proliferation of weapons has led to an increase in gun crimes in recent years.

Last month, a gunman walked down a busy Toronto street, killing two people and wounding 13 before turning his gun on himself.

On Thursday, Ontario pledged more money for police and to keep suspects behind bars while they await trial on gun crimes charges, as the Canadian province grapples with rising shootings involving domestically obtained weapons.

Watts is the founder of Michael Bloomberg-funded Moms Demand Action.

Earlier Sunday Breitbart News reported on a shooting at a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida.

At approximately 3 pm ET Watts tweeted:

Gun violence is political because lobbyists pay our politicians for their inaction. Gun violence is a uniquely American crisis for that reason. Don't bother tweeting me ""It's too soon to talk about our nation's lax gun laws."" For the Jacksonville victims, it's too late. https://t.co/sH2FJ2MdCb â€” Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) August 26, 2018

Her tweet came minutes after the Jacksonville Sheriffâ€™s Office tweeted that a suspect in the shooting was dead, but before they had confirmed whether that suspect acted alone or how many injuries and fatalities there were.

In fact, Watts tweet was sent while SWAT Teams were still sweeping the area around where the shooting occurred to be sure everything was clear:

We are finding many people hiding in locked areas at The Landing. We ask you to stay calm, stay where you are hiding. SWAT is doing a methodical search inside The Landing. We will get to you.

3IVEC1GSLQHO76KB6548WCBM2PF1J3,Second suspect convicted in killing of Chicago honor student,"A suspect who claimed he was forced to kill a 15-year-old high school honor student in Chicago's South Side in 2013 was convicted Thursday of first-degree murder.

The jury concluded that Micheail Ward was guilty of firing the fatal shot that struck Hadiya Pendleton in the back, the Chicago Tribune reported.

The verdict -- in a case that drew national attention and came to symbolize Chicago's rampant gun violence -- brought a sense of relief to Pendletonâ€™s family.

""There is justice for Hadiya,"" Pendletonâ€™s mother, Cleopatra Cowley, said after the verdict was delivered. ""She did not deserve what happened to her.""

""There is justice for Hadiya. She did not deserve what happened to her."" - Cleopatra Cowley, mother of slain honor student Hadiya Pendleton

On Wednesday, a separate jury found the man accused of driving the getaway car, Kenneth Williams, guilty of first-degree murder.

During the trial, jurors watched a video in which Ward confessed to killing Pendleton in a South Side park. Pendleton had recently returned from Washington, where she performed as a majorette with her high school band at President Barack Obama's second inauguration.

Ward said Williams would kill him if he didnâ€™t open fire, because he believed Pendleton and her group of friends were a rival gang. Ward said he got out of the car he and Williams were in and walked over to a fence and opened fire on the group.

Wardâ€™s mother insisted her son, who was 18 at the time of Pendletonâ€™s death, is innocent and was coerced by Chicago police detectives into confessing, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

â€œIâ€™m disappointed in our criminal system,â€ she said following Thursdayâ€™s verdict. â€œIâ€™m disappointed by how they just harassed these kids into a confession.â€

Despite being one of 3,000 deaths that year, Pendletonâ€™s murder drew national attention when it was mentioned by President Obama during his 2013 State of the Union address. The killing, which happened within a mile of the Obamas' Chicago home, prompted Michelle Obama to attend Pendletonâ€™s funeral.

â€œHadiya Pendleton was me, and I was her,â€ the first lady told an audience afterward.

3I6NF2WGIHED4MVTZMLH2PWNM4U5GU,"Russia says Putin, Trump discussed referendum in Ukraine","MOSCOW (AP) â€” President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed a possible referendum in separatist-leaning eastern Ukraine during their Helsinki summit earlier this week, Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the U.S. said Friday.

Ambassador Anatoly Antonov revealed the discussions amid confusion and concern in the U.S. about what the two presidents agreed behind closed doors.

â€œThis issue (of a referendum) was discussed,â€ he said, adding without elaborating that Putin made â€œconcrete proposalsâ€ to Trump on solutions for the four-year Ukraine conflict, which has killed more than 10,000 people.

The move may be seen as an effort to sidestep European peace efforts for Ukraine and increase pressure on the Ukrainian government in its protracted conflict with pro-Russian separatists in the Donbass region.

Trump tweeted that the two men discussed Ukraine, but has not mentioned a referendum or revealed specifics. The U.S. and Russia have been on opposing sides of the conflict in Ukraine, unleashed after a popular uprising against a pro-Russian president and Russiaâ€™s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Ukraine and European powers did not immediately comment Friday, but are not expected to support a referendum in the Donbass, where pro-Russian separatists hold sway. They have been committed to a 2015 peace deal signed in the Belarusian capital of Minsk that has helped reduce the fighting but failed to find a lasting political solution.

Putin has sought to ally with Trump at a time when U.S. ties to Europe are fraying, and both presidents are critical of the EU and NATO. German Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed back Friday at Trumpâ€™s questioning of NATOâ€™s central tenet of collective defense.

Ambassador Antonov called Mondayâ€™s summit in Helsinki a â€œkey eventâ€ in international politics and laughed off suggestions that the two men made any â€œsecret deals.â€

Antonov insisted that diplomatic discussions should remain discreet in order to be effective, but gave a few details of their discussions on arms control and said the summit notably made progress on U.S.-Russian cooperation on Syriaâ€™s future.

He also said Moscow is ready to discuss a possible visit by Putin to Washington after a surprise invitation from Trump.

Antonov said itâ€™s important to â€œdeal with the resultsâ€ of their first summit before jumping too fast into a new one, but that â€œRussia was always open to such proposals. We are ready for discussions on this subject.â€

The Kremlin has the final say, but hasnâ€™t responded yet to the proposal Trump made Thursday.

The Russian ambassador to Washington also denounced â€œanti-Russian angerâ€ in the United States and the â€œseverityâ€ of the U.S. criticism of Trumpâ€™s performance at the summit.

He reiterated denials of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election â€” interrupting a questioner to say â€œWe didnâ€™t interfere!â€ He also reiterated denials of Russian involvement in the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Britain.

Meanwhile, Antonov also pushed for the release of a gun rights activist accused of being a covert agent in the U.S., calling her arrest a â€œfarce.â€

U.S. federal prosecutors accused Maria Butina this week of being a covert Russian agent and working to infiltrate U.S. political organizations, including the National Rifle Association, before and after Donald Trumpâ€™s election as president.

Butina, 29, denies wrongdoing, and the Russian Foreign Ministry started an online campaign for her release.

3W31J70BATE35T0R4NT4ENUQLP5KC2,Vermont primary - LIVE: Democrat Christine Hallquist vying to become America's first transgender governor,"Numerous unique candidates are competing for power in Vermont's primaries ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, as voters head to the polls on Tuesday.

Phil Scott, the Republican governor in the reliably Democratic state, is running for re-election despite growing concerns from the right surrounding his stance on gun control. After passing a series of measures tightening gun restrictions in Vermont, guns rights groups like the Gun Owners of Vermont launched a campaign calling on voters to write-in other conservative candidates, including Keith Stern and John Rodgers.

If he loses the support of his base, Mr Scott's seat could very well go to one of four Democrat candidates.

Ethan Sonneborn is one of those candidates. He's a 14-year-old progressive who decided to launch his campaign after violence erupted last year during a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, North Carolina. State law allows anyone who has lived in Vermont for four years to run for governor after securing enough signatures to get on the ballot, making Mr Sonneborn legally qualified despite his age.

While his campaign has only raised a reported $1,700, other progressive candidates appear to be viable contenders for the governor's mansion. Christine Hallquist, a transgender woman and former executive of the Vermont Electric Co-Operative, would be the first transgender gubernatorial candidate from a major political party if she were to win the Democratic nomination.

She's ran on a platform of addressing local and state issues, from rural economic development to climate change, and has described her gender as just one of many defining traits.

And, of course, there's Bernie Sanders. Vermont's current senator is also seeking re-election as an independent, and will reject the Democratic party's nomination if he wins it -- as he had done since 2006.

36QZ6V158AVXF6UZVNN6ZF769ADSU7,"Clinton, Sanders, Warren to headline American Federation of Teachers convention in Pittsburgh","Big-name Democrats will join thousands of educators in Pittsburgh this weekend when the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) holds its biennial convention.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are among the scheduled speakers for the event, which will begin Friday, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.

Members of the National Education Association, which supported Clintonâ€™s failed presidential bid in 2016, will be present as well.

The convention comes two weeks after the Supreme Court reversed a decades-old policy of public labor unions compelling public-sector workers to pay dues.

Under the 5-4 ruling in Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), public-sector employees may now opt out of having union dues payments deducted from their paychecks, the Washington Examiner reported.

The ruling was widely bemoaned by advocates of organized labor, including AFT President Randi Weingarten.

â€œWe are at this solemn and scary inflection point in our country where there are really troubling trends and amazing activism at the same time,â€ Weingarten said Tuesday, according to the Examiner.

She noted that membership in the AFT has skyrocketed because of a strategy implemented before the Supreme Court ruling.

The AFT, which represents 1.7 million teachers, has 3,000 affiliates throughout the country, making it the nation's largest teacher union.

The AFT has made news this year for promoting student and teacher protests following February's school shooting in Parkland, Fla.; cutting ties with Wells Fargo after the bank refused to end its relationships with the National Rifle Association and gun makers; backing teacher strikes in West Virginia and other states, and opposing visas for hiring foreign teachers.

The convention will take place in downtown Pittsburgh at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center.

Earlier this year, thousands of teachers in West Virginia, Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma and Kentucky walked off their jobs, demanding pay raises and more funding for their classrooms.",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/11/clinton-sanders-warren-to-headline-american-federation-teachers-convention-in-pittsburgh.html,"['Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Democratic']","['1', '5', '1', '1', '1']"
3UY4PIS8QS3KQWBWL3W0PJS3BNJN1K,NRA Launches TV Ad Supporting Brett Kavanaugh for Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON, DC â€“ The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) has launched a massive ad buy on television for â€œThe Deciding Vote,â€ a commercial supporting Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, reminding millions of American gun owners that the fate of the Second Amendment could turn on whether the Senate confirms Kavanaugh to the nationâ€™s highest court.

â€œLet me ask you a simple question. Do you believe you have a right to defend yourself and your family with a firearm in your own home?â€ begins Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRAâ€™s political arm. â€œFour Supreme Court justices say you do, but four say you donâ€™t â€¦ because the deciding vote announced heâ€™s retiring.â€

â€œAnd your most fundamental right to self-defense could be extinguished,â€ he warns:

Cox is referring to the fact that District of Columbia v. Hellerâ€“ the historic case that held in 2008 that the Second Amendment is an individual right for U.S. citizens â€“ was a 5-4 decision. Four justices insisted in dissent that the Second Amendment does not apply to private citizens at all, and thus, the government can completely ban all gun ownership.

Justice Anthony Kennedy was one of the five justices in the majority, meaning a replacement who is not committed to gun rights could become a fifth vote to overrule Heller, even though approximately 80 percent of Americans believe they have a constitutional right to own firearms.

â€œThis is our opportunity to protect the one freedom and guarantees all the others,â€ Cox continues, â€œthe freedom that makes America different from every other country on earth.â€

â€œThe Second Amendment is at stake,â€ he adds. â€œAmerica is at stake.â€

â€œWe donâ€™t care if weâ€™re the last one in the arena. We will never, ever stop fighting for this freedom,â€ Cox promises the audience. â€œWe are the National Rifle Association of America, and we are freedomâ€™s safest place.â€

3909MD9T20Z7M5SRZ382OY2OYTNEFL,Fake News: Mic's Emily Singer Detects Alleged Russian Spy in Oval Office,"Emily Singer, a senior political reporter for Mic.com, set off a mini Red Scare Tuesday morning by suggesting a White House staffer pictured in the Oval Office was actually an alleged Russian spy â€” then scrubbed the quickly debunked claim from her verified Twitter account.

Singer shared a photo of President Donald Trump hosting a group of top Russia officials at the White House on May 10, 2017, including then-Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov â€” seen in a New York Times story covering that meeting â€” and zeroed in on a red-headed woman in the door of the Oval Office.

â€œI thought this was a photoshop, but itâ€™s not. This is Maria Butina â€” arrested for being a Russian spy â€” in the Oval Office with Trump,â€ Singer tweeted , attaching a photo of the president with the Russia delegation.

Singer soon after expressed doubt over whether she correctly identified Butina in the photo, conceding that it â€œmay be Cari Lutkins,â€ a member of the White House National Security Council. â€œI may delete this tweet,â€ Singer told her 20,000 Twitter followers.

Federal prosecutors in Washington revealed Monday that they arrested the 29-year-old Maria Butina and accused her of working as a covert Russian agent, gathering intelligence on American officials and political organizations through her gun-rights contacts.

The announcement of the arrest of Butina came just hours after President Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and just days after special counsel Robert Mueller charged 12 Russian intelligence officials with directing a sprawling hacking effort aimed at swaying the 2016 election.

Mueller did not file the charge against Butina, but court papers show that her activities revolved around American politics during the 2016 campaign and included efforts to use contacts with the National Rifle Association and American politicians to gather intelligence for Russia.

Court papers also reveal that an unnamed American who worked with Butina claimed to have been involved in setting up a â€œprivate line of communicationâ€ ahead of the 2016 election between the Kremlin and â€œkeyâ€ officials in an American political party through the NRA. The court papers do not name the political party mentioned in the October 2016 message, but they contain details that appear to refer to the Republican Party.

Butina, a Russian national who has been living the U.S., was charged with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of the Russian government. A federal judge in Washington ordered her detained until a hearing set for Wednesday, according to a statement from the Justice Department and Jessie Liu, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.

In a statement, Butinaâ€™s attorney, Robert Driscoll, called the allegations â€œoverblownâ€ and said prosecutors had criminalized mundane networking opportunities. Driscoll said Butina was not an agent of the Russian Federation but was instead in the U.S. on a student visa, graduating from American University with a masterâ€™s degree in international relations.

â€œThere is simply no indication of Ms. Butina seeking to influence or undermine any specific policy or law or the United States â€” only at most to promote a better relationship between the two nations,â€ Driscoll said in a statement. â€œThe complaint is simply a misuse of the Foreign Agent statute, which is designed to punish covert propaganda, not open and public networking by foreign students.â€

3K1H3NEY7MH88ZAMES3001KFZLSDGA,"3D-printed gun blueprints can be downloaded starting next month, ending lengthy legal battle","Blueprints for 3D-printed guns can be downloaded starting next month, following a landmark Department of Justice settlement with Second Amendment advocates.

Defense Distributed, a non-profit defense firm, will offer the blueprints for download starting Aug. 1 following a multiyear legal battle with the federal government.

â€œItâ€™s personally satisfying,â€ Defense Distributed director Cody Wilson told Fox News, adding Americaâ€™s gun culture has been â€œguaranteed safe passageâ€ into the modern era.

ARMY'S NEW MACHINE GUN WILL BLAST LIKE BATTLE TANKS

Defense Distributed and the Second Amendment Foundation were co-plaintiffs in a 2015 lawsuit against the government, which had forced Wilsonâ€™s firm to take blueprints for the â€œLiberatorâ€ 3D-printed gun off its website. More than 100,000 copies of the controversial blueprint were downloaded before the governmentâ€™s clampdown.

The settlement paves the way for Defense Distributed to again offer the Liberator files, and others for 3D-printed guns, on its website. â€œUnder terms of the settlement, the government has agreed to waive its prior restraint against the plaintiffs, allowing them to freely publish the 3-D files and other information at issue,â€ explained the Second Amendment Foundation in a statement released July 10.

SAF Founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb heralded the settlement as a victory for free speech, and â€œa devastating blow to the gun prohibition lobby.â€

GLOCK MAKES MILITARY-GRADE PISTOL AVAILABLE TO CIVILIANS

The organizations had filed their suit against the State Department under the Obama administration. In May 2013, the government had cited International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) when clamping down on Defense Distributed. In its statement SAF described ITAR is a Cold War-era law designed to control export of military items.

The settlement has sparked anger from gun control advocates. â€œWe're extremely concerned about a sudden settlement by the DOJ allowing blueprints for 3-D printed guns to be posted online, and we're looking forward to learning through our FOIA request exactly how this came to be,â€ tweeted the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence on July 13.

The Brady Campaign filed its Freedom of Information Act request on Jul. 12.

ARMY SETS SIGHTS ON NEW SNIPER RIFLE

â€œDuring the Obama years, the government thought that 3D printed guns posed a serious threat to national security. I'm not aware of anything that has changed except who sits in the White House,â€ Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, told Fox News in an emailed statement. â€œUntraceable and undetectable guns that bypass our bipartisan background check system put us all at risk. The country deserves answers from the Trump Administration about why it thinks this is a good idea. Making it easier for dangerous people to get guns is reckless and stupid, and this is going to make Americans less safe.""

Advocates for gun control have argued that 3D-printed guns could also pose security challenges as they pass through airport X-ray machines.

Wilson, who describes current 3D-printed guns as â€œmostly curiosities,â€ said that the â€œbigâ€ and â€œbulkyâ€ characteristics of the weapons would help identify them. â€œI doubt seriously that itâ€™s a real problem,â€ he added. â€œIf it is a problem, then the [security] norms will have to change.â€

US MILITARY EYES FUTURISTIC 'BIONIC ARM' FOR TROOPS

The State Department has also provided some context on the settlement. â€œThis was a voluntary settlement entered into following negotiations between the Department of State and the plaintiffs,â€ said a State Department spokesperson, in a statement emailed to Fox News. â€œThe court did not rule in favor of the plaintiffs in this case. In other contexts, courts have upheld ITAR controls on technical data.â€

â€œThe settlement in this case comes as the U.S. Government is reviewing comments on new proposed regulations to transfer oversight from the U.S. Department of State to the U.S. Department of Commerce of exports of firearms and related items that do not provide the United States with a critical military or intelligence advantage or, in the case of weapons, are not inherently for military end use, including many items that are widely available in retail outlets in the United States and abroad,â€ the spokesperson added. â€œThese proposed regulations are part of an ongoing effort to create a simpler, more robust export control system that eases industry compliance, enhances enforceability, and better protects truly sensitive technologies.â€

The State Department says that, in addition to reducing regulatory burden on U.S. industry, the proposed regulations would eliminate the ITAR requirements at issue in the Defense Distributed case.

â€œIn the course of formulating these proposed regulations, the U.S. Government conducted a national security analysis in the context of the rulemaking effort,â€ the spokesperson added. â€œBased on this analysis, it was determined that certain firearms and related items that are widely available for commercial sale, and technical data related to those items, is of a type that does not offer a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States.â€

3E9ZFLPWOZA02WLYVG4FFK0NUUSIXX,Father blames 'stand your ground' in son's death,"Michael McGlockton is convinced that two things killed his son in a Florida parking lot last month: The man who pulled the trigger and the state's polarizing ""stand your ground"" self-defense law.

Markeis McGlockton, 28, died a few yards from his children and girlfriend at a store in Clearwater after a confrontation over a parking spot that reignited the debate over the law. The local sheriff said that under ""stand your ground,"" Michael Drejka was justified in the killing.

In an interview with The Associated Press -- his first one-on-one with a news outlet since the shooting -- Michael McGlockton said that if the law didn't exist, his son might have gone home the night of July 19, or Drejka might have been arrested. Instead, McGlockton said, he buried his firstborn while the killer walked free.

""No law should be able to protect somebody to the point that they kill somebody on the street and they can lay in the bed the same night,"" McGlockton said. ""To me and my family, that's a slap in the face. (Drejka) would've thought twice before he pulled the trigger. With the law, he knew that he could hide behind that.""

The law received international attention in 2012 when black teenager Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman. In the end, Zimmerman did not argue a ""stand your ground"" defense and was acquitted anyway. Critics say the law unfairly allows young black men to be victimized by gun violence.

The dispute with Drejka started when he yelled at McGlockton's girlfriend, Britany Jacobs -- who was in a car with two of the couple's small children -- outside a store for parking in a handicapped space. McGlockton, who was black and unarmed, pushed Drejka, a white man, to the ground. Drejka pulled out his handgun and killed him.

Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri has declined to press charges. State prosecutors are considering whether to charge Drejka, 47.

""I didn't make the law, and I do not do what people want because of outrage,"" Gualtieri said. ""If you're outraged by the law and don't like the law, then change it.""

The case drew hundreds to a rally last weekend in Clearwater.

Instead of scrapping the law, Florida lawmakers have strengthened it to force prosecutors to prove the shooting doesn't fall under a ""stand your ground"" defense. Previously, defendants had to prove why that defense applied.

A 2015 American Bar Association task force report on ""stand your ground laws"" found the statute is unpredictable, results in racial disparities, and undermines victims' rights. Additionally, the report said there was widespread confusion among law enforcement as to when shootings were justified.

Georgetown University law professor Paul Butler said the law does have a racially disparate effect that devalues black life. Because the law is predicated on the belief that an imminent threat exists, shootings are more likely to be considered justified by a judge or jury when white people shoot blacks, he said.

""White fear is seen as more reasonable than black fear,"" Butler said.

Dennis Baxley, a Republican legislator from Ocala and an initial ""stand your ground"" sponsor, says the law's intent was to make it clear that when people are attacked, they have a right to defend themselves.

""I don't think anyone should be raped or beaten because they think they would get in trouble for defending themselves,"" Baxley said.

Baxley called the Clearwater case a ""tough call"" but said it's up to the sheriff and prosecutor to decide whether a crime was committed.

Markeis McGlockton was 23 when Martin was killed in 2012. It was the first time Michael McGlockton, a lifelong Florida resident, had heard of ""stand your ground."" He said he thought the ""messed-up"" law should be changed but never imagined it would strike so personally.

McGlockton said it is his son who was defending himself and his family against a threat.

""Every man raises his kid to be that ultimate man for his family,"" McGlockton said. ""That's exactly what he was doing, standing up for his family. I'm so proud of him because he did exactly what I taught him to do.""

Nearly 30 years ago, McGlockton was sitting in Spanish class as a high school junior when he got the call that his girlfriend was in labor.

He rushed to the hospital, but by the time he arrived, Markeis had already entered the world. It was the best day of Michael's life.

""I stayed with him all night, crying,"" Michael McGlockton, now 46, recalled. ""I was just happy.""

Father and son were close. He chided his father for babying him, even as an adult. Warning him away from the mistakes he had made was simply McGlockton's way of showing love -- a word he began using with his son only a few years ago.

""A lot of grown men don't really say that to their sons,"" McGlockton said.

Their hometown, Clearwater, known for its beaches and sunshine, bills itself as ""a progressive city committed to enhancing residents' lives."" McGlockton wouldn't disagree, and seldom thought of Markeis' safety as the father of a black son.

But ""this law does not work in favor of black people,"" he said.

Like Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, Michael McGlockton and Monica Moore-Robinson want justice for their son's killing. He no longer wants or expects an apology from sheriff Gualtieri and regrets voting for him.

McGlockton hopes for a different outcome from prosecutors.

""Everybody in America can see that tape,"" McGlockton said, referring to the video of the confrontation. ""I'm hoping the state's attorney can see the exact same thing.""

McGlockton's family is focused on pushing for Drejka's arrest, prosecution and conviction. Then, he said, he'll focus on pushing to change the law.

""He didn't have to pull that trigger,"" McGlockton said. ""But because of 'stand your ground,' this is what happens.""",https://nypost.com/2018/08/08/father-blames-stand-your-ground-in-sons-death/,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Republican']","['1', '3', '5', '5', '4']"

First, drumpf pulled out the Al Capone reference, earlier this month applying the example of prosecutors putting the Chicago gangster in stir using the paper trail of his fraudulent tax returns as no one in his organization dared testify against the murderous thug, to his former campaign manager Paul Manafortâ€¦

...and now the NRA and Dana Loesch, historically knowing a specious argument when they hear one, is using the same analogy to sympathetically (?) frame drumpf himself.



Daily Intelligencer

â€œBut why waste such a clever historical analogy on a mere underling when it can be used on the boss himself? NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch informs her audience that the FBI is trying to pull the same tricks on Trump that they used to entrap the beloved Prohibition-era Chicago gang leader: â€œâ€Theyâ€™re trying to Al Capone the president. I mean, you remember. Capone didnâ€™t go down for murder. Elliot Ness didnâ€™t put him in for murder. He went in for tax fraud. Prosecutors didnâ€™t care how he went down as long as he went down.â€â€

Jonathan Chait, the author of the above piece, makes the case that going away for tax evasion would actually be the best case scenario for the Mango Monstrosity:

â€œYou might wonder why Trumpâ€™s supporters believe his legal defense is aided by analogizing him to a murderous criminal. Perhaps the answer is that Capone had several qualities that recommend him to the Republican grassroots base. He was a business owner â€” or, in modern Republican lingo, a Job Creator. He was an avid Second Amendment enthusiast. And, most importantly, Capone, like Trump, was a victim of the deep state. Loeschâ€™s argument centers on the fact that Capone was convicted for tax evasion, rather than more serious crimes like ordering murders or bribing public officials. Loesch doesnâ€™t argue that Capone was innocent of tax evasion. (Though who could blame him for not wanting to hand over his hard-earned income to wasteful government bureaucracies?) Instead she argues that the prosecutorial injustice done to him was charging him for something other than his worst and most famous crime. Here she is relying on the well-known legal principle of Anglo-American jurisprudence. You canâ€™t charge Al Capone with tax evasion, and you canâ€™t charge Donald Trump with campaign finance violations. A person can only be charged with their worst crime. And now Trump is prepared to join Al Capone as one of historyâ€™s most sympathetic victims of prosecutorial misconduct.â€

So lets be clear, Danaâ€¦

Removing drumpf from office and transporting him to Sing Sing to rot for tax evasion wouldnâ€™t be our preferred choice, but, you know, if thatâ€™s what it takesâ€¦.

Somehow though, I think Bob Mueller has a grander exit in mind for the traitor.

3XAOZ9UYR095TTOO1VOHTDN8GY71QM,â€˜She was like a noveltyâ€™: How alleged Russian agent Maria Butina gained access to elite conservative circles,"For nearly five years, the young Russian political-science student was an unusual fixture at the most important events of the U.S. conservative movement.

Maria Butina, who was indicted this week on charges of being a covert Russian agent, struck up friendships with the influential leaders of the National Rifle Association and the Conservative Political Action Conference, touting her interest in U.S. affairs and efforts to promote gun rights in VladiÂ­mir Putinâ€™s restrictive Russia. She sidled up to GOP presidential candidates, seeking first an encounter with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and then, after his rising candidacy stumbled, with Donald Trump.

But by August 2016, when she moved to the United States on a student visa, the FBI was watching, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter.

Rather than question or confront her, they said, officials decided to track her movements to determine whom she was meeting and what she was doing in the United States â€” the kind of monitoring that is not uncommon when foreign nationals are suspected of working on behalf of a foreign government.

By then, Butina had already publicly quizzed Trump about his views on Russia and briefly met his eldest son at an NRA convention. After the FBI began monitoring her, Butina attended a ball at Trumpâ€™s inauguration and tried to arrange a meeting between him and a senior Russian government official at last yearâ€™s annual National Prayer Breakfast.

By 2017, after she had enrolled as a graduate student at American University in Washington, Butina began probing groups on the left as well, trying unsuccessfully to interview a D.C.-based civil rights group about its cyber-vulnerabilities for what she said was a school project, according to a person familiar with her outreach.

[Guns and religion: How American conservatives grew closer to Putinâ€™s Russia]

On Sunday, alerted that she was preparing to leave Washington for South Dakota, where monitoring her would be more difficult, federal authorities arrested Butina.

The 29-year-old was indicted by a grand jury on Tuesday, accused of conspiracy and failing to register as a foreign agent. The indictment alleges that she worked with her contact in the Russian government to infiltrate American political groups as part of a scheme â€œto advance the interests of the Russian Federation.â€

Robert Driscoll, an attorney for Butina, said she is not a Russian agent but merely a student with an interest in politics and a desire to network with Americans. â€œShe intends to defend her rights vigorously and looks forward to clearing her name,â€ he said in a statement.

U.S. officials allege that her activities show the breadth and sophistication of Russiaâ€™s influence operations in the United States. At the same time prosecutors say 12 Russian intelligence officers in Moscow sought to affect the 2016 presidential campaign by hacking and releasing stolen documents from Democrats, Butina was roaming the country, building ties on the Kremlinâ€™s behalf with powerful conservative figures, according to court filings.

â€œThe filing of this latest complaint is just further evidence of how far-reaching and carefully planned Russiaâ€™s assault on American democracy has been,â€ said a former U.S. official with knowledge of the Russia investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing probe. â€œTo anyone who doubts that the Russian counterintelligence threat is real, this complaint should be further proof that itâ€™s a threat that is live, real and urgent for the country to grapple with.â€

Butinaâ€™s activities raise questions about why the NRA and other groups gave her high-level access, allowing her to meet important politicians and influential thought leaders.

NRA officials did not respond to requests for comment.

People who encountered Butina said the gregarious redhead had a life story that appealed to many activists and officials she met at GOP events. She told a conservative radio show in 2015 that she grew up in the woods of Siberia, where her father taught her and her sister to hunt bears and wolves.

After a brief career as the owner of a small chain of furniture stores, Butina moved to Moscow, where she began a career in public relations and founded a group called the Right to Bear Arms to advocate for the loosening of Russiaâ€™s restrictive gun laws.

Soon, her group acquired a powerful patron, a Russian senator from Putinâ€™s party who later became the deputy director of Russiaâ€™s central bank: Alexander Torshin, a lifetime member of the NRA who had ties with Christian conservatives through an annual prayer breakfast he helped host in Moscow.

Acting as Torshinâ€™s assistant and interpreter, Butina soon began forming her own connections to the NRA, becoming friendly with David Keene, a past chairman of the American Conservative Union who served as the NRAâ€™s president from 2011 to 2013, as The Washington Post previously reported.

[In the crowd at Trumpâ€™s inauguration, members of Russiaâ€™s elite anticipated a thaw between Moscow and Washington]

In 2013, Butina and Torshin invited Keene and other American gun enthusiasts to Moscow to attend the annual meeting of her organization.

There, Butina met Paul Erickson, a South Dakota-based Republican operative who was well known to Republican insiders, going back to the work he did as national political director for Pat Buchananâ€™s presidential campaign in 1992. She told the Senate Intelligence Committee in April that she began a romantic relationship with the American operative, people familiar with her testimony said.

Erickson matches a description of an American described in court filings as a political operative who helped introduce Butina to influential American political figures â€œfor the purpose of advancing the agenda of the Russian Federation.â€

Erickson, who has not been charged, did not respond to requests for comment.

Starting in 2014, Butina began attending annual NRA conventions, according to her social Â­media accounts. She and Torshin got unusual access to elite NRA gatherings, according to a person familiar with NRA event arrangements. In recent years, they were regular guests at Golden Ring of Freedom dinners and VIP events reserved for people who typically donate $1 million to the NRA.

Butina told the Senate Intelligence Committee that neither she nor Torshin made contributions to the NRA other than membership dues, according to people familiar with her testimony. Their warm treatment was extended merely to thank them for serving as hosts to NRA leaders in Moscow, she said.

The NRA, which spent millions more to support Trump than any previous presidential candidate, has denied accepting funding from Butina or Torshin. In an April letter to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), an NRA official said that other than membership dues, Torshin â€œhas not made any contributions and is therefore not a member of any major donor program.â€

The NRA gave Butina a springboard into the world of Republican politics. In March 2015, court documents show that she and Erickson exchanged emails about a special â€œdiplomacyâ€ project, aiming to use the organization to influence the Republican Party, which Butina predicted would win control of the White House.

At the groupâ€™s annual convention in Nashville that year, which featured a dozen presidential hopefuls, they mingled with headliners in a VIP green room, according to a person who was present.

In a social media post, Butina wrote that she met Walker and was surprised when she was able to exchange a few words in Russian with the Wisconsin governor, who was preparing a bid for the presidency and leading in polls. A Walker spokesman said Tuesday that there were thousands of people at the convention and that â€œmany of them approached the governor and asked to say hello and take a photo with him.â€

Later in 2015, she attended Walkerâ€™s kickoff political rally in Wisconsin and a town hall for candidates in Las Vegas, where candidates Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Trump were speaking. She also helped arrange a meeting for Torshin in St. Petersburg with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), who was visiting with a congressional delegation on a trip cited in court filings.

Butina was spotted in VIP areas at political events such as CPAC, giving her access to organization leaders and top staff, according to people who saw her there.

â€œHello, I am Russian,â€ one veteran CPAC attendee recalled she told him as she introduced herself, quickly asking questions in accented but otherwise excellent English: â€œWhat do you do? Who do you back for president?â€

The CPAC veteran, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, recalled her as â€œfriendly, curious and flirtatious.â€

Daniel Schneider, the executive director of the American Conservative Union, which sponsors CPAC, said in an emailed statement that Butina â€œwas never authorized to enter any greenroom or VIP reception. If she got in, she was snuck in, in violation of our rules and security protocols.â€ He said that the organization has â€œno associationâ€ with Erickson or Butina, and said that Erickson â€œwas removed from the ACU Board for cause and has not been allowed to attend CPAC in recent years.â€

According to people who met her, Butina often raised the issue of gun rights before asking to exchange business cards and to stay in touch on social media, according to people who met her.

â€œShe was like a novelty,â€ said Saul Anuzis, a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, who met Butina at a handful of conservative events in 2016. â€œShe ran a gun rights group in Russia and, by definition, with the kind of repression under Putin, your assumption was that was kind of a revolutionary, radical thing.â€

[Trump says he accepts U.S. intelligence on Russian interference in 2016 election but denies collusion]

In a 2017 email to The Washington Post, Butina argued that her group was â€œnot very popularâ€ with Russian officials. She said she received no funding from the Russian government. â€œNo government official has EVER approached me about â€˜fostering tiesâ€™ with any Americans,â€ she wrote.

Igor Shmelyov, the chairman of the Russian group Butina founded, said her arrest came as a â€œgreat shock.â€

â€œMaria is interested in guns, so of course her social circle is connected to this,â€ he said, adding that she interacted with supporters of the NRA and the Second Amendment Foundation because of that personal interest. â€œTo say that all this means she was lobbying for Russian interests is rather ridiculous.â€

But according to the FBI, she spoke frequently with a â€œhigh-level official in the Russian governmentâ€ about her efforts to broker better ties between Russia and the United States. The description matches Torshin, who was among 17 senior Russian government officials penalized by the U.S. government in April for playing a role in advancing Russiaâ€™s â€œmalign activities.â€ In March 2016, she emailed an American contact that Putinâ€™s administration had expressed approval for her and Torshinâ€™s efforts to build a â€œcommunication channelâ€ in the U.S., according to court filings.

â€œMaria Butina is currently in the USA. She writes me that D. Trump (an NRA member) is truly in favor of cooperation with Russia,â€ Torshin tweeted in Russian in February 2016.

The following month, she emailed an American contact that Torshin had received approval from Putinâ€™s administration for their efforts, according to court filings.

On the night of Trumpâ€™s election victory, the filings say, she messaged Torshin, â€œIâ€™m going to sleep. Itâ€™s 3 a.m. here. I am ready for further orders.â€

Erickson lobbied for a role in Trumpâ€™s transition team and complained after the election when he ran into a problem with his security clearance, according to people familiar with the situation.

Even without official credentials, he pressed Trump donors and former campaign officials, pushing for top positions for people he thought especially qualified. One person recalled his lobbying to get K.T. McFarland named as an adviser to Michael Flynn, Trumpâ€™s first national security adviser.

As scrutiny grew of Russian actions during the campaign, Butinaâ€™s work in her role as a graduate student at American University attracted notice as well. She sparked alarm at one Washington-area civil rights group in June 2017, when she asked to interview the groupâ€™s director about its vulnerability to cyberattacks for a school project.

â€œIt was inÂ­credÂ­ibly suspect activity,â€ said Jon Steinman, co-founder of HillCyber, a cybersecurity firm that consulted with the group. Steinman said he immediately contacted the FBI and was interviewed about the episode at length in January.

Driscoll, Butinaâ€™s attorney, said the inquiry was not surprising given that she was enrolled in a cybersecurity program. An American University spokesman confirmed that Butina graduated with a masterâ€™s degree in May but otherwise declined to comment.

With her degree in hand, Butina prepared to leave Washington for South Dakota this weekend. Then the FBI moved in.

3BFF0DJK8YUIFTFAVIXWUJL4QW6STG,Vehicle Terrorism and Humanity's Crooked Timber,"Here's a thesis statement for New Urbanists to consider: it's hard to enjoy being a flaneur if someone is trying to mow you down with a motor vehicle, or if the cops are shooting to stop the mowing. That is, a pedestrian taking in the sights ought not to have to worry about being struck by a car or truck, or perhaps being hit by a stray bullet.

Such thoughts are summoned to mind by this Washington Post headline: ""Police in D.C., New York revise shooting policies in response to vehicle ramming attacks."" As the Post's May 1 story details, in the wake of the spate of ramming attacks around the world, police forces are reversing their decades-old policies against shooting at dangerous moving vehicles.

Reluctantly, one might conclude that the authorities have no choice. It's one thing to tell the police that they shouldn't shoot at, say, getaway cars, because the collateral risks are too high; it's another to demand they hold their fire at the moment of murderous vehicular mayhem.

One could further say that the April 23 attack in Toronto, which left 10 dead and 15 injured, is particularly scary because the alleged killer was not a jihadi. Instead, he was apparently an ""incel,"" which is one of those new categories of pathology that the Internet seems good at discovering, and in a perverse way at glamorizing and multiplying.

In other words, ramming has transcended the stereotype about killers as ISIS wannabes. It's now an equal-opportunity thing, a wicked kind of performance art, a sick-yet-easy option for anyone with a sufficiently malevolent turn of mind.

So what to do? How to respond to this threat? For the moment, let's confine ourselves to the immediate issue of safeguarding streets and walkways. As for the underlying problem of human nature, let's wish the healers and therapists the best, even as we remember the realist wisdom of Immanuel Kant: ""Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made.""

Still, as we live our lives in a bent condition, we can at least try to make straight the path to greater urban safety. Here are four possible categories of solutions.

First, applying on-the-spot restraint. This includes, of course, shooting at the driver. Without a doubt, firing at moving targets is at best a least-worst strategy, given the difficulty of aiming and the great risk of hitting innocent bystanders.

So we might ask: are there better mechanisms of immediate restraint? Could we have pop-up barriers or force fields? Traps or nets of some kind? Lasers or some sort of pulse device that turns off the vehicle? In speculating on such technological fixes, we should have confidence that there will be plenty of clever ideas for gadgets -- and some might even work. Of course, we should also be mindful that any safety device that kicks into gear will likely be controlled by some sort of artificial intelligence, and, as this author has argued, that opens up new vistas of the problematic.

Second, banning cars in pedestrian-dense areas. Many cities have been moving in this direction: in the past, the rationale has been aesthetic or environmental, but nowadays safety is another valid reason. Indeed, even without ramming, motor vehicles bring trouble, killing some 6,000 pedestrians each year. So in some places, banning vehicles would also solve the ramming problem.

On the other hand, in a country of 325 million people, there are a lot of pedestrian-dense areas, and so prohibiting vehicles for the sake of safety is hardly a scalable solution. Moreover, as President Trump pointed out while speaking to the NRA convention in Dallas on Friday, ""van control"" would raise all the same objections as ""gun control."" And, of course, cars have a lot more support than guns.

Third, accelerating the push toward driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles (AV). That is, if we can't ban cars, maybe we can ban car drivers. The AV idea, actively pushed by Silicon Valley, seemingly offers the promise of eliminating wheeled human murderousness, because the computer would be doing the driving -- or perhaps, in the name of safety, the emergency overriding.

Yet on the matter of safety, a string of accidents, including fatal accidents, has shaken public confidence in AV. Actually, come to think of it, maybe the public has never wanted AV. Maybe all along it's been a top-down lobbying campaign pushed by Silicon Valley's money and prestige.

In the wake of an AV fatality in March, Uber announced a pause in AV testing, which seemed like a fair acknowledgement of public concern. And then, just last Friday, we learned that another tech company, Waymo, owned by Google, had still been AV-ing -- and was involved in another accident, this one mercifully non-fatal.

Obviously, the tech lords have gotten way ahead of themselves on AV -- and more to the point, way ahead of public opinion. Yes, techsters have much invested in their AV projects, but the American people have much invested in their own lives. And as long as it's votes -- as opposed to campaign donations -- that are counted on Election Day, politicians will have to heed the wariness of voters more than the eagerness of donors. So in light of these murky politics, an AV solution to ramming is nothing to count on.

Fourth, building barriers. In the last three and a half decades -- ever since the 1983 truck-bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon -- a pattern has emerged: if a building is judged to be truly important, it is to be defended by an immobile phalanx of bollards or other kinds of obstacles, including, sigh, the distinctly unsightly jersey barrier.

Typically, these protected buildings are public structures, but some high-profile private buildings, too, have the benefit of barriers. For example, the immediate area around Trump Tower in Manhattan is a car-proof fortress, and other name-worthy private buildings -- such as the nearby Bank of America Tower -- have the same fixed counter-terror protection.

As this author wrote for TAC last year, bollards can be seen as ""passive defense."" Passive defense is just what it sounds like: it's just there, always on guard. The alternative is, of course, ""active defense."" And while active defense might seem better because, well, it's active, it will certainly be more expensive and might sometimes even be less effective.

After all, with active defense, there will always be technical complexity -- and thus the greater risk of Murphy's Law. By contrast, passive defense, in its low-tech simplicity, is always ""on,"" whether or not it's plugged in or wired up, and that makes it about as snafu-proof as anything humans can create. (This author has sung the praises of passive defense earlier, here and here.)

To be sure, the issue of putting barriers around buildings is controversial. Back in 2006, for example, New York City began restricting the placement of barriers around buildings. After all, some of them were definitely eyesores, and probably all of them had at least some inhibiting effect on traffic and people flow.

Yet the active march toward passive defense is likely to continue -- for the simple reason that, in its stark simplicity, it does the job. Moreover, with some thought, barriers could be made prettier; they could be disguised as benches, or tables, or statuary. They could even be trees -- perhaps, if need be, reinforced trees.

In the meantime, another new phenomenon in the built environment, protected bicycle lanes, points the way to another kind of passive solution. That is, bike lanes with curbs that separate bicyclists from motorists are an obviously good idea for the protection of the two-wheeled. And it's easy to see how curbed bike lanes could double as passive defense for pedestrians and buildings from the four-wheeled threat.

Of course, a lively debate about such matters is not just inevitable; it's useful. The dialectic is the fastest route to sustainable solutions. In that vein, it would be interesting to hear more from major landlords, including federal ones like the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the General Services Administration. And it would be equally constructive to hear from artists, urbanists, activists, and the citizenry. For the sake of aesthetics as well as safety, a national conversation is needed.

Not everyone, to be sure, will like the idea of passive barriers, because there's always someone who objects. As Voltaire said, it's easier to conquer the universe than to get a single village to agree -- and America is a mighty big village.

Still, until we get to the world where humans are made from non-crooked timber, it's likely that a critical mass of people will agree on the need for barriers as a relatively cheap -- and extremely important -- urban safety measure.",https://www.theamericanconservative.com/urbs/vehicle-terrorism-and-humanitys-crooked-timber/,"['Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","['3', '3', '4', '1', '2']"
3KA7IJSNW7NL6F513F2HZKA7XEBPB1,Fossil Fuel Industries Outspend Clean Energy Advocates On Climate Lobbying By 10 To 1,"George Frey via Getty Images Emissions rise out of three large smokestacks at Pacificorp's coal-fired power plant in Castle Dale, Utah, last October.

Fossil fuel producers, airlines and electrical utilities outspent environmental groups and the renewable energy industry 10 to 1 on lobbying related to climate change legislation between 2000 and 2016, according to a new analysis released Wednesday.

The research, which will be published Thursday in the journal Climate Change, suggests that, at a time when the majority of Americans understand global warming and support government action to deal with it, industry lobbying still has far greater influence in Washington.

â€œPublic opinion is pretty much a minor factor in deciding what Congress is going to do,â€ said Robert Brulle, the studyâ€™s author and a sociologist at Drexel University.

Money spent on lobbying, he said, is likely a much bigger determinant of whether federal legislation gets off the ground.

â€œWe seem to have a public opinion fetish where if we get public opinion to be supportive of climate change legislation, then itâ€™ll happen,â€ Brulle said. â€œMy answer to that is, gee, well, we should have gun control legislation then.â€

During the period examined by the study, expenditures on federal lobbying aimed at climate issues topped $2 billion, representing on average 3.9 percent of annual federal lobbying dollars. That spending fluctuated by year. In 2009, it surged to more than 9 percent of the total as Congress debated the American Clean Energy and Security Act, which would have established a cap-and-trade market to limit greenhouse gas emissions and allow companies to buy and sell permits to pollute. The bill failed in the Senate in 2010.

To conduct the analysis, Brulle downloaded nearly 2 million publicly available lobbying files collected by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Searching for a dozen key terms â€• including â€œclimate change,â€ â€œglobal warmingâ€ and â€œcarbonâ€ â€• he pinpointed more than 64,100 reports of such lobbying, identified the reports by business sector, and compared those figures to the sectorsâ€™ annual overall spending on lobbying.

Robert Brulle A chart from Robert Brulle's study shows the industry breakdown of federal climate change lobbying expenditures from 2000 to 2016.

That $2 billion total represents a conservative estimate of industry spending to sway lawmakers on climate issues. Federal disclosure rules only require reports from people who are paid to lobby on behalf of a client, make more than one contact with government officials working on a bill and spend more than 20 percent of their time on lobbying activities. Many other representatives of major corporate interests lobby the government but keep it under 20 percent of their time. The total also does not cover activities such as mobilizing outside groups, getting op-eds published in media outlets or directing public relations campaigns that may shape legislation.

The climate change denial movement remains powerful if splintered. Oil giants traditionally funded the network of misinformation outlets seeding doubt about the role of fossil fuels in warming the planet. But in recent years, right-wing ideologues, such as the billionaire hedge funders of the Mercer family and the industrialist Koch brothers have become the movementâ€™s chief financiers.

Exxon Mobil, once the leading architect of the climate denial network, abruptly quit the Koch-backed American Legislative Exchange Council this month after a disagreement over an Environmental Protection Agency policy affirming the science behind climate change. BP and Royal Dutch Shell had already left the conservative policy group.

The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas sectorâ€™s top lobbying group, noted the studyâ€™s finding that the fossil fuel industry spent nearly 18 percent of all climate lobbying dollars during the period examined, but suggested it wasnâ€™t the whole story. In a statement, spokesman Reid Porter said the industry â€œalso invests more in the development and deployment of greenhouse gas reducing technologies.â€

The Sierra Club, which made up part of the 2.3 percent sliver of climate lobbying dollars that came from environmental groups, blamed â€œthe unlimited money fossil fuel polluters have poured into our political systemâ€ for making â€œthe debate on the climate crisis in the United States â€¦ radically different than in every other country on earth.â€ To try to counter that disparity in lobbying dollars, legislative director Melinda Pierce said the nonprofit mobilizes â€œmore than three million members and supporters.â€

Robert Brulle Another chart from the study shows how industries' climate lobbying expenditures changed year to year.

Brulle suggested that climate advocates could exploit differences between industry sectors that have historically opposed climate legislation as a way to disrupt their lobbying power. Utilities that generate a larger portion of energy from natural gas or renewable power were more likely to lobby in favor of climate legislation, he said, than their coal-powered competitors.

A 2017 paper from Australian National University researcher Christian Downie laid out a strategy that included building coalitions among renewable energy players, exploiting inter-industry divisions by targeting â€œpolitically weak industries that are less able to mount a resistance campaign,â€ and exploiting intra-industry divisions by â€œseeking to bring on board outliers that support policies that the rest of an industry opposes.â€

But any strategy faces significant challenges.

The Trump administration has little use for efforts to fight climate change. The EPA under then-Administrator Scott Pruitt started the process to repeal the Clean Power Plan, a federal rule that would have incentivized utilities to use more renewable energy and scale back emissions from coal. It also moved to gut a regulation that would have raised the fuel efficiency of vehicles, now the countryâ€™s biggest source of greenhouse gas pollution, at the behest of auto manufacturers who publicly claim to support climate action. Thereâ€™s little reason to believe Andrew Wheeler, the new EPA chief and a former coal and mining lobbyist, will shift gears.

We seem to have a public opinion fetish where if we get public opinion to be supportive of climate change legislation, then itâ€™ll happen. Robert Brulle of Drexel University

Meanwhile, corporations that profess concern about the environment are not always reliable allies. A study published last year in the peer-reviewed Academy of Management Journal found that several big companies that had announced ambitious sustainability goals later retreated when profits decreased or top executives changed.

Legislation ambitious enough to make a difference at a time when fossil fuel emissions are hitting an all-time high and climate change appears to be happening faster and more intensely than previously thought faces yet another hurdle. The false belief that scientists are not yet certain about humanityâ€™s role in global warming all but dominates the Republican Party and undergirds the Trump administrationâ€™s environmental, national security and energy policies. Meanwhile, Democrats have failed to rally around a bold climate plan, instead intermittently producing legislation to set renewable energy goals with no clear roadmap on how to achieve them. Even the most purportedly hawkish Democrats on climate change have proposed conservative policies to deal with it, including a carbon tax that would have lowered the corporate tax rate by 6 percent and a cap-and-dividend bill that would have returned carbon revenues to Americans in the form of a rebate.

An insurgent group of progressive candidates running in the 2018 midterm elections could shift the debate within Democratic policy circles. Some House candidates â€• including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Randy Bryce of Wisconsin and Kaniela Ing of Hawaii â€• are calling for a Green New Deal, a massive government spending plan to build up renewable energy production and create potentially millions of federally backed middle-class jobs. Some left-leaning think tanks are also drafting proposals to nationalize and dismantle publicly traded fossil fuel giants.

But at a time when rising floods, droughts, heat waves, storms and wildfires afflict the country â€• causing a record $306 billion in damages last year â€• radical action seems far past due.

â€œWe are already much farther down the road than we ever should have allowed,â€ said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. â€œThis is the true cost of the climate change denial campaign.â€",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fossil-fuel-industries-climate-lobbying_us_5b4f8fdee4b0de86f4894831,"['Strongly Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Democratic', 'Strongly Democratic']","['2', '1', '1', '1', '1']"

A DEFININGa DEBATE FOR FLORIDA POLITICS

ORLANDO â€“ Other than giving us a chance to pick up some Mickey ears and grab a fried grouper sandwich, why is Fox News hosting a Florida gubernatorial debate here tonight?

Itâ€™s pretty simple: What happens in Florida politics right now may matter more than in any other state.

Florida has 29 electoral votes, the same as New York and more than every state except California and Texas. By the time we get to the 2020 Census, the Sunshine State will have gained at least 3 million new residents since 2010 and be ready to join an elite club of three electoral heavyweights.

Most importantly, Florida is by far the largest swing state. The shape of Americaâ€™s political future will be decided in substantial part by what voters here do. So, we tend to care more about the direction and intensity of the political trade winds in Florida than in most places.

No Democrat has been elected governor of Florida in 24 years. And in that time, the nominees that Republicans have picked have tried to stick to the model established by Jeb Bush in his eight years â€“ a conciliatory kind of conservatism.

Both of those things may change this year.

Democrats seem to be coalescing around former Miami Beach Mayor Phillip Levine, who got richer than Croesus in the cruise ship business and then turned his focus to politics. Heâ€™s running as a moderate pragmatist with a â€œget it doneâ€ mantra. If he does indeed prevail over top rival Rep. Gwen Graham, daughter of longtime Democratic Sen. Bob Graham, in the Aug. 28 primary Levine will pose a different kind of opponent than Florida Republicans are used to.

Levineâ€™s deep pockets, persuasive delivery and willingness to do battle on behalf of liberal causes like gun control and the environment â€“ very popular among Floridians â€“could be very disruptive in a state that has tended to litigate statewide races between the ideological 40-yard lines.

But how will Republicans respond? Tonightâ€™s debate will say a great deal about that.

Itâ€™s hard to be a fixture at anything at age 43, but frontrunner Adam Putnam has managed to do so. He won election to the state legislature at age 22, served two terms representing his rural Central Florida district before winning a seat in the House and becoming the youngest member of Congress at age 26. He served for a decade as a popular and reliably conservative member of the House. In 2010, he ran for and handily won election as the stateâ€™s agricultural commissioner.

Where you live, the agriculture commission may not be a big deal, but it is in Florida. The state has 47,000 farms generating nearly $9 billion a year and the agency oversees a great deal beyond just farms. Most importantly for tonight, though, itâ€™s one of five statewide, state-level elected offices. Heâ€™s won twice and in 2014 was the top vote getter in the state.

Ron DeSantis, on the other hand, is a relative newcomer.

Just 36, he has represented a strongly Republican House district in the northeastern part of the state since 2013. He won the first time in a crowded six-way primary in which his background as a Navy lawyer and former federal prosecutor with double Ivy League diplomas helped him stand out.

In Congress, he has aligned himself closely first with the populist Freedom Caucus. First as a staunch foe of the Obama administration and now as one of the most outspoken defenders of President Trump, DeSantis made himself a nearly ubiquitous presence on cable news.

He has taken a back seat to no one in his efforts to derail the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and working to discredit the FBI, both of which have made him a favorite of MAGA Republicans across the country.

DeSantis has tried to bring that scorched-earth approach to the race here, but so far, that hasnâ€™t been enough to make the difference. Polls here have consistently shown him trailing the better-known Putnam by wide margins. With two months to go and all eyes in Florida politics on a ballroom here at the Gaylord Palms Resort, heâ€™s got the chance to try to reset the race.

Can he show that heâ€™s ready to govern a diverse, growing state of 21 million? Can he also demonstrate that heâ€™s ready for a general election fight in a state that is among the most narrowly divided in American politics?

Can Putnam adapt to the new populist tone in his party without abandoning the traditional conservative policies that have already made him one of the most popular and successful politicians in the state?

We will find out tonight starting at 6:30 ET when moderators Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum start putting them through their paces.



THE RULEBOOK: DIFFERENCE IN OPINION

â€œThose who have but a superficial acquaintance with the sources from which they are to be drawn, will themselves recollect a variety of instances; and those who have a tolerable knowledge of human nature will not stand in need of such lights to form their opinion either of the reality or extent of that agency.â€ â€“ Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 6

TIME OUT: FLORIDAâ€™S FIRST TOURIST

History: â€œNear present-day St. Augustine, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon comes ashore on the Florida coast, and claims the territory for the Spanish crown. Although other European navigators may have sighted the Florida peninsula before, Ponce de Leon is credited with the first recorded landing and the first detailed exploration of the Florida coast. The Spanish explorer was searching for the â€˜Fountain of Youth,â€™ a fabled water source that was said to bring eternal youth. Ponce de Leon named the peninsula he believed to be an island â€˜La Floridaâ€™ because his discovery came during the time of the Easter feast, or Pascua Florida. In 1521, he returned to Florida in an effort to establish a Spanish colony on the island. However, hostile Native Americans attacked his expedition soon after landing, and the party retreated to Cuba, where Ponce de Leon died from a mortal wound suffered during the battle. Successful Spanish colonization of the peninsula finally began at St. Augustine in 1565, and in 1819 the territory passed into U.S. control under the terms of the Florida Purchase Treaty between Spain and the United States.â€

BOTH PARTIES SEE SURGE IN PRIMARY VOTERS

The Hill: â€œA surge in voter enthusiasm has prompted millions more Democrats to cast ballots in primary elections this year, a turnout explosion ahead of midterms in which motivation to vote is key to the party's chances of reclaiming control of the House. However, Republican voters also are showing up in higher numbers than in previous midterm cycles, a sign that the GOP's fate will be sealed not by apathetic conservatives who sit out Election Day, but by voters open to persuasion from both parties. The Hill's analysis of primary elections held in 30 states so far, through Tuesday night's contests, shows voters in both parties are turning out in higher numbers than in either of the last two midterm elections. Almost 13.8 million people have voted in Democratic primary contests this year â€” 5 million more than the 8.7 million who had voted in the same states in the 2014 midterm elections, according to data maintained by state elections offices.â€



Dems come closer to solving â€˜superdelegateâ€™ disagreement - WaPo: â€œThe Democratic National Committeeâ€™s two-year debate over its presidential primary rules came closer to resolution Wednesday, as its key rulemaking body voted to curtail the power of unpledged delegates â€” so-called â€˜superdelegatesâ€™ â€” at the next convention. At the end of a three-hour conference call, which was opened to the public, the Rules and Bylaws Committee adopted a compromise that grew out of lengthy negotiations between supporters of Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2016 campaign and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). In the past, superdelegates were able to vote on the first ballot at the convention, for any nominee. The new rule would prohibit superdelegates from voting until a second ballot, or in the event a candidate arrived at the convention with enough pledged delegates â€” earned in primaries and caucuses â€” to secure the nomination.â€

Obama will hit the campaign trail - CNBC: â€œFormer President Barack Obamahas been laying low when it comes to taking on President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. Thatâ€™s not going to last much longer. The most high-profile member of the Democratic Party is expected to hit the campaign trail for House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates running in the midterm elections while getting guidance from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The timeline is fluid but the former president is expected to start making an impact in Septemberâ€¦â€

FARM BILL GETS DELAYED IN THE SENATE

Politico: â€œSenate leadership's goal of holding a floor vote on the farm bill this week is now in doubt, as key farm-state lawmakers work to resolve a new demand from Sen. Marco Rubio over a provision that would promote agricultural trade with Cuba. The Florida Republican on Wednesday declared on Twitter that heâ€™d block any new amendments to the farm bill unless the Senate votes to strike a provision that would allow USDA funding for foreign market development programs to be spent in Cuba â€” or until senators adopt his proposal to ban U.S. taxpayer dollars from being spent on businesses owned by the Cuban military. After a full day of debate on Wednesday, the Senate had only cleared a managerâ€™s package by unanimous consent that contains 18 mostly uncontroversial amendments, including new protections for pollinators and provisions that would increase funding for the milk donation program and raise the catastrophic coverage level under an insurance program for milk producers.â€

The Judgeâ€™s Ruling: Letâ€™s be constitutional - This week, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano ask if immigrants can be deported without a trial: â€œThe forced separation by the government of children from their parents without a trial when neither is a danger to the other is child abuse or kidnapping or both. When federal authorities engage in such morally repellant behavior -- whether as a negotiating technique to bring the president's political adversaries to the bargaining table or to coerce the immigrants to go home -- it exposes them to state prosecution because of the acute and long-term harm they have caused to the children. â€¦ If he had asked his lawyers first, he would have learned that there is no legal basis for his official antipathy to due process.â€ More here.

PAPER, PLASTIC OR REPTILE?

Miami Herald: â€œA two-foot alligator didn't stroll into the Lakewood Ranch Wawa on its own earlier this month. Investigators have charged a 17-year-old boy they say grabbed the alligator from the wild and dropped it off inside the convenience store. At about 2:30 a.m. June 15, someone dropped off the gator at the Wawa at 14510 State Road 70 in Lakewood Ranch, according to the Manatee County Sheriff's Office. Deputies responded and called the Fish and Wildlife Commission, who sent a trapper out to the Wawa. The two-foot alligator was relocated to a suitable environment, according to FWC, and was not injured. On Friday, the teenager was issued a citation charging him with illegally possessing or harvesting an American alligator, a second-degree misdemeanor. The teen was not arrested but given notice to appear in court on July 21.â€
